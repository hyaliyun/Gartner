The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. Question: Who were those placed on stretchers? Options:  A. not enough information  B.

Lindsey Graham said on Sunday the inability to track Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is either a failure of the FBI or of U.S. laws.      “The ball was dropped in one of two ways,” Graham (R-S.C.) said on CNN’s State of the Union.” “The FBI missed a lot of things, is one potential answer, or our laws do not allow the FBI to follow up in a sound solid way.”      Graham said one of the suspects was an obvious red flag because of his activity online where he talked about killing Americans, and because of his travels into radical areas.      “It’s people like this that you don’t want to let out of your sight, and this was a mistake,” he said. “Either our laws are insufficient or the FBI failed, but we’re at war with radical Islamists and we need to up our game.”      Read more about: Lindsey Graham, FBI, Boston Marathon, Tamerlan Tsarnaev ||||| Surveillance video from the Boston Marathon attack shows one suspect dropping his backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside exploded, Massachusetts Gov.

Investigators have determined the bombs were fashioned from pressure cookers packed with explosives, nails and ball bearings and hidden in black backpacks. Three people were killed and more than 180 injured when the two bombs exploded Monday about four hours into the race.      Tsarnaev was captured Friday after being pulled bloody and wounded from a tarp-covered boat in a suburban Boston backyard. He is being guarded by armed officers while he recovers at a Boston hospital. He is in serious condition and hasn't been able to communicate with investigators.      His 26-year-old brother and alleged accomplice, Tamerlan, died earlier Friday after a gunbattle with police.      The brothers are also suspected of killing an MIT police officer Thursday and severely injuring a transit officer.      Patrick said Sunday on CBS' \\"Face the Nation\\" that law enforcement officials believe the immediate threat ended when police killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and captured Dzhokhar.

The FBI says the two brothers and suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing killed an MIT police officer,... (Associated Press)      As Boston-area residents came together in prayer and reflection after a tumultuous week, the lone surviving suspect in the bombing lay hospitalized under heavy guard apparently in no shape for interrogation.      What 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will say and when are unclear. He remained in serious condition two days after being pulled bloody and wounded from a tarp-covered boat in a Watertown backyard. The capture came at the end of a tense Friday that began with his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, dying in a gun battle with police.      There was no immediate word on when Tsarnaev might be charged and what those charges would be. The twin bombings killed three people and wounded more than 180.      The most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.      Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told CBS' \\"Face the Nation\\" that authorities found an arsenal of homemade explosives after Friday's gun battle between police and the two suspects.      \\"We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at that scene _ the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had _ that they were going to attack other individuals,\\" Davis said. \\"That's my belief at this point.\\"      The scene of the gun battle was loaded with unexploded bombs, and authorities had to alert arriving officers to them and clear the scene, Davis said. One improvised explosive device was found in the Mercedes the brothers are accused of carjacking, he said.      \\"This was as dangerous as it gets in urban policing,\\" Davis said.      U.S. officials said the elite interrogation team would question Tsarnaev, a Massachusetts college student, without reading him his Miranda rights, which guarantees the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Such an exception is allowed on a limited basis when the public may be in immediate danger, such as instances in which bombs are planted and ready to go off.      American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said the legal exception applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is \\"not an open-ended exception\\" to the Miranda rule.      The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it has agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, said he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are \\"serious issues regarding possible interrogation.\\"      But Republican Rep. Mike Rogers told NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" that he's not worried that the government has decided against reading the suspect his rights. Rogers said FBI agents need to know whether there are other bombs more than they need to use in court what the suspect might tell them.      Rogers, a former FBI agent, said there is so much evidence against the suspect that a conviction should be easy.      Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Sunday that surveillance video from Monday's Boston Marathon attack shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dropping his backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside it exploded.      \\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\\" Patrick told NBC television. \\"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\\"      He added, however, that he hasn't viewed all the tapes but had been briefed by law enforcement about them.      President Barack Obama said there are many unanswered questions about the bombing, including whether the Tsarnaev brothers - ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who had been in the U.S. for about a decade and lived in the Boston area - had help from others. The president urged people not to rush judgment about their motivations.      Speaking on \\"Face the Nation,\\" Patrick said that he has no idea what motivated the suspects. The governor said it's hard to imagine why someone would deliberately harm \\"innocent men, women and children in the way that these two fellows did.\\"      Patrick also said law enforcers believe the immediate threat ended when police killed one suspect and captured the other.      Patrick said Saturday afternoon that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was in serious but stable condition and was probably unable to communicate. Tsarnaev was at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where 11 victims of the bombing were still being treated.      On Sunday, family and friends attended a wake at a funeral home in Medford, Massachusetts, for Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant worker, who was one one of the three people killed in the marathon bombing. A private funeral is scheduled for Monday.      Eight-year-old Martin Richard of Boston's Dorchester neighborhood and 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a Boston University graduate student from China, also died in the attacks. BU is holding a memorial service for Lu on Monday.      On Sunday, a Boston synagogue opened its doors to worshippers from Trinity Church, which sits in the shadow of the Marathon finish line and remains closed. An interfaith service will also be held Sunday near the finish line where people set up a make-shift memorial as police cleared away debris from the bombing. The Rev. Nancy Taylor of the Old South Church said worshippers will be showing solidarity with the bombing victims.      Cardinal Sean O'Malley was offering a Mass to pray for those killed and injured in the attack and manhunt for the suspects. The service will also honor police, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and doctors who saved lives.      The all-day manhunt Friday brought the Boston area to a near standstill and put people on edge across the metropolitan area.      The break came around nightfall when a homeowner in Watertown saw blood on his boat, pulled back the tarp and saw a bloody Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside, police said. After an exchange of gunfire, he was seized and taken away in an ambulance.      Raucous celebrations erupted in and around Boston, with chants of \\"USA! USA!\\" Residents flooded the streets in relief four days after the two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and other shrapnel went off.      During the long night of violence leading up to the capture, the Tsarnaev brothers killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, severely wounded another lawman and took part in a furious shootout and car chase in which they hurled homemade explosives at police, authorities said.      Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau said one of the explosives was the same type used during Monday's Boston Marathon attack, and authorities later recovered a pressure cooker lid that had embedded in a car down the street. He said the suspects also tossed two grenades before Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition and police tackled him.      But while handcuffing him, officers had to dive out of the way as Dzhokhar drove the carjacked Mercedes at them, Deveau said. The sport utility vehicle dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. Police initially tracked the escaped suspect by a blood trail he left behind a house after he abandoned the Mercedes, negotiating his surrender hours later.      The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is tracing the weapons to try to determine how they were obtained by the suspects.      Chechnya, where the Tsarnaev family has roots, has been the scene of two wars between Russian forces and separatists since 1994. That spawned an Islamic insurgency that has carried out deadly bombings in Russia and the region, although not in the West.      Investigators have not offered a motive for the Boston attack. But in interviews with officials and those who knew the Tsarnaevs, a picture has emerged of the older one as someone embittered toward the U.S., increasingly vehement in his Muslim faith and influential over his younger brother.      The Russian FSB intelligence service told the FBI in 2011 about information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, two law enforcement officials said Saturday.      According to an FBI news release, a foreign government said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared to be a strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the U.S. for travel to a region in Russia to join unspecified underground groups.      The FBI did not name the foreign government, but the two officials said it was Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the matter publicly.      The FBI said that in response, its agents interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and relatives, and did not find any domestic or foreign terrorism activity. The bureau said it looked into such things as his telephone and online activity, his travels and his associations with others.      An uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers said he had a falling-out with Tamerlan over the man's increased commitment to Islam.      Ruslan Tsarni from Maryland said Tamerlan told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen \\"God's business\\" over work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam.      Tsarni said his relationship with his nephew basically ended after that call.      As for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, \\"he's been absolutely wasted by his older brother. I mean, he used him. He used him for whatever he's done,\\" Tsarni said.      Albrecht Ammon, a downstairs-apartment neighbor of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in Cambridge, said in an interview that the older brother had strong political views about the United States. Ammon quoted Tsarnaev as saying that the U.S. uses the Bible as \\"an excuse for invading other countries.\\"      Tamerlan Tsarnaev studied accounting as a part-time student at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston for three semesters from 2006 to 2008, the school said. He was married with a young daughter.      Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. The college was evacuated Friday, but officials said residence and dining halls will reopen Sunday.      As of Saturday, more than 50 victims of the bombing remained hospitalized, three in critical condition.      ___      Associated Press writers Bridget Murphy , Katie Zezima, Denise Lavoie and Steve Peoples in Boston; Mike Hill in Watertown, Massachusetts; Colleen Long in New York; Pete Yost in Washington; Eric Tucker in Montgomery Village, Maryland; and AP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen in Boston contributed to this report. ||||| Boston Mayor Thomas Menino lashed out on Sunday at the Tsarnaev brothers for the marathon bombings that killed three an wounded scores more.      \\"I hope that the U.S. attorney, Carmen Ortiz, takes them on the federal side and throws the book at them,\\" he said on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" \\"These two individuals held the city hostage for five days.\\"      Menino revealed that the investigation so far has not turned up any additional suspects.      \\"All the information I have is they acted alone,\\" he said.

Peter King blasted the FBI on Sunday for failing to prevent the Tsarnaev brothers from carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings when the agency had already been told about the older brother's extremist potential.      \\"This is at least the fifth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\\" the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\"      King, a Republican from New York, ticked off cases such as Anwar al-Awlaki, who planned terrorist attacks as part of al Qaeda; Carlos Bledsoe, who opened fire in in front of a military recruiting office in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009; and Nidal Malik Hasan, who opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.      \\"This is the latest in a series of cases like this...where the FBI is given information about someone as being a potential terrorist,\\" King said. \\"They look at them, and then they don’t take action, and then they go out and commit murders.\\"      The FBI questioned Tamerlan Tsarnaev about two years ago on the request of the Russian government, but concluded he was not a threat.      King said Tsarnaev should have been flagged and monitored at the least.      \\"He has statements up on his web site, he’s talking about radical imams,\\" he said.      King said law enforcement needs to focus more intently on the Muslim community, where the terror threat is emanating from, even though 99 percent of Muslims are law-abiding, good people.      \\"If you know a threat is coming from a certain community, you have to go after that,\\" he said.

Bush, said the FBI has done a good job of ensnaring potential terrorists by setting them up -- \\"pretending to be Al Qaeda\\" -- and then going after them for plotting attacks before they can carry them out. But Clarke said the events in Boston provided a dangerous example for \\"self-radicalized\\" extremists who may have previously thought carrying out such an act was too difficult to attempt.      While the FBI has been criticized for failing to stop the Tsarnaev brothers despite being warned by Russia of the older brother's potential extremism, Clarke wants to know what the Russian government did with the information. The older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spent six months in Russia last year.      \\"What I want to know is what did the Russians do when he went back to Russia?\\" Clarke said. \\"What did they do, did they follow him around?\\"      Read more about: Richard Clarke, Boston Marathon, Tamerlan Tsarnaev |||||Summary:","output":"Senator Lindsey Graham stated that the inability to track Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is either a failure of the FBI or of U.S. laws.

His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter.

U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? Options:  A. Because he wanted to win, with no other reason  B. Because Democrats were insulting Trump  C. not enough information  D. Because opinion polls said they had an edge The answer to this question is:","output":"D. Because opinion polls said they had an edge In the context provided, President Donald Trump asked his supporters not to pay attention to the Democrats who insisted they had the House all but won in November. This is due to opinion polls that gave Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November. Trump aimed to motivate his supporters to be proactive, fight for their cause, and not be complacent. He emphasized the need to go out and vote, as well as expressing optimism about Republicans' chances in both the House and Senate, especially given the strong economy at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The Admiral Graf Spee, a German heavy cruiser, took refuge in the neutral country of Uruguay after its epic battle with British warships during World War II. This specific encounter is known as the Battle of the River Plate which took place on December 13, 1939, and was the first major naval battle of the war. To provide some context, the Admiral Graf Spee, commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff, was operating in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean prior to the battle as a commerce raider, aiming to disrupt the vital trade routes of the British Empire. In response to the Admiral Graf Spee's activities, the British Royal Navy's Force G, comprising three cruisers – the HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, and HMNZS Achilles, led by Commodore Henry Harwood – was tasked with hunting down the German heavy cruiser. On December 13, 1939, the two forces discovered each other off the coast of South America, near the estuary of the River Plate which lies between Argentina and Uruguay. The ensuing battle saw both sides sustaining significant damage, with the Admiral Graf Spee eventually breaking off from the engagement to head for the nearest neutral port to carry out much-needed repairs. The chosen port was Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. Upon arriving at Montevideo, Captain Langsdorff requested permission from the Uruguayan authorities to remain there for a period of two weeks in order to repair the extensive damage sustained by the Graf Spee during the battle. However, according to international law governing neutral countries during wartime, belligerent warships were allowed a maximum stay of 72 hours in a neutral port. This forced Langsdorff to make a difficult decision. Meanwhile, the British used deception and misinformation tactics by broadcasting false reports of the arrival of more powerful British warships in the area to create a sense of urgency to leave the port as well as to overwhelm the German captain with the perceived threat. Faced with the prospect of going up against superior British forces or becoming interned in a neutral country, Captain Langsdorff decided to take the Graf Spee out of Montevideo and made the fateful decision to scuttle the ship in the River Plate estuary on December 17, 1939, to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Langsdorff and the crew sought asylum in Argentina, where the captain eventually took his own life. In conclusion, after the epic Battle of the River Plate, the German heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in Montevideo, Uruguay. The combination of international maritime law, British intelligence efforts, and the captain's subsequent decision to scuttle the ship made this incident a significant early event in World War II's naval history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Breaking down the phrase: The first step in translating any text is to understand its structure and components. The phrase \\"As simple as creating the accounts you need and move money between them!\\" can be broken down into the following main components: \\"As simple as\\", \\"creating the accounts\\", \\"you need\\", \\"and\\", \\"move money\\", \\"between them\\". 2. Translating each component: Now that we have the components, we need to translate each of them to Russian.         - \\"As simple as\\" can be translated as \\"Так же просто, как\\"    - \\"creating the accounts\\" can be translated as \\"создание учетных записей\\"    - \\"you need\\" can be translated as \\"вам нужно\\"    - \\"and\\" can be translated as \\"и\\"    - \\"move money\\" can be translated as \\"перемещать деньги\\"    - \\"between them\\" can be translated as \\"между ними\\" 3. Forming the translated sentence: Now that we have all components in Russian, we can form the complete sentence. Here we also pay attention to any grammatical adjustments required for the sentence to make sense in Russian. The sentence would sound like: \\"Так же просто, как создать учетные записи, которые вам нужны, и перемещать деньги между ними!\\"  This is the literal translation of the sentence. It would also make sense to a Russian speaker and conveys the same idea as the English sentence. So, the phrase \\"As simple as creating the accounts you need and move money between them!\\" translates to \\"Так же просто, как создать учетные записи, которые вам нужны, и перемещать деньги между ними!\\" in Russian."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the Bears now trailed the Packers in the all-time series, they were the five-point favorite against Green Bay among bookkeepers for the first time since week sixteen of 2008. The odds had been influenced by Aaron Rodgers' season-ending collarbone injury in October along with backup quarterback Brett Hundley's struggles in the previous week's 30-17 loss to the Lions. Although the Bears had not defeated the Packers at home since 2010, the Packers were 2-3 since the two teams' last meeting in week four, while Green Bay head coach Mike McCarthy was 1-3 against the Bears without Rodgers. Jeff Joniak described his ideal Bears offensive gameplan as \\"laying a clean game\\" to avoid swinging the \\"tempo or momentum in favor of a team that's on a three-game losing streak.\\" To do this, Mitchell Trubisky would have to avoid getting sacked, while the running game would have to reduce its runs resulting in negative yardage. Through the air, the Bears remained an unknown entity due to a lack of available film on Trubisky and receivers Markus Wheaton and Dontrelle Inman, the latter making his Bears debut in week ten after being traded to the team in late October. On defense, Joniak wrote the unit needed to prevent Hundley from developing his accuracy, especially as the Chicago defense was excelling in preventing touchdowns, along with containing running back Ty Montgomery, who recorded 162 rushing yards on 16 carries against the Bears in week sixteen last year. In a game that ChicagoBears.com writer Larry Mayer described as having \\" to an early-season trend, the Bears shot themselves in the foot repeatedly,\\" Chicago struggled with penalties during the game as the team committed seven in the first half. The Bears punted on the first drive, which led to an exchanging of field goals on Mason Crosby's 40- and Connor Barth's 45-yard kicks. Three drives later, in the second quarter, Montgomery scored on a 37-yard touchdown run to give the Packers the lead. On the next drive, Trubisky threw a screen pass to Benny Cunningham, who ran to the Packers' goal line and dived for the pylon. His knee landed out of bounds and the play was ruled as such at the two-yard line, which the Bears challenged with the belief that the ball had reached the pylon before he went out; instead, the challenge went against the Bears when it was determined he had lost the ball before it had touched the pylon, resulting in a touchback and possession being granted to the Packers. Chicago eventually added three more points on Barth's 44-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Crosby kicked a 24-yard field goal on the first drive of the second half, which was followed by one from 50 yards in the fourth quarter. The Bears ended their touchdown-scoring troubles (scoring just one touchdown in 35 drives across the previous four games) when Trubisky threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy, who escaped Davon House for the score. However, the Packers responded with a 75-yard drive that ended with Hundley's 19-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams. Barth added a 49-yard field goal to draw the Bears within a touchdown, and remained in contention when Crosby missed a 35-yarder wide right with 1:02 left in the game. After completing an 11-yard pass to Kendall Wright, Trubisky's next three passes were incomplete. On fourth-and-ten, Trubisky passed to Cunningham for five yards, who lateraled to Hroniss Grasu and ran two yards before he was tackled for a turnover on downs.

The discussion revolves around the players' performance, the coaches' strategies, and the game's overall progression. Despite odds in the Bears' favor due to the absence of Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers due to injury, the Packers manage to maintain a lead throughout the match, leveraging the Bears' instances of poor performance and penalties to secure their position.

The acting by the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have won an Oscar compared to those two. This movie was filled with what I guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these laugh-out-loud moments I would have given this film 2/10. What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the 80s classics?

What did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job? Why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him?

(A). negative  (B). positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is (A). negative. The reviewer starts by mentioning their disappointment in the low budget movie and the expectation of much more from an Alex Cox film. They criticize the acting of the two leading men, especially the white guy, which shows their dissatisfaction with the performances in the movie. However, they do compliment the girl's acting, saying she should have won an Oscar compared to the other two. Despite being filled with inside jokes for the film industry people and some parts that made the reviewer laugh out loud, these moments seem to be insufficient to warrant positive sentiment. The questions that the reviewer had after the movie was over also contribute to the negative sentiment, as it implies that certain aspects of the plot were poorly explained or confusing. Furthermore, their reluctance to go to the Q&A after the movie due to the inconvenient timing is another point to consider when determining the overall sentiment of the review. In summary, the negative sentiment is evident in the review through the criticism of acting, disappointment in the film's execution, and confusion regarding the plot.

The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous.  Which city experienced less damage from rainfall?  Hint: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.

The family of the Boston bombing suspects has received more than 100,000 in welfare benefits over the last decade, according to the Boston Herald. Details of the benefits - which included cash, food stamps and housing assistance - are contained within more than 500 documents that were handed over from Massachusetts welfare officials to a committee of state lawmakers on Monday. The documents have not been released publicly, but a person who has reviewed them told the Herald that the 'breadth of the benefits the family was receiving was stunning.' In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter. Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S. The Herald also spoke to. Massachusetts Rep. David Linsky about the documents, who promised a. thorough review of the assistance that the family received. 'I can assure members of the public. that this committee will actively review every single piece of. information we can find because clearly the public has a substantial. right to know what benefits, if any, this family or individuals accused. of some horrific crimes were receiving,' said Linsky, the committeeâ€™s. chairman. It has been previously reported that deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents. Last Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012. The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid. First born: Tamerlan and Katherine's daughter Zahara, pictured this week with her grandmother Judith Russell in Rhode Island, is believed to have been born in 2011. In addition to food stamps, the young. family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with. Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent. children. TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account. The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid. Food Stamps:. Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps. Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps. Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps. Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC):. Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money. Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money. Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money. While. the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native. would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while. her unemployed husband stayed at home. Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012. Welfare officials have been forced to. divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the. bombing suspects. Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval told state agencies last week that they should not discuss the details of what. government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns. Welfare information is not. available for public release unless the person in question provides their. consent, but it is available to lawmakers. Massachusetts State. Rep. David Linsky called on the state's Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information. Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials,. giving them 24 hours to provide the information. The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald. 'My office is working to fully comply with your request,'  DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.' In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011. Breadwinner: Lawyers for Katherine Russell (pictured in high school yearbook photos) said the 24-year-old mother worked tirelessly as a home healthcare aid to support her young family. Her husband was unemployed. Since the. Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid. But the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for. the public assistance. 'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to. receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum. status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including. household income levels, presence of dependent children and other. factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter. addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and. Oversight Committee. The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very. much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad. His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial. Family: Zubeidat Tsarnaev, center with Tamerlan, and the child's father, Anzor, left, received state aid multiple times from 2002 to 2011 (pictured with an uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (right) in an undated photo) Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at. University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a. scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the. Boston Globe. Investigators are scrutinizing the. brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received. outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or. foreign government. Security experts have noted though. that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the. materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston. Marathon attack could have cost a total of 100 each. Tamerlan, 26,. died early on. April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His. 19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive. manhunt. Highlights:","output":"1.

Natalie Usher told BBC Radio Scotland the delays were due to the complications of working with the private sector. The plan being considered is for a studio in Cumbernauld, close to the site used by the TV series Outlander. Talks on the project are ongoing. Ms Usher, a member of the Film Studio Delivery Group, was set up three years ago, said: \\"We want a private sector led studio and we are committed to deliver that for Scotland. It is essential. \\"It is notoriously difficult to make a studio work. We are committed to delivering it but it's not easy.\\" Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise have been in talks with a private developer since last year. In the meantime, a second proposal - entirely privately funded - has been submitted. Pentland Studios Ltd want to build a combined Film Studio and backlot on a 50-acre site at Straiton, Midlothian. But Midlothian Council has so far failed to give planning permission, and the company has asked the Scottish government to call it in for further inquiry. Ms Usher said Creative Scotland was happy to support the project - as well as developing a public studio option. \\"We are open to other proposals - not just one thing,\\" she said. \\"Pentlands is a mixed-use facility. It's a fantastic proposition which we would be happy to see happen.\\" But those who work in the industry believe Scotland is in danger of missing out to other more pro-active areas of the UK. Mandy Sykes who has worked as an actress and a director said: \\"The backers aren't going to be around for ever. \\"This low ambition, 'make do and mend' attitude is not going to work. We need to raise the ceiling in Scotland or we will never have a film industry which supplies and supports and creates wealth for our workers.\\" She's one of thousands who've signed a petition supporting the Pentlands Studio, but she believes it doesn't rule out a public studio as well. \\"There's room for both. This would start a system of studios but it's important to do something now. It's there to go. It just needs planning permission,\\" she said. \\"We're losing business at the moment. There were six feature films that filmed here in 2011 - and they all went back to London to do their studio work. So we got 0.6 % of the UK share. We are losing out on that money which would filter down to indigenous films and local crews.\\" Assistant director Tommy Gormley agrees. Earlier this week, he wrote an open letter to Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise to say he thought any further delay in building a studio would be \\"catastrophic\\" for the industry. \\"At the moment the UK tax advantage for film making is extremely attractive,\\" he said. \\"Film making is an amazing fusion of industry and art and that industrial process brings a lot of work, a lot of jobs and we're missing out on that. \\"Ten years ago, the Northern Ireland industry was nowhere and now they're massively overtaking us. The studios in Northern Ireland and Wales are not a drain on resources. They are bringing money to those countries.\\" He added: \\"I'm not asking for a publicly financed studio. It could be private. It could be public. It could be either/or but the lack of ambition from the people in charge, I find quite staggering.\\" He also warned of a talent drain. \\"Scotland is not a backwater, never has been, but we are gradually losing our crew base. I was on the set of Wonder Woman yesterday and I counted nine highly skilled Scottish technicians in London because nothing was happening in their home country. \\"Scotland has the personnel available but they're gradually being leeched away because there's nothing happening and the spend is so low.\\" But not everyone agrees that a public film studio is a wise investment. Michael Caton Jones, director of Rob Roy and Memphis Belle, whose latest film Urban Hymn had its UK premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival this weekend, is not convinced. \\"I think it's a red herring,\\" to be honest, he said. \\"It would be useful to someone who owns a studio. Will it make a business? I'm not so sure, just an aspect of the business. \\"Film follows money is the tenet. In my time, I have seen the Irish film industry become popular because of tax credits, the Australian, Czech, Hungarian. All of these places made it financially attractive and viable.\\" He added: \\"A studio is four walls. It needs to be fed. It doesn't make an industry. When I made Rob Roy we simply needed a big building. \\"We ended up using a distillery warehouse in Fort William and a shed in Perth. It didn't stop us coming because what we wanted was the exteriors and that's what's unique to Scotland.

Given the following context:  The industrial complex covers about 100 acres (40 ha) on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a heavy equipment training school at Piper, which is still in operation.In 1992 the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections opened the Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp at Piper as the state's \\"first military-style motivational boot camp\\".

The rationale to choose \\"religion\\" as the answer to your question is based on several reasons: 1. Purpose of mission work: The primary objective of mission workers is to propagate and communicate their religious beliefs and values to others. They strive to introduce people to their specific religious practices and teachings in an effort to expand their faith community. 2. Religious teachings: Mission workers discuss various aspects of their faith, including its history, core beliefs, moral values, and spiritual practices. They share their knowledge and experiences in an effort to guide others on their own spiritual journey and encourage them to embrace their religion. 3. Social and humanitarian work: In addition to spreading their religious beliefs, mission workers often engage in various social and humanitarian activities, such as providing education, medical assistance, and resource development. While these efforts are primarily aimed at improving the overall quality of life for those in need, they also serve as means to demonstrate and promote their faith's values and principles. 4. Personal experiences and testimonials: Mission workers also share their own personal religious experiences, as well as the impact their faith has had on their lives. By offering these testimonials, they aim to inspire and encourage others to explore their religion and potentially adopt it as their own. Based on these factors, it can be concluded that mission workers are constantly telling many people about \\"religion.\\" While mission work might sometimes involve discussions about other topics, such as the importance of learning or the consequences of immoral behavior (such as hellfire), the central focus of their message is, ultimately, about their religious beliefs and practices."},{"instruction":"Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   If a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a column .

Brian Schweitzer said Saturday morning that he will not run for Montana's open U.S. Senate seat in 2014, an announcement that complicates Democratic efforts to retain their majority in next year's elections.      FILE - This Aug. 30, 2012, file photo, shows Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer in Helena, Mont. Gov. Schweitzer says he will not run for Montana's open U.S. Senate seat in 2014. (AP Photo/Matt Gouras, File) (Associated Press)      Schweitzer told The Associated Press that he doesn't want to leave Montana and go to Washington, D.C.      He had been considered the Democrats best candidate for holding onto the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Max Baucus next year. Schweitzer said he felt compelled to consider the race only because many in his party said they needed him to run.      \\"I love Montana. I want to be here. There are all kinds of people that think I ought to be in the United States Senate,\\" Schweitzer said. \\"I never wanted to be in the United States Senate. I kicked the tires. I walked to the edge and looked over.\\"      But ultimately, he said, \\"people need to know I am not running for the United States Senate.\\"      The former governor was recently elected board chairman of Stillwater Mining Co., Montana's largest publicly trading company and said he is enjoying his life.      \\"I have responsibilities here in Montana, my family first. I have taken on a new life at the Stillwater mine. I owe it to the 1,670 people who work at the Stillwater mine that we continue to manage it and make it the best place to work in Montana,\\" Schweitzer said. \\"This is my home, not Washington, D.C.\\"      Schweitzer said recent criticism over politically active nonprofits connected to him had no bearing on the decision and said such criticism isn't new.      \\"This isn't my first rodeo,\\" Schweitzer said.      Montana's open Senate seat is one of several being targeted by Republicans who hope to regain Senate control in the 2014 elections. Republicans need to pick up six seats to win back the majority and enjoy several advantages: the GOP is defending fewer incumbents than Democrats and could benefit from the fact that the party controlling the White House usually loses seats during the midterm election of a second-term president.      Democrats need to defend 21 seats, including seven in largely rural states that Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012. Republicans hope to unseat four key incumbents: Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.      The brash, jeans-wearing Schweitzer last year told the AP: \\"I am not goofy enough to be in the House, and I'm not senile enough to be in the Senate.\\"      The 57-year-old Democrat left office in January after eight years in office with high approval ratings, but he wasn't able to run again because of term limits. The unconventional governor, who easily won re-election in 2008, always displayed a feel for tapping into Montana's conservative-leaning yet libertarian politics.      In Helena, his heavy-handed style proved adept at largely getting his way with the state budget despite fostering a confrontational and sour relationship with majority Republicans. He often touted the state's surpluses at a time when many others were floundering.      The outspoken governor never missed an opportunity to leave a larger-than-life impression. He once stormed New York's Times Square with a bullhorn handing out Montana-made promotional trinkets from a semi-truck.      But Schweitzer said he is enjoying pursuits other than politics, with a new lake house and a small ranch in the mountains.      \\"I don't want a job where I have to wear a suit, and my dog isn't welcome,\\" he said.      Other Democrats who expressed an interest in running, including State Auditor Monica Lindeen and schools Superintendent Denise Juneau, had been waiting on Schweitzer's decision.      The announcement surprised a Democratic Party that was meeting Saturday in Lewistown for its annual convention, and attention quickly turned to other potential candidates.      \\"Democrats were ready to get behind him in a bid for U.S. Senate,\\" said Juneau. \\"Since his announcement, I have been receiving encouragement to run, and I plan to give careful thought to that decision.\\"      State Sen. Kendall Van Dyk of Billings, said he understood the decision to spurn a dysfunctional Congress. \\"He chose Montana trout over the rattlesnakes,\\" Van Dyk said.      However, he added, Schweitzer \\"has done tremendous things for the state, and any Democrat will tell you he has done tremendous things for the party. Montana needs Brian Schweitzer. And I believe this isn't the last we have heard of him.\\"      Republicans are hopeful that freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines will run for the open seat. Some Republicans are also advocating former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who served from 1993 to 2001 and later chaired the Republican National Committee.      Daines said Saturday that he will continue to consider the race.      \\"My focus is fixed on serving the people of Montana and doing the job they sent me to do,\\" he said in a statement. \\"I will continue to give this decision the consideration it deserves, and am still taking time to talk with my family and the people of Montana about how I can best be of service to our state.\\"      As Schweitzer was mulling his options, the Montana Republican Party circulated a 2010 Internal Revenue Service form that showed a politically active nonprofit group called The Council for a Sustainable America used the same Helena post office box used for Schweitzer's 2008 re-election campaign and was signed by David Gallik, the state commissioner of political practices appointed by Schweitzer at the time.      The Council for a Sustainable America spent about 60,000 on politics in 2010, but it did not say in which races.      Schweitzer adviser Franklin Hall said at the time the nonprofit was never used for Montana politics or to aid Schweitzer.      Baucus, 71, announced in April that he was retiring. He was elected to the Senate in 1978 after serving two terms in the House. Baucus, who still controls a healthy campaign war chest, promised Democrats on Saturday he will continue helping them with 2014 elections.      \\"Brian was a great governor and there's no question he would have made an excellent candidate,\\" Baucus said in a statement. \\"But we still have a wide field of qualified Montana Democrats who can run and win this seat.\\" ||||| Former Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer’s surprise announcement Saturday that he won’t run for Senate in Montana imperils Democrats’ chances of holding the seat and could further narrow an ever-shrinking 2014 Senate map.      Already, Republicans are favored to win two seats left vacant by Democratic retirements — in West Virginia and South Dakota — and the Schweitzer move will make it much easier for the GOP to win in Montana.      Text Size -      +      reset      That means the battle for the majority will likely be fought in a handful of red states with Democratic incumbents, including North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska.      (PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)      To capture the net six seats it needs to take back the majority in 2014, the GOP will also have to successfully defend Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and avoid a bloody primary in Georgia that could give Democrats an opening in the red state.      Schweitzer roiled the Senate landscape when he told the Associated Press Saturday that he wants to stay in Montana rather than move to Washington, D.C. But his potential candidacy was also raising red flags within the party: After weeks of courting the 57-year-old Schweitzer, Democratic leaders reversed course in recent days.      Scrutinizing Schweitzer’s past, they concluded there was too much ammunition for Republicans to use against him in the campaign to replace the retiring veteran Democrat Max Baucus, according to a source familiar with the thinking of those leaders.      Polls had shown the gregarious and folksy ex-governor as a favorite in the race, given his popularity after two terms in office. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had said as recently as Wednesday there would be “tremendous support” for Schweitzer if he decided to run.      Schweitzer had been hit with a series of damaging stories about his ties to “secret money” and a nonprofit group run by former aides. But sources said the laundry list of opposition research went much deeper — and could have crippled a Schweitzer campaign for Senate. Moreover, there was fear that Schweitzer’s penchant for off-the-cuff remarks would hurt his ability to respond effectively to the barrage of GOP attacks.      Schweitzer ended a long Republican run of control of the governor’s office when he was first elected in 2004. But he frequently sparred with fellow top Democrats in the state, including Baucus and Sen. Jon Tester. Unease within the party about Schweitzer’s presumed candidacy had begun to surface in recent days.      Still, Schweitzer would have very formidable, forcing both parties to spend millions in what could have been a closely contested fight.      In Montana, Democrats said Saturday they still had a chance and there were other possible Democratic candidates who could give Republicans a serious run. Those potential Democratic candidates include Denise Juneau, Montana’s state public schools superintendent; Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List; and Monica Lindeen, Montana insurance commissioner.      “Running for the U.S. Senate is a big decision for a potential candidate and their family. Just because this year wasn’t the right time for Brian to run doesn’t mean we don’t have great Montana Democrats who are willing to run and capable of winning the seat,” Tester said in a statement.      And Republicans could have their own tough primary in Montana. It remains to be seen how the Republican primary shapes up — and whether Rep. Steve Daines decides to jump in against former state Sen. Corey Stapleton and state Rep. Champ Edmunds.      Nevertheless, Schweitzer’s move is expected to stun the Democratic political establishment — particular in Montana, where the party was gathering this weekend for the state convention in Lewistown, Mont. His decision will also disappoint the left, which embraced the populist governor when he backed a liberal health care overhaul plan in 2009 as Baucus played dealmaker in the Senate.      And his decision to forgo the campaign will leave Democrats without their biggest name — and personality — in the race.      “We remain confident that Democrats can hold the Montana seat and the overall math still favors Democrats next year,” Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “Only three Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in the last decade. Our incumbents are positioned to win, we’ve already recruited a strong challenger to Mitch McConnell and Republicans have failed to expand the senate map into blue and purple states.”      Republicans, of course, had a different take.      “Just two days ago, Senate Democrats were quoted promising Brian Schweitzer tremendous resources to get in the race,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring. “We did our homework and there was a lot of rust under Schweitzer’s hood, but just as important is that he looked at the race and realized he wouldn’t win in light of how unpopular the Democrat agenda of higher taxes, bankrupting spending, and the Obamacare train wreck is in Montana these days.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Former Montana Governor, Brian Schweitzer, has decided not to run for the U.S. Sentae seat left vacant by retiring senator Max Baucus in the 2014 elections. This announcement complicates the Democratic Party's efforts to retain their majority in the Senate.

Instead, Schweitzer will focus on his responsibilities as the newly elected board chairman of the Stillwater Mining Co., Montana's largest publicly traded company.

Steve Daines and former Governor Marc Racicot from the Republican side, possible Democratic candidates might include Montana’s state public schools superintendent Denise Juneau, and Montana insurance commissioner Monica Lindeen. Despite political setbacks related to Schweitzer, Democrats are still hopeful about the race, while Republicans see this decision as an advantage towards gaining control of the Senate."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Let us analyze both sentences in more detail to elaborate on this point. The original sentence provides the following information: 1. There is a man wearing a plaid suit. 2. This man is playing guitar. 3. He is playing with a woman and another man (most likely implying some form of a musical collaboration). However, it does not provide any information about the relationships between these individuals or the nature of the song being played. We do not know if the individuals mentioned are friends or strangers, or whether the song played is one that the man in the plaid suit wrote himself or not. The second sentence claims that: 1. A man is playing a song. 2. He wrote the song himself. 3. He wrote it specifically for his friends. Although it is possible that the man in the plaid suit in the original sentence could be playing a song he wrote for his friends, there is no concrete information provided to confirm this. The second sentence introduces new elements that are not explicitly present in the original sentence, such as who the song was written by and what the relationship is between the people involved. In conclusion, we cannot definitively say that the sentence \\"A man is playing a song he wrote for his friends\\" is true based solely on the information provided by the original sentence. Further details about the relationships between the individuals and the origins of the song would be required to make that determination."},{"instruction":"Question: Mrs Brown goes to see her son in London .

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try...

A double album is usually though not always released as such, because the recording is longer than the capacity of the medium. Recording artists often think of double albums as comprising a single piece artistically; however, there are exceptions such as John Lennon's \\"Some Time in New York City\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Ummagumma\\" (both examples of one studio record and one live album packaged together) and OutKast's \\"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\\" (effectively two solo albums, one by each member of the duo). A classic example of this idea is Works (Volume One) by Emerson Lake and Palmer, where side one was Keith Emerson, two Greg Lake, three Carl Palmer while side four was by the entire group.  - Stop the Clocks is a compilation album by the English rock band Oasis, released on 20 November 2006. The \\"retrospective collection\\" is an 18-track double album with the featured songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not actually include their song \\"Stop the Clocks\\" after which the album is named. It went 5× Platinum in the United Kingdom, with sales better than any Oasis release since \\"Be Here Now\\".  - Noel Thomas David Gallagher (born 29 May 1967) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist. He served as the lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist and principal songwriter of the rock band Oasis. Raised in Burnage, Manchester, Gallagher began learning guitar at the age of thirteen. After a series of odd jobs in construction, he worked for local Manchester band Inspiral Carpets as a roadie and technician in 1988. Whilst touring with them, he learned that his brother Liam Gallagher had formed a band of his own, known as The Rain, which eventually took on the name Oasis. After Gallagher returned to England, he was invited by his brother to join Oasis as songwriter and guitarist.  - The Masterplan is a compilation album by the English rock band Oasis , comprising B - sides which never made it onto an album . The album was originally intended for release only in areas such as the United States and Japan , where the tracks were only available on expensive European import singles . It was first released in late 1998 . The Masterplan reached number 2 in the UK where it went platinum , and number 51 in the United States . However , it did reach the Top 20 in various charts around the world , going on to sell two million copies . Four songs from the album appear on the 2006 compilation album Stop the Clocks .

Technicians are skilled professionals, and their work may involve fixing, assembling, or maintaining various systems.

The technicians in the given statement are indeed people, and they are involved in labor-intensive activities or work beneath the surface of the ground. So, option (1) yes is the most accurate answer. Various industries require skilled technicians to work in underground environments. Some examples are mining, tunnel construction, subway or metro transportation facilities, underground cable installation, and maintenance of sewer systems. Working underground may confront individuals with unique challenges, such as confined spaces, lack of natural sunlight, damp or hazardous conditions, or difficulties in communication and transport.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

However, upon receiving them, she found the documentation stating that the inserts should be used in conjunction with a 1,200-calorie-per-day diet.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening.

Q: Q: Blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the what system?   A: Options: 1. digestive 2. cardiovascular 3. nervous 4. endocrine The answer is:","output":"In order to find the correct answer, let us consider each option and its relation to blood calcium levels: 1. Digestive System: This system is responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, but it does not directly regulate blood calcium levels. 2. Cardiovascular System: This system's primary function is to circulate blood and transport nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. While it is essential for the distribution of calcium, it does not actively regulate blood calcium levels. 3. Nervous System: This system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body, coordinating body functions, and interpreting sensory input. Although the nervous system requires calcium for proper function, it does not directly regulate blood calcium levels. 4. Endocrine System: This system comprises glands that produce and secrete hormones, which regulate many aspects of body function, including growth, metabolism, and homeostasis. Certain hormones, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, directly regulate blood calcium levels by maintaining a balance between the bone, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.

The style of Georgian buildings is very variable, but marked by a taste for symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome, as revived in Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet .  - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.  - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant :  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.  - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:,  + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally,  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.  - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.  - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics.  - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

No; The suggested answer provided touches upon the quality of service comparison between the United States and Canada, but it does not specifically address the question regarding Canada's healthcare system. Additionally, the source of the study mentioned is not provided, making it impossible to verify the legitimacy of the data. To provide a more appropriate and detailed answer, let's focus on how Canada's healthcare system operates: Canada's healthcare system, known as Medicare, is a publicly-funded, universal healthcare system that provides its citizens with access to essential medical services by doctors, specialists, and hospitals. This system operates under the guidance of the Canada Health Act, with each province and territory administering their own healthcare plans. Canada's healthcare system is funded primarily through general tax revenue collected by both federal and provincial governments. This means that Canadian residents receive coverage for necessary medical services without having to pay out-of-pocket. However, healthcare services in Canada generally do not cover services such as dental care, prescription medications, and vision care. Many Canadians also opt to purchase additional supplementary private insurance to cover these services. One of the main goals of the Canadian healthcare system is to ensure that all citizens have universal access to care, regardless of their financial status. This is achieved through the principles of universality, comprehensiveness, portability, accessibility, and public administration. However, in terms of responsiveness or quality of service, there are some critiques of the Canadian healthcare system, including long wait times for non-emergency services and the availability of specialists. In conclusion, the suggested answer does not provide an accurate and complete description of Canada's healthcare system. Instead, it is important to delve into how the system functions, its funding, objectives, and the challenges faced in providing quality care to all citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The missing first step in this process is: \\"The adult birds engage in courtship rituals and establish a breeding territory.\\" So, the revised and complete process is as follows: 1. The adult birds engage in courtship rituals and establish a breeding territory. 2. The adult birds find mates and mate. 3. The parent(s) incubate the eggs. 4. The eggs hatch. 5. The mother (and sometimes the father) bird take care of the baby birds. 6. The baby birds grow up and get their flight feathers. 7. The young birds learn to fly and leave the nest. Throughout this process, various aspects of breeding in birds can be observed depending on the species. Courtship rituals, also known as mating displays, are performed by birds to attract a suitable mate. These elaborate behaviors include singing, dancing, and the presentation of brightly colored plumage or body parts. Once a pair has formed through successful courtship, the birds will then establish a breeding territory to ensure their offspring will have access to adequate resources for growth and development. In the next step, the mated pair proceed with copulation which leads to fertilization of the eggs. Following fertilization, the female bird will lay the eggs in their nest, which is often intricately crafted to provide the perfect environment for incubation. During the incubation period, the parent birds work together to protect and provide warmth to their eggs, ensuring a stable temperature for successful embryonic development to take place. Upon hatching, the helpless and vulnerable baby birds, also known as nestlings or hatchlings, rely entirely on their parents for warmth, protection, and nutrition. As the baby birds grow, they develop feathers necessary for insulation, camouflage, and ultimately flight. This phase, known as the fledgling stage, occurs when the young birds begin to test their wings and eventually leave the nest to become independent. Throughout the entire breeding process, various factors, such as availability of resources, predation, and environmental conditions, can influence the success rate of producing and raising offspring. Nevertheless, these seven key steps in the breeding cycle of birds are vital for the continuation of bird populations and the vital ecological services they provide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One day, Soapy Smith and I visited a shelter for badly-treated women located in a deserted section of the city. No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp   in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him. When her face was within inches of his, she carefully reached out and circled him with her arms. So softly that no one in the room could hear, she began to talk. Folded around the rabbit, she pillowed her head on his back and whispered to him. Soapy remained motionless. I looked up and noticed that the shelter workers had stopped talking. Every adult in the room froze in place. Time seemed to have stopped. The little girl reappeared when I was preparing to leave. She reached her hands out and looked me directly in the eye.

Justin wants to learn how to flip a pancake so he asks Robert for an advice, because  Choose from: a). Justin is a beginner.; b). Robert is a beginner.;","output":"a). Justin is a beginner. Justin has always loved eating pancakes but never actually tried making them from scratch. He had heard that his friend Robert make delicious pancakes, so he decided to ask him for some advice. Since Justin is a beginner at cooking, he thought Robert could give him some helpful tips. On a sunny Saturday morning, Justin called Robert and invited him to his place. \\"Hey Robert, could you come over and teach me how to flip a pancake? I really want to learn, and I heard that you are an expert at making them!\\" Robert laughed at the 'expert' title but agreed to help his friend out. When Robert arrived, he found Justin in the kitchen, apron on and ingredients neatly laid out on the counter. He was eager to learn, yet a little apprehensive about making something that required a particular skill such as flipping. Robert reassured him that it's not as hard as it looks, and they began working through the process step by step. First, they mixed the dry ingredients such as flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, they combined the wet ingredients which included milk, eggs, and melted butter. Robert advised Justin that it's best to make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and then gradually add the wet ingredients while whisking. This would ensure a smooth, lump-free batter. Once they achieved the right consistency, Robert showed Justin how to heat the non-stick pan properly. \\"Remember, a well-heated pan is essential for making perfectly flipped pancakes. If it's too cold, the batter will stick, making it difficult to flip,\\" he explained. As the pan reached the desired temperature, Robert showed Justin how to ladle the batter into the pan. He advised pouring the batter from a small height and letting it spread out evenly on its own. \\"Don't overcrowd the pan,\\" Robert warned. \\"Give the pancake space to grow.\\" Justin was growing more confident as he watched the pancake cooking on the first side. The edges were starting to firm up, and small bubbles were forming on the surface. \\"It's time for the flip!\\" exclaimed Robert with excitement. \\"Here's the part where your wrist comes into play.\\" Robert demonstrated the pancake flip to Justin. He loosened the edges of the pancake with a spatula and then, with a flick of his wrist, flipped the pancake in the air. The pancake made a graceful arc and landed perfectly back in the pan. Justin watched in awe, excited to try it for himself. Taking a deep breath, Justin attempted his first flip. The pancake went airborne, but it didn't land quite as effortlessly as Robert's. However, it was still a decent attempt for a first-timer. Justin was thrilled with his progress and asked Robert to critique his technique so he could improve. Over the next few pancakes, Justin practiced and began mastering the flip. Robert continued to provide support and pointers whenever needed. By the time they finished making the pancakes, Justin was flipping them with ease, his confidence soaring. The friends enjoyed the fruits of their labor, devouring stacks of delicious homemade pancakes topped with melted butter and maple syrup. They laughed and talked about their fun-filled morning, and Justin expressed his gratitude to Robert for teaching him a new skill. \\"Thanks, Robert! I couldn't have done it without you!\\" From that day on, Justin continued to hone his pancake-flipping skills and even dabble in variations like blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. He was no longer a beginner but a pancake enthusiast, all thanks to his friend Robert's guidance and patience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How likely is that to be threatening? I am in my pre-final year in ECE engineering. What all knowledge do I need as to have an edge during placements?","output":"No, these two questions are not the same. They address different subjects, and their focus is distinct. While the first question pertains to the environment and our understanding of climate change, the second question is career-oriented, focusing on electronic and communication engineering (ECE). Let's explore both of these questions in more detail. Question 1: \\"Climate scientists have posited the possibility of a run-away greenhouse effect. How likely is that to be threatening?\\" This question revolves around the field of environmental science, specifically focusing on the concept of a runaway greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse effect occurs when a planet absorbs more solar radiation than it can dissipate, leading to a continuous increase in temperature until an equilibrium is reached. This has been hypothesized as a possible scenario for Venus's current adverse climate conditions. The likelihood of the Earth experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect is still a subject of debate among climate scientists. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has not mentioned a runaway greenhouse effect event in their future predictions, there are concerns that amplifying feedback loops, such as the release of methane from melting permafrost, increased water vapor, and forest dieback, might accelerate climate change beyond current projections.  However, most researchers believe that we are not yet at the point where a runaway greenhouse effect is imminent. Preventing this outcome will require substantial global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and follow other mitigation strategies. The longer we delay taking action, the higher the risk of destabilizing the climate system and experiencing more severe consequences of climate change. Question 2: \\"I am in my pre-final year in ECE engineering. What all knowledge do I need to have an edge during placements?\\" This question concerns career preparation, specifically for students in the field of Electronic and Communication Engineering (ECE). ECE is a rapidly evolving field, with numerous job opportunities in industries like consumer electronics, telecommunications, aerospace, IoT, automotive, and many others. To excel in ECE and improve your chances of securing successful placements during job interviews, consider acquiring the following knowledge and skills: 1. Fundamentals: Have a solid grasp of core ECE subjects like digital electronics, analog electronics, control systems, microprocessors, signals and systems, electromagnetic theory, and communication systems. 2. Programming languages: Familiarize yourself with programming languages relevant to the ECE field, such as C, C++, Python, and VHDL/Verilog for hardware description. 3. Practical experience: Engage in hands-on projects, internships, or research to apply your theoretical knowledge practically. This demonstrates to potential employers that you are capable of working in real-world situations. 4. Software tools: Learn to use software tools that are related to ECE, such as circuit simulators (e.g., LTspice, Multisim), PCB design tools (e.g., Eagle, KiCad), and MATLAB. 5. Specialization: Focus on an area of ECE that interests you or in-demand specializations, such as embedded systems, communication networks, Internet of Things, VLSI design, robotics, or machine learning and artificial intelligence. 6. Soft skills: Develop skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, time management, and effective communication, as these are essential in any engineering field. 7. Networking: Participate in technical clubs, workshops, conferences, and professional networking platforms to build connections and stay informed about industry trends and opportunities. 8. Certifications: Pursue relevant certifications or courses that complement your ECE degree, such as those related to networking (e.g., CCNA, CCNP), programming, or other advanced technologies and platforms. By focusing on these areas, you can build a strong foundation and enhance your competitive edge during placement opportunities in the ECE field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night.

Please answer the following question: when does Plum Island Light built which has the same design as Great Captain Island Lighthouse? A:","output":"Plum Island Lighthouse, which shares the same design as Great Captain Island Lighthouse, was built in 1869.  Plum Island Lighthouse, also known as Plum Island Range Rear Light, is located on Plum Island, near the western end of Long Island Sound in New York, United States. The lighthouse was constructed as part of the lighting system established to guide mariners through Plum Gut, a narrow passage off the eastern tip of Long Island that connected to Gardiners Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The lighthouse features a cast-iron and brick tower that is 55 feet tall, octagonal in shape, and painted white to improve its visibility. This particular design was a result of efforts by the United States Lighthouse Board in the mid-19th century to standardize the construction of lighthouses by using prefabricated cast-iron components. Cast-iron structures were not only more economical but also more durable against harsh coastal weather conditions. Great Captain Island Lighthouse is located on Great Captain Island, off the coast of Greenwich, Connecticut. This lighthouse also features the same octagonal cast-iron design. Great Captain Island Lighthouse's construction was completed in 1868, just a year before Plum Island Lighthouse. Although both lighthouses were built around the same time and used similar designs, they served different purposes. While Plum Island Light helped mariners navigate through Plum Gut, Great Captain Island Lighthouse provided guidance for vessels approaching the ports of Stamford and Greenwich in Connecticut, as well as New York City. Over the years, both lighthouses underwent renovations and technology upgrades, and the structures that exist today still serve to aid navigation in their respective regions. However, while Plum Island Lighthouse was deactivated in 1978 and replaced by an automatic light on a skeleton tower, Great Captain Island Lighthouse continues to operate, having been automated in 1970.

Revolutionizing the field of communication and information dissemination, the printing press played a crucial role in shaping the modern world. This article aims to explore the origin, development, and impact of the Gutenberg printing press, shedding light on its significance in shaping human history. The Origin of the Gutenberg Printing Press Johannes Gutenberg, born in Mainz, Germany, around 1400, was a goldsmith by trade. The idea of a printing press came to him while working on a project commissioned by the Church to create multiple copies of religious texts. Recognizing the limitations of the existing method of copying texts manually by scribes, Gutenberg sought a more efficient and cost-effective alternative. His inspiration stemmed from his experience as a goldsmith, where he utilized molds and metal alloys to create various products. Development of the Printing Press Gutenberg's groundbreaking idea was to use movable type to create individual characters that could be rearranged and reused to form new words and sentences. He crafted a matrix with holes that held metal pins, corresponding to each letter of the alphabet, and used these pins to create molds in which he poured molten metal. The resulting metal type could then be assembled into words, sentences, and paragraphs on a wooden frame called a forme. Gutenberg combined his invention of movable type with a modified version of the existing screw press, which was traditionally used for pressing grapes or olives. By fitting the press with a wooden platen, he was able to apply continuous pressure on the paper and inked type, ensuring a clean and even transfer of ink to paper. This innovative adaptation allowed the efficient and precise production of multiple copies of text with ease and speed. The Printing of the Gutenberg Bible In 1455, Gutenberg's invention reached a significant milestone with the completion of the 42-line Gutenberg Bible, also known as the Mazarin Bible. This Latin Bible consisted of 1,282 pages and is considered a masterpiece of typography and craftsmanship. The Gutenberg Bible demonstrated the potential of the printing press to transform the way people accessed and shared written information. It marked a shift in the history of book production from laborious and costly handwritten texts to mass-produced and easily accessible printed works. Impact of the Gutenberg Printing Press The Gutenberg printing press's most significant impact was in revolutionizing the accessibility and dissemination of knowledge, transforming the way society functioned. Some of the key areas influenced by the invention of the printing press include: 1. Education and Literacy: As books became more affordable and widely accessible, the demand for literacy grew, leading to an increase in education across social classes. The readily available printed materials allowed for greater self-study and facilitated learning outside of formal education institutions. 2. Religion and the Reformation: The printing press made it possible to print religious texts in large quantities and in local languages. This helped to spread religious ideas, giving rise to the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. For the first time, the wider public could read, interpret and discuss religious texts for themselves, challenging the authority of the Catholic Church. 3. Scientific Revolution: The ability to easily share and reproduce scientific findings and theories allowed researchers to build upon the work of their predecessors, accelerating the growth of scientific knowledge. Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed an explosion of new ideas and inventions in various fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and physics. 4. The Birth of Mass Media: The printing press facilitated the emergence of newspapers, pamphlets, and flyers. This development allowed for greater participation by the general public in intellectual debates, political discussions, and the spread of news – giving birth to the concept of mass media and the modern communication systems we rely on today. Conclusion The invention of the Gutenberg printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s marked the beginning of a new era in human history. By revolutionizing the production and dissemination of written information, this remarkable invention played a crucial role in shaping the world's modern landscape. The Gutenberg printing press accelerated the growth of literacy, education, scientific innovation, religious reform, and mass communication – all of which continue to shape our lives today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant.

Step 3: Store the stacked plates in a safe and stable environment. Justification: A stable environment reduces the risk of accidental falls or impacts, ensuring the well-being of the antique china. 2. Protect your antique china plates or fine dinnerware from scratches by placing an inexpensive glass plate between them when storing. Step 1: Acquire inexpensive glass plates. Justification: Glass plates may not be as easily accessible as paper plates but can still be found without much difficulty. Step 2: Place a glass plate between each antique china plate or fine dinnerware.

He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideals and his greatness. Rama is one of the many deities in Hinduism and especially of the various Vaishnava sects. Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar.  - In Hindu mythology , Kunti - Bhoja ( or Kuntibhoja ) was the adoptive father and cousin of Queen Kunti .

WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising!   Are Gift Cards a Good Idea?   Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year,  2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another  I billion or so was forgotten altogether.    How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given?    The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the  more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  Which rocks are less soluble, the ones from the Ozarks, or the ones from the Rockies? Answer:","output":"To determine which rocks are less soluble between the ones from the Ozarks in Missouri and the ones from the Colorado Rockies, it's essential first to understand the geology and composition of the rocks in these mountain ranges. The Ozarks, a high plateau region also known as the Ozark Plateau, extends over parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This area is characterized mainly by the presence of limestone, dolomite, and chert, which were formed from the deposition of marine sediments during the Paleozoic Era (approximately 541 to 252 million years ago). Limestone and dolomite are composed predominantly of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate) and are hence susceptible to dissolution in the presence of weak acids, such as carbonic acid found in rainwater. This process of dissolution leads to the formation of the caves, sinkholes, and blue holes that Peter loved so much. The dissolved calcite precipitates overtime, forming speleothems like stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones in underground caverns. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies, or Rocky Mountains, is a vast and imposing mountain range that stretches about 3,000 miles from northern British Columbia in Canada to New Mexico in the United States. The Rockies are younger than the Ozarks, having formed about 80 million years ago during the Laramide Orogeny, a period of intense mountain-building activity due to the tectonic collision between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. Consequently, the rock composition of the Colorado Rockies is quite different from the Ozarks, with a dominant presence of igneous (granite and basalt) and metamorphic rocks (gneiss, schist, and marble). These rock types, especially the igneous and metamorphic ones, are typically more resistant to weathering and dissolution than the sedimentary rocks like limestone. When comparing the solubility of rocks from the Ozarks and the Colorado Rockies, the sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolomite) found in the Ozarks are more soluble due in large part to their calcite content, which reacts with weak acids present in the natural environment. In contrast, the rocks from the Colorado Rockies, primarily the igneous and metamorphic types, demonstrate reduced solubility and resistance to dissolution and weathering. In conclusion, the rocks from the Colorado Rockies are less soluble than the ones from the Ozarks, owing to their distinct geological history and resultant compositions. The Ozarks' susceptibility to dissolution results in the awe-inspiring cave systems and blue holes that Peter particularly enjoyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON (CNN) --  -- It's OK for Republicans to want President Obama to fail if they think he's jeopardizing the country, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told members of his political party Tuesday night. Gov. Bobby Jindal is offering a spirited defense of Republicans who say they want President Obama to fail. Jindal described the premise of the question -- \\"Do you want the president to fail?\\" -- as the \\"latest gotcha game\\" being perpetrated by Democrats against Republicans. \\"Make no mistake: Anything other than an immediate and compliant, 'Why no sir, I don't want the president to fail,' is treated as some sort of act of treason, civil disobedience or political obstructionism,\\" Jindal said at a political fundraiser attended by 1,200 people. \\"This is political correctness run amok.\\" At 37, OPTIONS: - Bobby Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - CNN potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Democrats potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - GOP potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Louisiana potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Obama potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Republicans potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - U.S. potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - WASHINGTON potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012.","output":"Bobby Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. As a young and prominent Republican figure, Jindal has been making waves in the political arena, gaining recognition and support among members of his party. Born in 1971 to Indian immigrant parents, Jindal has accomplished a lot in his relatively short political career. He has served in various positions, including as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and as the Governor of Louisiana from 2008 to 2016. Jindal's leadership during and after Hurricane Katrina showcased his ability to handle crisis situations and make tough decisions on behalf of his constituents. Moreover, Jindal has been an advocate for reducing the size of government and promoting conservative fiscal policies. As a potential 2012 presidential candidate, Jindal could have capitalized on his diverse background and experience in both the legislative and executive branches of government to appeal to a wide range of voters. While he ultimately decided not to run for president in 2012, his name was often mentioned in discussions about potential Republican candidates. Moving forward, Jindal's political career could continue to flourish in various ways. He could seek to return to Congress or explore opportunities at the state level in Louisiana. Additionally, Jindal could potentially be tapped for a position within the Republican administration or be considered for other leadership roles within the party. Jindal's comments defending Republicans who wish for then-President Obama to fail indicate his commitment to his party's values and his willingness to stand up for conservatism. This loyalty and dedication to the GOP will likely continue to serve him well in his future political endeavors. In summary, Bobby Jindal's early accomplishments and steadfast commitment to his party suggest that he has a long political future ahead, regardless of whether he decides to run for president in the future. His diverse background and experience in various government roles serve to strengthen his appeal and make him a valuable asset for the Republican Party. It will be interesting to see how Jindal's political career unfolds and the impact he has on both his party and the American political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake.

A conference call is a telephone call where multiple participants can simultaneously talk and listen. This type of call is typically used for business meetings, seminars, panels, and other collaborative events where a group of people need to have a real-time conversation, often from different locations. In a conference call, each participant uses either a speakerphone or headphones to connect to the call and engage with others. Modern conference calls often use video conferencing software to add a visual element to the meeting and make the interaction feel more personal and engaging. To elaborate further on the other options provided: 1. Desktop: A desktop refers to the primary screen space and the hardware setup of a computer where programs, documents, and applications are managed. While desktop computers can be used to facilitate conference calls, the term itself does not directly refer to the type of call you are on. 2. Headphones: Headphones are an audio device worn on the ears to privately listen to music or other audio content. They can be connected to various devices, such as smartphones, computers, or music players. While headphones may be used during a conference call, they do not define the type of call you are on. 3. Connect: Connect is a verb that means to join, link, or fasten together. It is not related to a specific type of call. However, the term could be associated with connecting a call or joining a conference call. 4.

Here, I will elaborate on each question and provide a detailed response for each of them. 1. How can I get my lying boss fired without me or my coworkers feeling the repercussions? To achieve this, it is important to follow a careful, systematic approach. The key is to document any incidents, gather evidence, and follow the appropriate chain of communication. Below are some steps to help you work through the situation: a. Keep a detailed record: Make notes on each incident where your boss has lied, including the date, time, people involved, and any relevant context. This documentation will serve as evidence when you present your case to higher management or HR. b. Gather evidence: If there is any physical or digital evidence, such as emails or recorded conversations, that can corroborate your claims, gather and securely store them. c. Speak with your coworkers: Talk to your coworkers to see if they have observed similar behavior from your boss. If possible, ask them to document incidents and share any evidence they may have. Assure them that their identities will be kept confidential, if they wish. d. Understand your company's policies: Familiarize yourself with your company's policies and procedures regarding workplace conduct, ethics, and reporting. This information will guide you on how to best address the issue. e. Report the issue: Follow the appropriate chain of command in your company to report the issue. Ideally, you should be reporting this to either a higher-level manager, an HR representative, or an ethics hotline if your company has one. Be clear, factual, and concise in your communication. f. Remain professional: While reporting the issue, it is important to remain professional and focused on the facts. Avoid personal attacks or making emotional appeals. This will help establish your credibility. g. Protect yourself from retaliation: If you are concerned about possible retaliation, you can request anonymity during your report. You should also familiarize yourself with your company's anti-retaliation policy and any relevant labor laws in case you need to take further action. 2. Can my boss fire me because I smell bad? In general, an employer may be able to terminate an employee due to bad hygiene or offensive odors, assuming these issues are causing disruptions in the workplace and the employer has followed due process. The specific legality of such a termination is more nuanced and depends on various factors, such as employment contracts, local labor laws, and whether the employee has been given a fair chance to improve their hygiene. Here's a more detailed breakdown: a. Check your employment contract: If your employment contract stipulates that an employee can be terminated for poor hygiene or any specific causes, your boss may have grounds to fire you. b. Research local labor laws: Research the labor laws in your area to determine the grounds for termination, ensuring you're aware of your rights and any possible legal recourse. c. Fair warning: Employers are typically expected to provide fair warning and an opportunity to rectify the issue before considering termination. If your boss has identified the problem but has not provided you with an opportunity to improve your hygiene, it could be considered unfair dismissal. d. Discrimination or harassment: Ensure that your boss's actions aren't motivated by unlawful discrimination or harassment. Termination based on personal bias or ill-will could be against the law, depending on your jurisdiction. e. Medical conditions: In some cases, bad odors may be caused by medical conditions. If your smell is caused by a medical condition, you may be protected under disability laws. In this case, termination due to the smell could be considered discriminatory and unlawful. As demonstrated, these two questions focus on different aspects of workplace dynamics and employee rights. While the first question concerns addressing dishonest behavior from a superior, the second examines whether an employee can be terminated for personal hygiene reasons."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The incinerated-looking buns are darkened with bamboo charcoal, and the same has been used to give the poisonous-looking cheese its melted-tar look. The beef burgers, meanwhile, have added black pepper, and are topped with an onion and garlic sauce mixed with squid ink.      The international chain says it is the third time it has released a goth-like burger (the others had black buns and black ketchup) and diners have so far given them a “favourable reception.”      Strange as they seem, however, Burger King’s Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond are not the first black burgers around.

It may be an extravagant claim for the purveyors of fast food, but it certainly adds a dash of danger to your burger. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rice Energy's Gas Deal Gives OPEC a Black Eye If you want to understand why OPEC is having such a hard time squeezing shale producers out of the energy market, look no further than Rice Energy's multi-dimensional, 2.7 billion acquisition of Vantage Energy. Yes, it's a natural-gas deal, not oil. But that isn't the point. The point is that a deal of this scale, requiring this much new money, for a commodity this beaten down, is getting done at all in the U.S. exploration and production sector. Gas has rallied recently, although 3 per million BTU counts as enough to get a high-five from bulls these days. 3, That's The Magic Number Natural gas prices have rallied, albeit from very low levels Note: Generic 1st-month natural gas futures contract. But the U.S. gas market is a patchwork of regions, with local pricing often markedly different from the benchmark Nymex futures price because of constraints on pipeline capacity. Such is the case in Appalachia, where Rice and Vantage have their core assets: Natural gas prices at the Dominion South Point hub in Pennsylvania have slipped back below 1 So sentiment overall is better than it was but hardly jubilant. Certainly, you might think a gas producer would have some problems going to investors and telling them it wants to raise more money selling new shares than it did at its IPO less than three years ago. But Rice seems to be handling it. To fund the deal, Rice is pulling multiple levers. Its selling almost 1.2 billion of new shares (including the greenshoe), which is more than it raised when the stock debuted in late 2013, according to Bloomberg data. It's issuing roughly another 1 billion to Vantage's private equity owners. All in all, the 85.1 million new shares are equal to a staggering 43 percent of the existing number outstanding. Increase in Rice Energy's Share Count to Fund This Deal In addition, Rice will immediately sell the pipeline assets that come as part of the package to its master limited partnership, Rice Midstream Partners, to cover 600 million of the cost. That money will come from a combination of the MLP using debt and selling new units or just handing some over to Rice. The seemingly endless appetite of U.S. capital markets is what has enabled the country's E&P firms to withstand OPEC's onslaught better than many expected heading into this crash. Despite (and because of) the crash, 2016 is a banner year for U.S. E&P stock offerings Note: Data for 2016 are year-to-date through September 27th. That isn't to say Rice is just riding a wave. It has managed rapid growth while keeping its borrowing in check -- a rare feat these days. Part of this is down to savvy use of futures: Rice's average realized gas price last year was 2.21 per million BTU before hedges but 3.18 -- 44 percent higher -- after. Indeed, one of the attractions of Vantage, other than its main acreage sitting neatly next to Rice's own, is its own hedge book. Roughly two-thirds of pro forma production next year is hedged. Rice's stock has been a star performer this year, despite the company selling another 561 million of stock in April to help fund another deal. The same goes for Rice Midstream, which has trounced the broader MLP sector. Rice's two securities have surged this year Note: Performance indexed to 100. So Rice is taking advantage of investors' generosity -- including Rice Midstream's current cost of equity below 4 percent -- and liquid futures markets to keep expanding. In the process, the deal also offers a way for Vantage's private equity owners to cash out and back into an established, listed stock rather than continue down the path of trying to IPO the company themselves. Is it an option open to everyone? No. Earlier this summer, I noted the club of E&P companies coming to the stock market to raise more money had shrunk somewhat compared to 2015. Equally, though, any company able to claim real estate in the Permian basin seems able to name their price. It's a trend that appears unsustainable if energy prices remain depressed and if interest rates should rise. But it's appeared unsustainable for quite some time already. And now along comes this Rice deal. OPEC may be showing some fatigue in its battle to recover market share. Until it finally beats the capital markets into submission, though, it should soldier on. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning in New York at ldenning1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.net","output":"Rice Energy's 2.7bn natural gas acquisition of Vantage Energy highlights the resilience of the US energy exploration and production (E&P) sector. Despite weak oil and gas markets, investors continue to back US E&P firms, who have been even more resilient with regard to the oil crash than many expected. However, the sector will come under increasing pressure if energy prices do not increase and if interest rates rise. The eventual outcome of the crisis will likely depend on which party - US E&P firms or OPEC - can survive for the longest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First of all, while the comparisons to \\"Princess Bride\\" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, \\"Stardust\\" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

Write an article based on this \\"Asylum seekers in the UK who claim to be torture victims are facing two-year delays to be examined because doctors are \\"overwhelmed\\" by caseloads, a report says.\\"","output":"Title: Asylum Seekers in the UK: Overburdened System leads to Two-Year Delays for Torture Victims Introduction The United Kingdom has long been a safe haven for asylum seekers escaping conflict, persecution, and human rights abuses from around the world. However, the country's overburdened healthcare system has led to a troubling backlog, severely impacting the lives and well-being of those desperately in need of help and support. As the government struggles to allocate resources to address the demand, recent reports have revealed a shocking situation: asylum seekers who claim to be victims of torture are now facing two-year delays before professionals can examine their cases. This article delves into the reasons behind these delays, how they affect the lives of asylum seekers, and the potential steps the government can take to improve the situation. Asylum Seekers and the UK Healthcare System The UK's healthcare system, administered by the National Health Service (NHS), provides medical care to every citizen, including asylum seekers. The provision of healthcare is a critical aspect of the asylum process, as individuals escaping horrific circumstances might require urgent medical attention, psychological support, and that their claims of torture are thoroughly investigated. However, the NHS, which has long been struggling with an increased demand for its services, has led to a bottleneck in the process of examining and treating asylum seekers. Among the most affected are those who claim to be victims of torture, as they require specialized assessments by doctors to validate their claims and, subsequently, qualify for an appropriate asylum process. Reasons for Overburdened Caseloads Several factors contribute to the overwhelming caseload of doctors involved in examining torture victims as part of the asylum process, including: 1. Increase in the number of asylum seekers: As global conflicts continue to escalate in various countries, the UK has experienced a surge in the number of people seeking refuge. Consequently, the number of cases needing examination has increased, causing strain on the healthcare system. 2. Limited availability of specialized doctors: Assessing alleged torture victims requires highly qualified and experienced healthcare professionals, who may be in short supply, particularly in rural or understaffed areas. 3. Lack of funding: The NHS has been facing budgetary constraints in recent years, with limited resources available to manage the ever-growing number of patients. Consequently, there are fewer healthcare professionals to handle the workload. Impact on Asylum Seekers and Torture Victims Facing delays in accessing healthcare services, asylum seekers who claim to be torture victims are subjected to further distress, as evidenced by the following: 1. Prolonged suffering: As torture survivors wait for their cases to be examined, they continue to endure physical and mental health issues arising from their traumatic experiences. Delays in getting support may lead to the exacerbation of these ailments. 2. Negative impact on asylum application: The verification of torture claims is crucial for applications to be granted asylum status. Delays in medical assessments may result in prolonged legal limbo, creating an uncertain future for those affected. 3. Compartmentalization: Without proper documentation of their torture experiences, asylum seekers may have difficulty integrating into UK society and fully participating in community life. Recommendations for Improvement The following recommendations could potentially alleviate the backlog of cases pertaining to asylum seekers and torture victims: 1. Increase funding: The UK government must invest in healthcare services to boost staff and resource capacities. This would help medical professionals address the crisis more efficiently. 2. Collaborate with NGOs and international agencies: Collaboration with organizations such as the United Nations and non-governmental entities can help in providing both the financial and human resources needed to examine and process cases. 3. Streamline asylum processes: Simplifying the asylum process may reduce the caseload on healthcare professionals, thereby expediting the processing time for all asylum seekers. 4. Train more specialized professionals: Educational and training programs could focus on increasing the number of qualified healthcare practitioners who can assess torture victims. Conclusion The plight of asylum seekers and torture victims facing delays in their examination process is a pressing issue that calls for urgent attention. A combination of increased funding, better resource allocation, and collaboration with international organizations is required to alleviate the distress faced by these individuals. By addressing this issue head-on, the UK can continue to be a safe haven for asylum seekers, ensuring that they receive the support and care they so desperately need."},{"instruction":"Moses Mortimer Barrett III (born July 22 1973) known by the stage name Petey Pablo is an American rapper from Greenville North Carolina.

The heads of government were the shoguns. Each was a member of the Ashikaga clan.  - Biography. Yamana Szen was born to Yamana Tokihiro (13671435), head of the Yamana clan. Tokihiro was the \\"shugo\\" governor of Tajima, Bingo, Aki, and Iga provinces. Tokihiro, who was often in bad health, retired in 1433 and passed his numerous lands to Szen. Szen went on to defeat Akamatsu Mitsuhide (13731441) in the Kakitsu Incident, and became governor Harima Province the same year.  - The in the history of Japan was a family who controlled the hereditary title of \\"shikken\\" (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual governmental power during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate.  - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said:  What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men . The Shogun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel , and so the two armies remained immobile for some time , but within a few months , the tensions had risen too far , and war simply could not be delayed any further . Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital , attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki . Fighting erupted between the two camps , and over the course of the next few days , many were killed , and many buildings destroyed , either by the soldiers or by looters . Each army gradually carved out a section of the city that they held and defended against the other ; Hosokawa 's army came to be known as the Eastern Army , as Yamana 's so - called \`\` Western Army '' controlled western sections of Kyoto . But not all the fighting took place within the city ; Hosokawa sent men onto the main roads , and into Yamana 's home provinces , to prevent his reinforcements from reaching the main battles . Though Hosokawa attacked first , he convinced the Shogun to brand Yamana , not himself , with the stigma of being a rebel against the Shogunate . He even...  - Life. Yoshimi was the abbot of a Jdo monastery when he was first approached in 1464 by Hosokawa Katsumoto, who wished to support a bid for Yoshimi to become shogun. He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become shogun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy.  - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces. Originally from Kzuke Province, and later centered in Inaba province, the clan claimed descendance from the Seiwa Genji line, and from Minamoto no Yoshishige in particular. The clan took its name from the village of Yamana in present-day Gunma Prefecture. They were valued retainers under Minamoto no Yoritomo, and counted among his \\"gokenin\\".  - The was a civil war that lasted from 1467 to 1477, during the Muromachi period in Japan. \\"nin\\" refers to the Japanese era during which the war was fought.

The \\"nin War\\": This conflict began as a controversy over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement  whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa); but this succession dispute was merely a pretext for rival groups of \\"daimys\\" to fight in a struggle for military supremacy. In the end, there was no clearcut winner. The complex array of factional armies simply fought themselves into exhaustion.  - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity.

What is the relationship between 'hosokawa katsumoto' and 'samurai'? Answer:","output":"Hosokawa Katsumoto was a prominent Japanese samurai during the Muromachi period (1336-1467) and one of the Kanrei (Deputies to the Shogun). Born into the influential Hosokawa clan, Katsumoto made significant contributions to Japanese history, particularly his involvement in the creation of Ryōan-ji, a famous temple known for its rock garden, and his role in the Ōnin War. The Ōnin War (1467-1477) was a civil war that began as a dispute between Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Sōzen over the succession of the Ashikaga shogunate after the retirement of Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Katsumoto supported Yoshimasa's brother, Ashikaga Yoshimi, while Sōzen supported Yoshimasa's son, Ashikaga Yoshihisa. The war eventually escalated into a nationwide conflict involving numerous daimyos (feudal lords) and their samurai armies. As a samurai, Hosokawa Katsumoto was a member of the warrior class that ruled feudal Japan and served a vital role in the military, administration, and governance of the country. The samurai class was characterized by their martial prowess, adherence to the code of bushido (the way of the warrior), which emphasized loyalty, honor, and personal integrity, and their service to a lord, or daimyo. In this capacity, Katsumoto was both a samurai warrior and a daimyo who led his own army of samurai during the Ōnin War."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Question 2: What can be the brilliant idea to deal with Alcohol/liquor sale in India by Govt. of India? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answering Question 1: Step 1: Find out the historical reasons for alcohol being sold in multiples of 180ml in India. According to historical information, the alcohol industry in India began to take off during the British colonial rule.  Step 2: Understand the unit of measurement used during the British rule. During the British rule, the imperial system of measurements was widely used across India. One pint was a common unit of measurement, which is approximately equal to 568ml. Step 3: Discover the reasoning behind selling alcohol in smaller quantities than a pint. Due to affordability and accessibility, people preferred to consume alcohol in smaller quantities. Therefore, the alcohol industry in India started selling alcohol in half-pint bottles. Step 4: Convert half-pint to metric measurement. As one pint equals 568ml, half-pint measures approximately 284ml. Step 5: Identify the steps taken by the government to standardize alcohol measurements. The government eventually decided to standardize alcohol measurements in India to align more closely with the metric system. 180ml became a standard measure, replacing the half-pint (284ml) size. As a result, alcohol began to be sold primarily in multiples of 180ml in India. Answer to Question 1: Alcohol in India is sold in multiples of 180ml due to historical reasons when the alcohol industry started in India during British colonial rule. The measure shifted from half-pint (284ml) to 180ml as the government standardized alcohol measurements using the metric system. Answering Question 2: Step 1: Identify the objectives of the Indian government in dealing with alcohol sale. Some of the significant objectives of the Indian government concerning alcohol sale are revenue generation, regulating consumption, and ensuring public health and safety. Step 2: Consider a brilliant idea that addresses these objectives. One such idea could be the implementation of a central and state-regulated online platform for the sale and distribution of alcohol across the country. Step 3: Explain how the online platform would work. - Create a centralized and state-regulated online platform for purchasing alcohol. - Implement a digital ID verification system to ensure only legal-age customers can access the platform. - Set up a delivery system with licensed distributors responsible for fulfilling orders and ensuring proper handling. - Set up a monitoring system for the sale and consumption of alcohol. - Implement a taxation system that ensures revenue generation for states. Step 4: Highlight the benefits of the proposed system. - Reducing overconsumption and binge drinking through controlled sales - Ensuring the legal age limit for purchase and consumption is strictly adhered to - Providing a secure and transparent platform for buyers and sellers, reducing corruption in the alcohol trade - Ensuring state revenue is collected efficiently through a streamlined taxation system - Reducing incidences of spurious alcohol-related deaths by maintaining proper quality control Answer to Question 2: A brilliant idea for the government to deal with alcohol sale in India could be implementing a centralized and state-regulated online platform for sale and distribution of alcohol, which addresses objectives like revenue generation, controlling consumption, and maintaining public health and safety. To address the initial query, the answer to these two questions is not the same. The first question deals with the historical reasons behind alcohol being sold in multiples of 180ml, while the second question proposes an idea for the government to manage alcohol sales in India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? which american sporting event took place for the first time in 1967?","output":"The answer to this question is the Super Bowl. The first Super Bowl, known as Super Bowl I, took place on January 15, 1967. This American sporting event is the championship game played annually between the winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC) within the National Football League (NFL). Super Bowl I featured the Green Bay Packers, representing the NFL, and the Kansas City Chiefs, representing the American Football League (AFL). At that time, the NFL and AFL were rival leagues, and the game was originally referred to as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. The Packers won the game with a score of 35-10, and Packers' head coach Vince Lombardi would later have the trophy awarded to the winning team named in his honor – the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The idea of the Super Bowl came into existence as a result of the AFL-NFL merger in 1966. Both leagues agreed to have their respective champions face each other in a final game, in an effort to determine the world champion of American football. The first four Super Bowls were played between the AFL and NFL league champions before the two leagues completed their merger in 1970, creating the currently unified NFL with its two conferences, the NFC and AFC. The Super Bowl has since become the pinnacle of American sports and a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers worldwide. The championship game is usually played on the first Sunday of February, which has become known as \\"Super Bowl Sunday.\\" The event is marked by elaborate pre-game and halftime shows, featuring some of the most prominent musicians and performers in the entertainment industry. Additionally, the commercials aired during the broadcast have become a major aspect of the Super Bowl experience, as many companies compete to create the most memorable and entertaining ads. In summary, the American sporting event that took place for the first time in 1967 is the Super Bowl, which is the championship game between the NFC and AFC champions within the NFL. The first Super Bowl featured the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, with the Packers emerging as the first Super Bowl champions. Since then, the Super Bowl has evolved into a celebrated cultural event, reaching audiences across the globe and becoming a cornerstone of American sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Leslie hates the caffeine rush. It was an ordinary day at the office as Jason reached for his fourth cup of coffee. The rich aroma of the freshly brewed coffee filled the air, keeping him alert and focused. He couldn't understand why Leslie, his coworker sitting just a few desks away, never seemed to enjoy the perks of caffeine-laced beverages. Leslie hated the caffeine rush, saying it made her feel anxious and jittery. Step 1: Observe the characters' preferences. Step 2: Consider their habits and reasoning behind those habits. Step 3: Incorporate those differences in their routines as the story progresses. Jason carefully sipped his coffee, making sure not to spill a drop on the important documents lying on his desk. As he continued to work on his report, he found himself pondering the pros and cons of his caffeine habit. On one hand, his productivity soared as the caffeine stimulated his senses; on the other hand, he relied heavily on the daily boost, feeling sluggish without it. Step 4: Introduce a conflict or dilemma for the characters. Step 5: Show the internal thought process as they assess the situation.

As Jason was lost in his thoughts, Leslie walked over to his desk and placed a cup of herbal tea in front of him. \\"I noticed you've been reaching for that coffee quite often,\\" she said with a friendly smile. \\"Why don't you give this a try?

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service canceled tsunami advisories for Canada, Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California. Tsunami Warning Center officials said wave heights were diminishing in Hawaii, though swimmers and boaters should be careful of strong or unusual currents. The biggest waves — about 5 feet (1.5 meters)high — appeared to hit Maui. There were no immediate reports of damage, though one person died in a fatal crash near a road that was closed because of the threat near Oahu’s north shore. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said the state was lucky to avoid more severe surges. “We’re very, very grateful that we can go home tonight counting our blessings,” Abercrombie said.

Information:  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console .  - The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The name \\"intellivision\\" is a portmanteau of \\"intelligent television\\". Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'night stalker ' with the relationship of 'developer'.  Choices: - atari  - atari , inc .  - french  - intellivision  - mattel  - produce Answer:","output":"The entity related to 'Night Stalker' with the relationship of 'developer' is Mattel. The text specifies that \\"Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console\\" and the Intellivision console was released by \\"Mattel Electronics\\". Therefore, it would be appropriate to infer that Mattel, the company that created and released the Intellivision console, would also be the developer of the games that are compatible with their system. It is a common practice for home console creators to also develop games exclusive to their platforms, especially during the early stages of a console's life in order to generate interest in their product.  Moreover, when parsing the relationship between 'Night Stalker' and 'developer', it is also crucial to note that video games can be developed by a variety of entities including individuals, small teams, or large corporations. This differs from other types of traditional media like movies and music, where the production process is more standardized and typically involves a bigger team. In the case of 'Night Stalker', it was developed by a commercial company (Mattel) for its own dedicated gaming platform (the Intellivision). Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the development of a video game incorporates various elements such as designing and coding the game, creating and integrating visual art and animations, composing and fitting music and sound effects, and possibly writing dialogue and storylines. Hence, saying that Mattel is the developer of 'Night Stalker' implicitly implies that Mattel would be responsible for these facets of the game's production. It also signifies that Mattel might own the intellectual property rights to 'Night Stalker', meaning they would have control over its distribution and any potential sequels or spin-offs. So, when we understand 'developer' in this broad context, Mattel fits into that category for 'Night Stalker'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Next question: what happened to guam during the spanish american war?","output":"The Spanish-American War, which lasted from April to August 1898, was a conflict between the United States and Spain, primarily over the issue of Cuba. However, the war also had significant impacts on other Spanish territories in the Pacific, including Guam, an island in the Mariana Islands archipelago. Before the war, Guam had been a Spanish possession for more than 300 years, following its colonization by the Spanish empire in the 17th century. By the 19th century, it served as a key coaling station for Spanish naval and merchant vessels sailing between the Philippines and the Americas. As the Spanish-American War unfolded, the United States sought to weaken Spain's presence in the Pacific and acquire its territories in the region. On June 20, 1898, under orders from President William McKinley and Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, Captain Henry Glass of the U.S.S. Charleston was directed to \\"capture, destroy, or expel\\" Spanish armed forces from Guam. The U.S.S. Charleston, along with three transport ships carrying troops of the 1st California Volunteer Regiment, arrived off the coast of Guam on June 20, 1898. Surprisingly, the Spanish authorities on the island were completely unaware that their country was at war with the United States at the time and were unprepared for any sort of conflict. Captain Glass ordered his crew to fire a few rounds from the Charleston's cannons as a means of provocation. The Spanish governor, Juan Marina, initially believed these shots to be a salute, and he sent a small boat with officers to return the \\"salute,\\" only to be informed by the Americans that war had been declared and that they were taking over the island. The Spanish governor, along with 54 Spanish soldiers and civilians, were subsequently captured and sent back to Manila as prisoners of war. Thus, the taking of Guam by the United States was a bloodless event. There was no fighting or loss of life on either side, and the island was captured without serious resistance. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed, formally ending the Spanish-American War. Under the terms of the treaty, Spain ceded Guam, along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines, to the United States, marking the end of Spanish colonial rule in the Pacific territories. This also marked the beginning of American colonization and the development of Guam as an important strategic military outpost for the United States in the Pacific. Today, Guam remains an unincorporated U.S. territory, hosting several U.S. military bases and serving as a key strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend  with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \\"master designer.\\" Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. During his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative...

James Maury \\"Jim\\" Henson (September 24, 1936 - May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, and filmmaker who achieved international fame as the creator of the Muppets. He was born in Greenville, Mississippi and raised in Leland, Mississippi and Hyattsville, Maryland. Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. He created Sam and Friends while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. James Maury Henson was born in Greenville, Mississippi on September 24, 1936, the younger of two children of Paul Ransom Henson (1904-1994), an agronomist for the United States Department of Agriculture, and his wife Betty Marcella (nee Brown, 1904-1992). He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to University Park, Maryland in the late 1940s, near Washington, D.C. He remembered the arrival of the family's first television as \\"the biggest event of his adolescence,\\" having been heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom on Kukla, Fran and Ollie and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties when he would teach Sunday School, but he wrote to a Christian Science church in 1975 to inform them that he was no longer a practicing member.  Henson began working for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in 1954 while attending Northwestern High School, creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. He enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park as a studio arts major upon graduation, thinking that he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department introduced him to the craft and textiles courses in the College of Home Economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of the Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character Kermit the Frog. He remained at WRC from 1954 to 1961.  In the show, Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television, including using the frame defined by the camera shot to allow the puppet performer to work from off-camera. He believed that television puppets needed to have \\"life and sensitivity\\" and began making characters from flexible, fabric-covered foam rubber, allowing them to express a wider array of emotions at a time when many puppets were made of carved wood. A marionette's arms are manipulated by strings, but Henson used rods to move his Muppets' arms, allowing greater control of expression. Additionally, he wanted the Muppet characters to \\"speak\\" more creatively than was possible for previous puppets, which had random mouth movements, so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue.  When Henson began work on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a financial success but, after graduating from college, he began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers who looked on their work as an art form. He and Jane began dating after his return to the United States. They were married in 1959 and had five children: Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).

Which patient would more likely consume more food than needed, patient A or patient B?  John is a physician in the local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John determines that patient A is obese, and patient B is not obese. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his findings.  Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The answer is:","output":"Patient A would more likely consume more food than needed. The paragraph mentions that obesity occurs when the body mass index (BMI) is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater, and that people who consistently consume more food energy than they need may become obese. Patient A is described as being obese, while Patient B is not. This indicates that Patient A has been consuming more food and energy than their body requires, leading to the storage of unused energy in the form of body fat. The hint provided explains that any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. This suggests that individuals who consume more food than needed gain weight due to the accumulation of excess body fat. Consequently, obese individuals, such as patient A, are likely to have consumed more food than needed compared to non-obese individuals, such as patient B. Moreover, the doctor, John, is responsible for prescribing medicine according to his findings. In this case, he would likely be prescribing medication or recommending lifestyle changes that address the issue of obesity in patient A by focusing on their excess food consumption that has contributed to their weight gain. This reinforces the idea that patient A is more likely to consume more food than needed when compared to patient B. In conclusion, given the details provided in the paragraph, patient A would more likely consume more food than needed when compared to patient B. This is because patient A is obese, which is a result of consistently consuming more food energy than required, thus causing an accumulation of body fat and an increased BMI."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 298 victims on board tragic flight MH17 would have been killed instantly or remained conscious for only a few seconds after the plane was struck down by a missile, an Australian expert has claimed. Forensic scientist David Royds, from the University of Canberra, told the Herald Sun that it's 'very unlikely the passengers would have suffered' when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 was shot down by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. As investigators continue to piece together what happened, Professor Royds' analysis offers some comfort to the families of the victims, including 37 Australians, who he says would have had 'no time to worry'. 'It’s very unlikely the passengers would have suffered, there would have been no time to worry,' he told the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video. Professor Royds says the victims would not have had time to react to what happened, if not killed instantly, when the missile struck MH17. The bodies of the around 200 victims have been transported to eastern Ukraine. Professor Royd says dramatic and immediate drops in temperature and cabin pressure would have rendered them unconscious. David Royds (right), who led investigations in the Bali bombing, says passengers would not have suffered. Professor Boyd, who led forensic investigations into the Bali bombings, says that an explosion would have triggered a chain reaction that would have 'rendered the passengers unconscious within seconds' - including dramatic and instant drops in air pressure and temperature and a loss of oxygen. It comes as victims' bodies were transported via train to eastern Ukraine, but families were concerned that the painstaking identification process could take months. An Australian air force plane and refrigerated trucks have arrived in Holland but Ukraine says there were only 200 recovered from the crash site. Experts are also concerned that readings from MH17's black boxes may reveal nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators. And while photos have emerged showing damage to the front panels from the doomed airline point, which may be conclusive evidence of a missile strike, Professor Boyd says the victims' bodies themselves may provide 'trace evidence of shrapnel wounds'. Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally, it has been reported. A piece of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, in a field near Rozsypne in the eastern Ukraine, several miles from the largest concentration of debris. According to analysts, the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high-velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads like the SA-11 \\"Buk\\" missiles American officials have said likely brought down the plane. Experts have warned that the 'black boxes' from MH17 may yield nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators. Reed Foster, a defense analyst, told the New York Times that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile. According to Mr Foster, the SA-11 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel. An SA-11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target. Meanwhile Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Operation Bring Them Home - to bring the 37 Australian victims back - would be headed up by former defence chief Angus Houston, who also coordinated Australian search efforts for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in Kharkiv - in Ukraine's east - where Australian and Dutch representatives will prepare them for transport to the Netherlands for the identification process. A Boeing C-17 of the Australian Air Force stands at the Eindhoven Airbase in The Netherlands. The aircraft will, together with aircrafts of the Dutch Air Force, repatriate from Kharkiv to Eindhoven the bodies of the victims. Mr Abbott also wrote in the condolence book for the plane crash victims on Tuesday at Parliament House. Carriages of death: A train carrying the remains victims of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 disaster arrives in the Ukrainian government-held city of Kharkiv. Journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of Kharkiv, where the victims will be flown to the Netherlands. The transportation and identification process in Ukraine and the Netherlands will involve consular officers, Australian Federal Police experts and air safety investigators. Despite Tuesday's progress, Mr Abbott warned there was 'still a long, long way to go'. 'After the crime comes the cover-up,' he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. 'What we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale, and obviously that has to stop.' Mr Abbott said he understood the families' frustration at the lengthy process, but it was something that needed to be done. 'I need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks,' he said. The train arrived in Kharkiv on Tuesday night, carrying the bodies of MH17 victims from the crash site. The bodies will be flown to the Netherlands from Kharkiv to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts. Operation Bring Them Home started just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop helped secure a unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council to allow 'safe, secure, full and unrestricted access' to the Malaysia Airlines crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy. 'There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site,' Ms Bishop told the Security Council. 'The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest.'All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. 'Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.' Mo Maslin, Otis Maslin and Evia Maslin - aged 12, eight and 10 - were among the Australian victims. Fatima Dyczynski (left) and Jack O'Brien (right) were another two victims of the MH17 crash. Mr Abbott's formal message of condolence to the victims' families on behalf of the nation. Pro-Russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft, possibly with a missile supplied by Moscow - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash. Mr Razak said the boxes were handed over to the Malaysian team in Donetsk at 9pm Ukraine time on Monday. The small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices. Mr Razak revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with 'those' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the MH17 crash site. The contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy. 'Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.' The Prime Minister said that in. another breakthrough an independent international investigation team. would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site. 'I. must stress that although agreement has been reached, there remain a. number of steps required before it is completed,' Mr Razak said. Tragic: A toy is placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine. UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface-to-air missile which destroyed the MH17 was supplied by Russia. 'There. is work still to be done, work which relies on continued communication. in good faith. [Rebel leader] Mr Borodai and his people have so far. given their co-operation. 'I. ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this. agreement is honoured; that the remains of our people are returned, that. the black box is handed over, and that the international team is. granted full access to the site. 'Only. then can the investigation into MH17 truly begin; only then can the. victims be afforded the respect they deserve.

'In. recent days, there were times I wanted to give greater voice to the. anger and grief that the Malaysian people feel. And that I feel. But. sometimes, we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome. 'I. understand that for the families, nothing can undo this damage. The. lives taken cannot be given back; the dignity lost cannot be regained. 'My. heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on MH17. We hope. and pray that the agreement reached tonight helps bring them a clear. step towards closure.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A tragic airplane flight, called MH17, was hit by a missile and crashed. Many people, including 37 Australians, lost their lives. An expert says that the passengers probably didn't suffer, because everything happened very fast. They would have been unconscious quickly after the missile hit the plane. There are special boxes called \\"black boxes\\" that can help figure out what happened during a crash, but in this case, they might not help investigators as much as we hope. Many people are working together to help bring the victims home to their families. They have to be very careful and do things properly, so it might take some time.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Question: In humans, a trait can be determined by one pair or many pairs of pick from the following. *genes; *microbes; *cells; *organs; Answer:","output":"In humans, a trait can be determined by one pair or many pairs of genes. Traits are specific characteristics or features that are inherited from one generation to another through the transmission of genetic information. Genes are segments of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that are responsible for encoding instructions on how to synthesize proteins or regulate the expression of other genes. These proteins and their expression patterns ultimately determine the specific traits observed in an individual. In some cases, a single pair of genes (one from each parent) is responsible for determining a trait. This type of inheritance is called Mendelian inheritance or simple inheritance, named after Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. Mendel's experiments on pea plants led to the discovery of the basic laws of inheritance. In Mendelian inheritance, a single gene has a dominant and a recessive allele, with the dominant allele expressing itself in an individual's phenotype if present, even if the recessive allele is present as well. An example of a Mendelian trait is a person's blood type, which can be A, B, AB, or O. In other cases, a trait can be determined by many pairs of genes, interacting in different ways to produce a wide range of phenotypic outcomes. This is known as polygenic inheritance. In polygenic traits, multiple genes contribute to the final characteristic, and the phenotypic expression of an individual depends on the combination of alleles inherited from both parents and the way these genes interact with one other and the environment. Examples of polygenic traits include human skin color, height, and eye color. The wide variation in these traits among individuals is due to the collective influences of numerous genes and external factors such as nutrition or sunlight exposure. It is important to note that while genes play a vital role in determining the traits of an individual, they do not act in isolation. The environment in which a person lives, their experiences, and various other factors can also significantly impact the expression of traits and contribute to the complexity of human phenotypic diversity. As our understanding of genetics and the influence of other factors on traits advances, it becomes increasingly evident that the intricate combination of genetics and environmental interactions plays a crucial role in determining the unique traits exhibited by humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon?  Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that the volcanoes on Sarahn would be more active than on Timon. The planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift, much like Earth during the Paleozoic era, with continents breaking apart and moving. This movement causes increased volcanic activity as more oceanic crust is formed. When continents move apart, new oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This new crust is relatively hotter and less dense than the older oceanic crust, which causes the ocean floor to rise and subsequently leads to a rise in sea level. This increased volcanic activity is indicative of a more geologically active environment on Sarahn, as demonstrated by the historical examples of Earth during the Paleozoic era. On the other hand, Timon is described as a stable planet with no continental movement for quite some time. This implies that there is less volcanic activity, as there is no ongoing process of continental drift and formation of new oceanic crust. As a result, the volcanic activity on Timon would be less active compared to that on Sarahn. In conclusion, the active geological transformations occurring on Sarahn, such as continental drift and the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity, make it more likely that the volcanoes on Sarahn would be more active than those on Timon. Timon's lack of continental movement and overall stability result in less volcanic activity. Thus, we can determine that the volcanoes on Sarahn are more active compared to those on Timon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This jaw may belong to Philip II, father of Alexander the Great.      A decades-old mystery about the body of Alexander the Great's father has been solved, anthropologists claim.      A new analysis of bones from a Macedonian tomb complex reveals a skeleton with a knee injury so severe that it would have caused a noticeable limp in life. This injury matches some historical records of one sustained by Philip II, whose nascent empire Alexander the Great would expand all the way to India.      The skeleton in question, however, is not the one initially thought to be Philip II's — instead, it comes from the tomb next door. The skeletons are the subject of an entrenched debate among experts on ancient Greece and Macedonia. While some praised the new study, others pushed back, suggesting the new research will not quell 40 years of controversy.      \\"The knee is the clincher,\\" said Maria Liston, an anthropologist at the University of Waterloo, who was not involved in the new study, which is detailed today (July 20) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). [See Photos of the Tomb at Vergina and Mysterious 'Philip' Bones]      \\"This publication in PNAS is incorrect,\\" said Theodore Antikas, a researcher at Aristotle University in Greece and author of another controversial study on bones from the tombs.      A violent history      This artist's impression reveals how the fused bones would have set Philip II's leg in a permanently bent position. Credit: Image Courtesy Arturo Asensio      The story of Philip II is wrought with twists and turns. In 336 B.C., the king was murdered by one of his bodyguards. The motives for the assassination are unclear. Some ancient historians wrote that the murder was an act of revenge stemming from a sordid tale of suicide and sexual assault between Philip II's male lovers and other members of the court.      Whatever the cause, murder was de rigueur for the Macedonian royal family. Within days of Philip II's murder, one of his wives, Olympias — mother of Alexander the Great — let her own homicidal tendencies run free. According to the Latin historian Justin, Olympias killed the newborn daughter of Philip II's newest wife, Cleopatra, in her mother's arms. She then forced Cleopatra to hang herself.      A generation later, after the death of Alexander the Great, the conqueror's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (also spelled Arrhidaios) took the throne. Philip III Arrhidaeus was king in name only, and ancient historians record him as being mentally unfit. His wife, Eurydice, was a warrior, however. She was determined to make her husband more than a figurehead puppet for Alexander's generals, who were by this time vying for power in the void left by his death.      But Philip III Arrhidaeus and Eurydice would lose that battle. In 317 B.C., Olympias came out against them. The couple's troops refused to fight the forces of the mother of Alexander the Great. Olympias had the pair killed and buried. Some months later, they were exhumed and cremated in a display to shore up legitimacy for the next king. [Family Ties: 8 Truly Dysfunctional Royal Families]      Cremation and controversy      Philip II. Cleopatra. Philip III. Eurydice.      When archaeologists uncovered a Macedonian tomb complex near the Greek city of Vergina in the 1970s, they knew they had royal burials on their hands. But which tombs belonged to which royals?      There are three tombs at the site. Tomb I had been plundered in antiquity but contained human remains and an intricate wall painting of the Rape of Persephone. Tomb II was intact. Inside were the cremated bones of a man and a woman, surrounded by armor and other lavish items. Tomb III is widely accepted to belong to Alexander IV, Alexander the Great's son.      Initially, the bodies in lavish Tomb II were identified as those of Philip II and Cleopatra. But debate has raged over possible injuries to the male skull, over the ages and dating of the skeletons, and over whether the bones were burned with flesh on or off. (As Philip III Arridaeus was cremated long after burial, archaeologists looked for signs that the bones had been burned after the flesh had rotted away.) Many archaeologists suspected the two burned bodies were not Philip II and Cleopatra, but Philip III and Eurydice.      The two sides have been lobbing research papers at each other for years, but seemed at an impasse.      \\"In fact, the issue has become eminently political, and for years a sort of vendetta has been raging between factions,\\" said historian Miltiades Hatzopoulos of International Hellenic University, who was not involved in the new research.      Now, Antonis Bartsiokas of Democritus University of Thrace in Greece has taken a different tact. Instead of examining the burnt bones in Tomb II, he and his team took a close look at three skeletons from the tomb next door.      The smoking gun      The analysis revealed that the man in Tomb I was in his 40s when he died, and stood 5 feet 9 inches tall (180 centimeters) — impressive for the era. The woman died around 18 years of age, based on measurements of the fusion of her bones. She was about 5 feet 4 inches tall (165 cm). The baby was a newborn, probably only a week to three weeks past the due date.      The ages match historical records of Philip II, Cleopatra and their infant. But the real smoking gun, Liston said, was a knee injury on the male skeleton.      The left leg of an adult male skeleton found in Tomb I at Vergina. The thigh bone (femur) and one of the bones of the lower leg (the tibia) are fused, and hole at the knee suggests a devastating penetrating injury. Credit: Image Courtesy Javier Trueba      The man's left thigh bone, or femur, had fused with one of his lower leg bones, the tibia. This fusion left the knee joint frozen in place at a 79-degree angle. A hole in the bone suggests the wound was caused by a penetrating injury from a projectile, such as a spear.      And that's where things get exciting. According to historical records, Philip II was injured in the leg during a battle in 345 B.C. He then limped for the rest of his life.      \\"When I found the femur fused to the tibia at the knee joint, I suddenly remembered the leg injury of Philip, but I could not recall any details,\\" Bartsiokas told Live Science. \\"I then ran to study the historical evidence.\\"      He found a description of Philip II's wounds in the writings of the ancient historian Justin. \\"At that moment,\\" he wrote in an email to Live Science, \\"I knew the bone must belong to Philip!\\" [Bones With Names: Long-Dead Bodies Archaeologists Have Identified]      The injury does match descriptions of Philip II's limp, the University of Waterloo's Liston said.      \\"This was a devastating injury that separated the knee joint and left it probably completely unstable until it fused,\\" Liston told Live Science. The pain would have been excruciating, she said.      After reading the new PNAS paper, she said, she asked two middle-age men at her lab in Athens to stand on one foot, with the toes of the other foot just touching the ground. The angles of their knees were 72 degrees and 80 degrees. This ad hoc experiment suggests that, like Philip II, the man in the tomb could have walked, but only with difficulty. He probably could have ridden a horse — but he may have been vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat.      \\"This injury may also explain why Philip, a skilled warrior, was so utterly unable to fight off the assassins,\\" Liston said. \\"With this knee, he would have limited mobility and very poor balance.\\"      An end to controversy?      If Philip II and his wife and baby occupy Tomb I, it stands to reason that Philip III and his wife are the contested skeletons in Tomb II, Bartsiokas and his colleagues write today (July 20) in PNAS. [See Images of the Tomb II and Bones Inside]      Whether the finding will rewrite history remains to be seen. The museum at the site of the Royal Tombs of Vergina identifies Tomb II, not Tomb I, as belonging to Philip II. So does UNESCO, which classifies the monuments as a royal heritage site.      \\"These are bold claims that I don't think will be very welcome in certain quarters in Greece,\\" said Jonathan Musgrave, an anatomist at the University of Bristol, who has argued that the bones in Tomb II belong to Philip II and Cleopatra.      Indeed, researchers who have argued for Tomb II as Philip II's final resting place were not quickly convinced by the new study. In 2014, two bags of human and animal bones were found in a storage area with plaster from Tomb I, Antikas told Live Science. He and his team have analyzed those bones, he said, and found that Tomb I contained not two adults and a baby as discussed in Bartsiokas' new paper, but two adults, a teenager, a fetus and three newborns. Those findings have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, pending permission for further study from Greece's Central Archaeological Council, Antikas said.      \\"Any prejudgment concerning the occupants is impossible before the complete context is re-examined,\\" said Chrysoula Paliadeli, an archaeologist at the director of the Aristotle University excavations at Vergina.      Even the \\"smoking gun\\" leg wound falls under scrutiny; ancient historians were not always very detailed or clear with their sourcing. Bartsiokas and his team trust the writings of Demosthenes, a contemporary of Philip II, who simply wrote that the king was wounded in his leg. But 300 years later historian Didymos wrote that Philip's wound was in his right thigh, said Hatzopoulos of International Hellenic University. The wound on the skeleton analyzed by Bartsiokas was on the left leg.      It might seem natural to trust the historian who was writing at the time of Philip II's life versus the one writing 300 years later, but Didymos' source was probably Theopompos, who did live at the same time as Philip II, Hatzopoulos said.      \\"Having followed this controversy through four decades I have come to the conclusion that in this particular issue one cannot put much faith in the so-called 'exact sciences,'\\" Hatzopoulos said. \\"Reputed scientists have contradicted one another time and time again.\\"      Bartsiokas and his team seemed prepared for ongoing strife.      \\"I think that we have made a very strong case,\\" said study co-author Juan-Luis Arsuaga of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. \\"Now the focus of attention will turn to Tomb I. I am open to debate.\\"      Editor's Note: This article was updated to correct a mention of Desmothenes that should be Didymos.      Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitterand Google+.

The age estimates of the three occupants are consistent with those derived from the historical sources. Cleopatra's (Philip’s wife) child was born a few days before Philip II’s assassination and both were murdered soon after Philip’s assassination. It follows that Tomb II belongs to King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice and may well contain some of the armor of Alexander the Great. Thus, a nearly 40-y-old mystery concerning the Royal Tombs of Vergina has finally been solved that puzzled historians, archaeologists, and physical anthropologists.      Abstract      King Philip II was the father of Alexander the Great. He suffered a notorious penetrating wound by a lance through his leg that was nearly fatal and left him lame in 339 B.C.E. (i.e., 3 y before his assassination in 336 B.C.E.). In 1977 and 1978 two male skeletons were excavated in the Royal Tombs II and I of Vergina, Greece, respectively. Tomb I also contained another adult (likely a female) and a newborn skeleton. The current view is that Philip II was buried in Tomb II. However, the male skeleton of Tomb II bears no lesions to his legs that would indicate lameness. We investigated the skeletal material of Tomb I with modern forensic techniques. The male individual in Tomb I displays a conspicuous case of knee ankylosis that is conclusive evidence of lameness. Right through the overgrowth of the knee, there is a hole. There are no obvious signs that are characteristic of infection and osteomyelitis. This evidence indicates that the injury was likely caused by a severe penetrating wound to the knee, which resulted in an active inflammatory process that stopped years before death. Standard anthropological age-estimation techniques based on dry bone, epiphyseal lines, and tooth analysis gave very wide age ranges for the male, centered around 45 y. The female would be around 18-y-old and the infant would be a newborn. It is concluded that King Philip II, his wife Cleopatra, and their newborn child are the occupants of Tomb I. ||||| There are many unrecorded conquerors, battles and Romeo and Juliets in the vastness of prehistory whose stories are waiting to be told.

Campbell, director of archaeology at the Albanian Center for Marine Research. \\"The greatest age of discovery is happening right now. And the real fun is just about to begin,\\" Campbell said.      The “Tomb of Philip” in the northern Greek town of Vergina does not belong to King Philip II of Macedon, says new research which fuels the long-standing dispute over the final resting place of Alexander the Great’s father.      According to the study, a skeleton found in an adjacent tomb shows evidence of a leg wound which is consistent with the one sustained by Philip II, as reported by some historical accounts.      The claim is in stark contrast to other research published two months ago which maintains Alexander the Great’s father was indeed buried in the famous “Tomb of Philip.”      Photos: Great Archaeological Discoveries Ahead      Scholars have argued over Philip II’s tomb ever since Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos discovered the site of his likely burial in 1977-78. He excavated a large mound — the Great Tumulus — at Vergina on the advice of the English classicist Nicholas Hammond.      Among the monuments found within the tumulus were three tombs. One, called Tomb I, had been looted, but contained a stunning wall painting of the Rape of Persephone, along with fragmentary human remains.      Tomb II remained undisturbed and contained the almost complete cremated remains of a male skeleton in the main chamber and the cremated remains of a female in the antechamber. Grave goods included silver and bronze vessels, gold wreaths, weapons, armor and two gold larnakes.      Tomb III was also found undisturbed, with a silver funerary urn that contained the bones of a young male, and a number of silver vessels and ivory reliefs.      “There is an unanimous agreement that Tomb III, which has a façade strikingly similar to that of Tomb II, belongs to Alexander the Great’s son, Alexander IV,” Antonis Bartsiokas of the Democritus University of Thrace and Juan-Luis Arsuaga of the Centro Mixto Universidad Complutense de Madrid and colleagues wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).      In fact, most of the scholarly debate concentrates on the occupants of Tomb II.      “Despite anthropological and archaeological evidence that the tomb belongs to King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice, the archaeological establishment still maintains that Tomb II belongs to Philip II,” the researchers wrote.      Remains of Alexander the Great's Father Confirmed Found      A powerful 4th century B.C. military ruler from the Greek kingdom of Macedon, King Philip II gained control of Greece and the Balkan peninsula through tactful use of warfare, diplomacy, and marriage alliances (the Macedonians practiced polygamy).      His efforts — he reformed the Macedonian army and proposed the invasion of Persia — later provided the basis for the achievements of his son and successor Alexander the Great, who went on to conquer most of the known world.      The overlord of an empire stretching from Greece and Egypt eastward across Asia to India, Alexander died in Babylon, now in central Iraq, in June of 323 B.C. — just before his 33rd birthday.      His elusive tomb is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the ancient world.      Using scanning and radiography, Bartsiokas and colleagues analyzed a partial skeleton of a middle-aged male that had been long disinterred from Tomb I at Vergina.      The researchers judged the individual to be around 45 when he died, matching the age at which Philip was killed, and estimated he was 5.9 feet tall.      Photos: Female Sculptures Revealed in Greek Tomb      They noticed the individual had a knee joint showing signs of fusion (ankylosis), and a hole through the overgrowth of the knee, likely produced by a penetrating instrument, such as a fast-moving projectile, like a spear.      The wound “would have affected locomotion and rendered the person lame, with an uneven gait,” the researchers concluded.      According to some historical reports, a lance impaled Philip’s leg three years before his assassination in 336 BC, leaving him lame.      The injury “is conclusive evidence for the identification of one tomb occupant as Philip,” the researchers said.      Bartsiokas and colleagues also stated that Tomb I contains the remains of a 18-year-old female and a 42-week-old infant of unknown gender.      The researchers believe the individuals are Philip’s wife Cleopatra, and their newborn child, both killed shortly after Philip’s death. He was killed by his bodyguard Pausanias as he walked into a theater in the Macedonian capital of Aegae.      “As a consequence, Tomb II could only belong to King Arrhidaeus and Eurydice and may well contain some of the armor of Alexander the Great,” Bartsiokas and colleagues concluded.      However, according to Theodore Antikas, author of another study which concluded the bones found in Tomb II are those of Philip II and a Scythian princess, Bartsiokas and colleagues are missing a point—or more precisely, some bones.      In a letter to the editor of PNAS, Antikas, head of the anthropological research team of Vergina Excavation at Aristotle University, maintains Bartsiokas’s research has been done on a small part of the bones found in Tomb I in 1977-78.      According to the researcher, the bones from Tomb I took different routes ever since their discovery. Some were first kept at Vergina, and some were sent to the Archaeological Museum in Thessaloniki (AMT). ||||| Portrait of King Philip II of Macedonia in his late years, after having received a wound through his left leg by a lance. Credit: Arturo Asensio. A team of researchers from Greece, Spain and France has found evidence that suggests that the bones of King Phillip II of Macedon—father of Alexander the Great, were those found in Tomb I, not those found in Tomb II at the burial site in Vergina, Macedonia. The team's work and their findings have been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      Back in 1977, archeologists discovered ancient tombs at Vergina, and soon thereafter, researchers began offering arguments regarding the identities of the skeletons that were found in them—the focus of most of the attention has been on Tombs I and II, because it is believed they were the final resting place for some of Alexander the Great's relatives—most specifically, his father. Early on, many believed the bones found in Tomb II were his, though the identity of others buried along with him remained a matter of speculation. This theory was further bolstered by work done by a team of researches with results published just this past May. In this new effort, the researchers cite evidence that they believe proves bones found in Tomb I are those of Phillip, and that furthermore, other bones in the same tomb belong to his wife Cleopatra and his newly born baby.      The most striking evidence comes in the form of a leg bone—an upper thigh fused to a shin at the knee with a hole in it—it appears to align with historical texts that describe Philip as suffering a wound from a lance. Additional testing showed the bone had fused and smoothed over just a few years time, which also agrees with writings from the time—Phillip was murdered just a few years after suffering the injury. Dating showed the skeletal remains to be that of man approximately 45 years old, which is consistent with the age at which Philip reportedly died. The ancient writings also describe Cleopatra as being young, approximately 18 years old at the time of her death, which occurred shortly after Phillip was killed. Dating of the other bones in the Tomb I showed them to be from a woman of just that age range. Also, the early texts describe the baby, which was killed around the same time as well.      In studying the bones in Tomb II, the researchers concluded that they were entombed much later than those in Tomb I, too late for them to have been the remains of Philip. Taken together, the evidence proves that the bones in Tomb I were those of Philip, the researchers claim, suggesting that the matter has finally been settled for good.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band whose fans are described as \\"veritable teenyboppers\\"? from the following article ?  Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Help as much as you can. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

This policy was met with vehement opposition from leading Republican figures, who accused him of 'Orwellian doublespeak'. President Obama's reluctance to label the global terror threat for what it is, according to his critics, reflects a total misunderstanding of the exact nature of the enemy that the free world confronts. This article will examine the criticism painted against the former President by leading Republican figures. Senator Ted Cruz, a persistent critic of Obama, blasted his 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak' and criticized his administration's refusal to acknowledge that ISIS was an 'Islamic' terror group. According to Cruz, a refusal to acknowledge an enemy for what it is represents a dangerous misunderstanding. In the political games of semantics and connotations, the world could lose its ability to effectively combat the burgeoning problem that is terrorism, he argued. Former Texas Governor, Rick Perry, joined the fray, fiercely criticizing Obama’s rhetoric. 'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam; isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' These words point to Perry's frustration over the perceived hesitation by the Obama administration to robustly tackle the threat of ISIS terrorism. He argues that pertinent allies in the Middle East like Egypt and Jordan have already recognized the seriousness of the threat, raising ethical questions about America's leadership under the Obama administration. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush presented another critical perspective in this debate, slamming the Obama administration's stance. According to Bush, the administration was in possession of a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is.' These remarks underscore the perception of a fundamental disconnect between Obama's understanding of the terrorist threat and its ground realities – a chasm that could have severe implications in terms of policy and action. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, meanwhile, put a more direct blame on another prominent Democratic figure – Hillary Clinton. He claimed that 'Hillary’s war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.' Paul’s denunciation comes with an insurgent critic of the Obama-Clinton's foreign policy and its unanticipated and disastrous consequences, which, as many argue, have largely contributed to the creation of a fertile ground for terrorism. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal provided a different perspective on the crisis. He argued against the Obama administration's foreign aid policies – saying 'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism.' What the U.S. needs, Jindal suggested, is not a global effort to fight poverty, but a focused and unerring war against the actual threat – that is, radical Islamic terrorism. In conclusion, the Republican leaders' criticism of the Obama administration's terminology policy in regards to ISIS clearly reflects a fundamental difference in perception and approach towards handling the rising tide of global terrorism. The refusal of Obama, in their eyes, to label ISIS as an 'Islamic' terror group becomes symbolic of a much larger failure – that of grappling with the real nature of the threat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Jericho\\". However, they have managed to keep their true identities a secret from the public, only known to their agents and a few close friends. The story begins when Alex and Claire hit a creative rough patch while working on their highly anticipated latest novel \\"The Enigmatic Past\\". While battling writer's block, they hear about a peculiar centuries-old legend of a hidden manuscript in the secluded town of Hemlock Hill, Massachusetts. According to the legend, the manuscript is said to contain the secret for eternal love and has mysterious side effects on the inhabitants of the town. Intrigued by the idea and desperate to revive their waning creativity, the couple decides to embark on a romantic adventure to Hemlock Hill, hoping to rekindle their dwindling passion and collect some ideas for their novel along the way. As they arrive in the picturesque town, they befriend a group of locals who provide insights into the town's history and legends. Among the locals is an enigmatic old man by the name of Charles Blackwood, who cryptically mentions that he might know something about the manuscript and its last known location. As Alex and Claire dig deeper into the town's mystery, they begin to notice strange phenomena that directly connect with the story of the secret manuscript, such as elderly couples seeming to regain their youth and fiery passion overnight. Meanwhile, their own relationship starts to bloom anew, hinting at the power that the manuscript might hold. The couple starts to unravel a touching tale of forbidden love between the original author of the manuscript and his lover from centuries ago. Their love had transcended time and space, fueled by the power of their undying passion for one another. In their quest for the elusive manuscript, Claire confronts her inner darkness, while Alex battles his demons that arise due to his past insecurities. The unfolding story invigorates their love, teaching them invaluable lessons about forgiveness and moving forward. The climax of the film revolves around the final discovery of the mystical manuscript's location. Upon finding the manuscript, they are faced with a choice: use it to give eternal life to their love or take what they've learned from the journey and leave the manuscript's power dormant for future generations to decipher. In the end, Alex and Claire choose the latter option, understanding that love is a choice and it grows stronger by facing challenges, rather than relying on external forces. They decide to go back to their writer's life, inspired and rejuvenated. They incorporate the experiences from Hemlock Hill into their novel, producing the greatest work of their combined careers and solidifying their bond. \\"Written in Time\\" is a heartwarming and mysterious tale of two struggling novelists, who embark on an extraordinary voyage to rediscover their love, only to find that great stories and everlasting love come from the depths of the human spirit.

That is what we want. Stop the bloodshed. Stop it now. We know this is a risk for you, but take this risk,\\" Huberta von Voss-Wittig, the wife of Germany's U.N. ambassador, told CNN. Speaking to CNN in interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, Voss-Wittig said the Syrian first lady \\"should get her act together\\" and \\"not worry so much about her husband but worry a little bit more about women in her country.\\" A U.N. diplomat said the video was produced by Voss-Wittig and Sheila Lyall Grant, the wife of Britain's U.N. ambassador, \\"on their own initiative.\\" Voss-Wittig stresses that the video isn't a U.N. product or \\"done by us as spouses.\\" \\"It's done by us as women who care and as women who have an international profile ourselves,\\" she said. Profile: Asma al-Assad, Syria's first lady. Syria has been engulfed in violence for 13 months as a national uprising spread after the government began cracking down on peaceful protests. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the demonstrations began, while others put the death toll at more than 11,000. The video comes days after U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan forged what has become a fragile cease-fire. \\"We think it's a good moment now that the cease-fire has been installed. It's very wobbly, it's not quite working yet but we think she should not hide behind her husband's back anymore and should come forward with a straight message for peace,\\" Voss-Wittig said. \\"Stand up for peace, Asma,\\" a voice in the video demands. \\"Speak out now. For the sake of your people. Stop your husband and his supporters. Stop being a bystander.\\" In one clip, the Syrian first lady can be seen bending down to kiss a young girl stepping off a bus. The next image is of a woman embracing what appears to be a dead child. \\"Asma, when you kiss your own children goodnight, another mother will find the place next to her empty,\\" the narrator says.

In one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in London, she -- apparently using a false name -- inquired about six artworks that feature butterflies. The dealer responds that the works cost between Â£5,000 and Â£10,500 (7,800 and 16,500).

Chris and Colin Weir, who scooped a record £161million Euromillions jackpot in July 2011, dipped into their huge fortune to pay for spastic diplegic cerebral palsy sufferer Skye Swinton to pay for revolutionary surgery. The pair wrote a cheque after Skye's desperate mother Ruth, 38, wrote to the couple asking for help. Scroll down for video. Skye Swinton, 3, from Cheltenham pictured with her parents John and Ruth who have raised £40k for a life changing operation to help their daughter walk with the help of record Euromillions winners Colin and Chris Weir. Little Skye, pictured, who was born 13 weeks prematurely and suffers from spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, has spent much of her life in a wheelchair. She had expected her letter to be 'politely binned' but was stunned when she received a phone call telling her that the pair, from Largs in North Ayrshire, were happy to donate £28,000. Ecstatic Ruth, a former teacher and now full-time carer to Skye, said: 'It is just unbelievable and we are so delighted. 'I sent the letter months ago and so I just thought it would have been politely binned, so to get the phone call with the news was just fantastic. Born 13 weeks early and weighing a tiny 1lb 15oz, Skye's condition has left her confined to a wheelchair for much of her life. She is unsteady on her feet and unable to go any distance without tiring and dreams of walking and running like other children. Skye's family and friends managed to raise £12,000 towards their target of £40,000 but were still £28,000 short until Ruth's heartfelt letter persuaded generous Chris and Colin to part with the remainder of the cash. Skye's mother Ruth had written a desperate letter to Colin and Chris Weir asking for their help to raise £40,000 for her daughter's surgery. It is hoped that Skye, from Cheltenham Gloucestershire, will undergo delicate surgery - which involves partially cutting the nerve roots where they join the spinal cord - next summer pending vital medical assessments. An initial assessment, scans and x-rays will cost the family £800, with the operation priced at £23,500 and subsequent physiotherapy, expected to last two years, will cost around £15,000. Without surgery now, the youngster would need major orthopaedic surgery by the time she turns 10 or 11. Ruth, who is married to Skye's father John, also 38, said: 'There are still a number of medical hurdles to overcome, but now that we have raised the money we need, we can now concentrate on helping Skye reach her full potential. 'We were absolutely blown away with the support we've had, and the generosity we have been shown.' The family will continue fundraising in aid of Skye and will use the additional money to help her during her rehabilitation with planned fundraising events still to go ahead. In a statement, Mr and Mrs Weir said: 'Skye faces many challenges in the next year and she needs her mum and dad to be focused on her. That's why we've given a donation. 'Without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising, their time can be spent on Skye.' Mr and Mrs Weir have shown enormous generosity since winning their vast fortune. They donated their former £180,000 home to their neighbours after buying their new home and sponsored 15-year-old Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsey in the European and Italian Formula 3 events. Mr Weir, a former Scottish TV cameraman, donated £750,000 to his local football team, Largs Thistle, to pay off some of the club's debt and improve facilities. Colin and Chris Weir, pictured celebrating their Euromillions win, donated £28,000 towards Skye's £40,000 operation. The pair's £161million jackpot win in July 2012 remains the largest single lottery win in the UK. In August the couple also donated a five-figure sum to buy a prosthetic limb for cancer victim Kieran Maxwell, 13, of Heighington, near Darlington. They also pledged £900,000 towards a new £1.2million multi-use sports arena in their home town and helped talented young artist Lee Craigmile pay his fees to study in Italy. Mr and Mrs Weir payed a seven figure sum to the Scottish National Party to help fund its campaign for independence from the rest of the UK. They have also personally enjoyed their winnings, applying for planning permission to build a luxury indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and conservatory at their home. VIDEO: Celebrating in style!

But paleontologists object that no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have recently identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. The earliest known ancestor of primates is Archicebus achilles from around 55 million years ago. This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.\\".

(iv) To help readers make a better decision when they are buying a house. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: House buyers have three main choices: building from the ground up, moving into an old house or buying a new one. All the three are very different and should be considered carefully. Your budget will probably have the biggest effect on your choice. Comparing the three will help you make a good decision. New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience. While people have many expectations of planning and building their own houses, one thing is sure: it will take a while. There are always difficulties during construction, so you always find the construction time will be longer than your plan, not to mention the budget. Time can add up as well as materials and costs. Building is a good choice for those who are able and qualified. Question: What is the writer's purpose in writing this passage?

Solve g - 3*g - 10 = 0 for g.","output":"To solve the equation g - 3*g - 10 = 0 for g, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The given equation is g - 3*g - 10 = 0.  We have two terms with the variable g (g and -3*g).  Combine these terms by subtracting 3*g from g: g - 3*g = -2*g Now, replace this in the original equation: -2*g - 10 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To do this, we need to get g on one side of the equation and constants on the other side. We currently have -2*g - 10 = 0. To isolate g, first, add 10 to both sides of the equation: -2*g - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 -2*g = 10 Next, we need to remove the -2 coefficient from the variable g. Since the operation between -2 and g is multiplication, we need to perform the opposite operation, which is division. Divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*g) / -2 = 10 / -2 g = -5 Step 3: Verify the solution. Substitute the value we found for g back into the original equation to ensure it holds true: g - 3*g - 10 = 0 (-5) - 3*(-5) - 10 = 0 Perform the multiplication: -5 + 15 - 10 = 0 Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations in the order they appear: 10 = 10 Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is correct. The solution for the equation g - 3*g - 10 = 0 is g = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

There are altogether eight episodes  , all about history and culture of food, eating and cooking in China. The directors spent one year visiting more than 150 different parts of China. More than 300 types of food are covered in the documentary . As an old Chinese saying goes, food is what matters most to people. It plays an important role in our daily life, and the rich food culture is also one of the most important parts of Chinese culture. A Bite of China Season Two wants to show the joys and sadnesses of ordinary   Chinese in changing times through food. A Bite of China Season One was shown on CCTV in 2012. It attracted more than 100 million viewers. It is all about food, while the second season cares more about the relationship between the people and the food. For example, the first episode shows a young man spent four hours climbing a 40-metre-high tree to get something nice for his brother. The show reminds viewers of their homes and the tastes of childhood. One Weibo user wrote, \\"A Bite o f China Season Two makes me have so many words to say. It makes me think of my parents and my grandmother. I haven't been home for a long time, so I have decided to go back in a few days. \\" The show uses food as a window to introduce China to the world.

I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was forced to turn down a song since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single? , can you please find it?   Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

The part you mentioned is related to Daylight Saving Time (DST), but it doesn't tell us about the cities in Minnesota with different time schedules. So, the answer you're looking for is in 1965. Two cities in Minnesota, called St. Paul and Minneapolis, had different time schedules for a month. A time schedule tells us when a certain thing happens, like when to wake up or go to sleep. Because of this difference, people got confused, and later, both cities agreed to use the same time schedule. But what you mentioned is also interesting. It talks about a time in the 1980s when some big companies supported extending Daylight Saving Time. Daylight Saving Time is when we change our clocks to have more sunlight during the day.

Article: Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| The president speaking at the Oval Office—how tall is that door, though? NICHOLAS KAMM/Getty Images      White House physician Ronny Jackson gave a rundown of the president’s health Tuesday for the press corps. Unlike Trump’s previous checkup, described by personal physician Harold Bornstein in hilariously hyperbolic language, the numbers struck me as remarkably unremarkable. If someone read me these numbers, I’d conclude the patient in question was healthy. The blood tests and advanced imaging data reported are entirely objective measurements, and in this case they were largely within acceptable and healthy limits.      But one result was conspicuously abnormal: the president’s body mass index. At 6’3” and 239 pounds, Trump’s BMI is 29.9, exactly 0.1 units shy of one big league distinction: obesity. Remarkably, the president was found to be exactly 1 pound lighter than a weight that would have pushed him over the edge to receive the diagnosis of obesity. Similarly, if he were merely 1/10 of an inch shorter, he would also be considered obese.      Technically, BMI is also an objective measure—you plug in the numbers and see your result. But it can be gamed. The president could have fasted prior to being weighed, meaning that he would have stepped onto the scale while on the low end of an adult’s typical 2–4 pound daily variance and eked it out as merely “overweight.”      The more interesting question is the president’s height. The president has long maintained that he is 6’3”, which already observed as at least questionable if not demonstrably false. But further, he’s been reporting that height since at least the 1980s—strange because many, if not most, adults lose around an inch in height as the age from 30 to 70. When was the last time Trump was measured barefoot?      It’s striking that the sole aspect of the presidential physical in which the data can be massaged elicited results that place the president teetering on such a conspicuous and, for a man who seems to value optics so much, potentially embarrassing barrier. If the president is in fact obese, he should not be ashamed—he should own it and use his pulpit to inspire others to make healthier choices. But I’m afraid he’ll probably just keep reaching for those extra ice cream scoops.

But not everyone is buying Jackson's assessment that Trump is 6-foot-3 and weighs 239 pounds, giving him a barely sub-obesity body mass index (BMI) of 29.9. MSNBC's Chris Hayes came up with the name:      Has anyone coined \\"girther\\" for those who belive the president weighs more than his doctor reports? — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) January 16, 2018      The main argument seems to be that since muscle weighs more than fat, Trump can't possibly weigh the same as professional athletes of roughly the same build. One example of many:      Colin Kaepernick is 6'4 230            Trump is supposedly 6'3 235            Something isn't adding up. pic.twitter.com/AEBIwmbFsg — Matt Rogers (@Politidope) January 16, 2018      Sports Illustrated compiled many other Trump vs. athlete visual comparisons. Did the commander in chief order Jackson, a two-star Navy admiral, to tip the scales, so to speak? Some \\"girthers\\" are putting their money where their doubts are.      I will give 100 thousand dollars to Trump's favorite charity if he will step on an accurate scale with an impartial medical professional, okayed by both of us. For real. #Girther #GirtherMovement — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) January 17, 2018      Others doubt that Trump is actually 6-foot-3.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He... What job did Timothy Kaine likely enjoy the most? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Governor. - Attorney. - not enough information - Mayor. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which job Tim Kaine enjoyed the most. Although he has had numerous and diverse positions throughout his life, including serving as governor, attorney, and mayor, the text does not specify which role was his favorite or which one he enjoyed the most.

Capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be assumed to be linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and normal (i.e., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What causes the assumption of constant capacitance to fail even if the effect is linear in nature?","output":"The assumption of constant capacitance in a capacitor may fail even if the effect is linear in nature due to several reasons. Capacitance is ideally considered constant when a capacitor is subjected to a constant voltage or when the dielectric material between the plates remains unchanged. However, in reality, the capacitance value can be affected by various factors such as temperature, voltage, and frequency. 1. Temperature dependence: The capacitance of a capacitor can change with temperature, especially in certain dielectric materials. This temperature variation can lead to changes in the dielectric constant and the physical dimensions of the device, causing the capacitance to be non-constant. Although this effect may be linear over a certain temperature range, it invalidates the assumption of constant capacitance. 2. Voltage dependence: In some capacitors, the dielectric material's properties may change with the applied voltage, causing the capacitance value to vary as a function of voltage. This effect is particularly noticeable in ferroelectric materials, where the dielectric constant may exhibit strong non-linear dependence on the applied voltage. Even if the effect is linear, it still means that capacitance is not constant and varies with the voltage across the device. 3. Frequency dependence: The capacitance value can also change with the frequency of the applied voltage. This is mainly due to the frequency-dependent behavior of the dielectric material and the parasitic effects such as inherent inductance anddielectric losses in the capacitor. These frequency-dependent effects can lead to changes in the effective capacitance, even if the underlying behavior is linear. For example, at higher frequencies, the dielectric material may not fully polarize, resulting in lower effective capacitance. In summary, the assumption of constant capacitance can fail even if the effect is linear in nature due to various factors, such as temperature, voltage, and frequency. These dependencies result in non-constant capacitance values, invalidating the assumption and necessitating consideration of the changes in capacitance when analyzing real-world capacitors and circuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor was abandoned by his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations.

Mary Todd Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Love That Bound a Nation: Lincoln and Mary\\" Genre: Historical Drama/Romance Plot Summary:  The movie follows the poignant love story of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and Mary Todd, a beautiful and spirited woman with a penchant for politics. Set against the backdrop of a nation divided by the Civil War, the plot delves into the heart-wrenching personal and political challenges that this remarkable couple faced together, as they helped to shape the future of the United States. Act 1: The film opens in Chicago, Illinois, 1839. A young and ambitious lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, arrives at a lavish party hosted by the prestigious Edwards family. Here, he is introduced to their enchanting cousin, Mary Todd, a highly educated and outspoken young woman hailing from a well-to-do Kentucky family. As the night unfolds, Lincoln becomes increasingly enamored by Mary's wit, intelligence, and passion for politics, as they engage in spirited discussions about the future of the young nation. Meanwhile, doubts and disapproval begin to arise from Mary's family, who see Lincoln as a tall and gangly figure from a humble background, lacking the finesse and wealth necessary for a suitable match. Despite these challenges, Lincoln and Mary's bond only grows stronger as their love blossoms amid secret rendezvous and stolen glances. Act 2: As their courtship continues, Lincoln and Mary face increasing opposition, both from her family and from society at large. Lincoln's political foes seek to exploit their relationship, painting him as a man ruled by the whims of his eccentric and headstrong \\"southern belle.\\" However, their love survives these external pressures, and they ultimately marry in a modest, private ceremony in 1842. Following Lincoln's ascent to the Illinois state legislature and later to the U.S. Congress, Mary moves to Washington D.C., where she navigates the cutthroat world of high society and politics, often offering valuable insights and guidance to her husband's political career. The couple faces numerous personal hardships, including the tragic loss of their children and Mary's struggles with mental illness. Despite these challenges, Lincoln remains a devoted and loving husband, supporting Mary through her darkest days. Act 3: Amid the build-up to the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln and Mary find themselves at the forefront of a nation on the brink of war. As Lincoln takes his place as the 16th President of the United States, Mary assumes her role as First Lady, using her political acumen and charming demeanor to bolster support for her husband's controversial positions on slavery and the preservation of the Union.  As the Civil War rages on, the movie reaches its emotional climax. Mary, now hardened by her experiences and overwhelmed by the grave responsibilities of her position, watches as her husband navigates one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. In his fight for unity, the love between Lincoln and Mary remains a source of strength for the President and a beacon of hope for an entire nation. In a heart-wrenching final scene, viewers bear witness to the fateful night of April 14, 1865, when Mary and Lincoln attend a performance at Ford's Theatre – a night that would tragically end in the assassination of President Lincoln. As Mary grieves the loss of her beloved husband, the film concludes with a poignant montage of their lives together, reminding the audience that it was their love and resilience that bound them together, shaping the course of American history and paving the way for a more united nation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Al and Pete  for the following movie plot:  The film follows Troy (Erik Palladino) as he returns to Los Angeles from Miami to meet with his former partners: Al (Tyson Beckford) and Pete (Simon Rex), whom Troy betrayed years before.

Britain’s top law officer yesterday paved the way for new inquests to be held into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough. Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was taking the ‘exceptional’ step of applying to the High Court to have the original verdicts of accidental death quashed. His announcement came after a report into the 1989 disaster revealed last month that 41 fans could have been saved if the response of emergency services had been swifter. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the crush at the Hillsborough ground in Sheffield, but only this year has new evidence confirmed the need for fresh inquests. It also revealed a vast cover-up by. police and paramedics designed to blame Liverpool fans for the tragedy. Families of the victims hope new inquests will record verdicts of. corporate manslaughter. Mr Grieve said he was still. considering the new evidence, but would apply for fresh inquests to be. held on the basis of what he has already read. He said he was making the announcement early to ease the ‘anxiety’ of victims’ families. ‘My view is that I will apply to have. every one of those 96 inquests quashed,’ he told MPs. ‘I believe that. these deaths, arising as they do from a common chain of events, should. all be considered afresh.’ It was clear there were ‘significant. issues over the original inquest’, he added. But he admitted the new. legal process ‘will take some time’ and acknowledged that ‘the wait for. truth and justice has been long and unspeakably painful for a great many. people’. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he would go to the High Court to quash the original 96 inquests into the deaths of the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough tragedy. The report into the Hillsborough. disaster, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool, rejected the findings of. the original inquests that no lives could have been saved after 3.15pm. on the day. Pat Joynes, whose son Nicholas, 27,. was killed, said: ‘I’m highly delighted. We want the accidental death. verdicts quashed so we can get manslaughter verdicts. ‘I have spoken to different families. over the weekend. That seems to be the opinion and it is what I would. want as well – corporate manslaughter and manslaughter verdicts. ‘Ninety-six people can’t die and hundreds injured without someone being held responsible. ‘The truth, in my opinion, is finally. coming out, I’m very pleased. We want to see justice. If that means. police officers have to stand trial, well they should stand trial in a. criminal court.’ Mrs Joynes, who lives near St Helens, Merseyside, added that she hoped any new inquests would be held in Liverpool. Former Labour Justice Secretary Lord. Falconer, who has advised the victims’ families, said David Cameron had. made a ‘huge difference’ to the campaign. ‘You have a government, led by a. prime minister, saying, “This is a huge injustice, let’s sort it out” –. and that makes a real difference,’ he said. Liverpool MP Steve Rotheram said the. move ‘marks one of the biggest steps forward in the fight for justice. for the families in 23 years’. Liverpool fans have spent 23 years campaigning for justice, including new inquests into the events of April 15 1989. ‘The undeniable fact is that the. original inquest was unsound and this application, if successful, will. mean that evidence will be able to be heard after the 3.15pm cut off. imposed by the original coroner in the 1989 inquests,’ he added. ‘For the first time in over two. decades, all the evidence can now be reviewed into the disaster and. potentially a new verdict recorded on the death certificates of the. deceased. ‘At long last, the full horror of. Hillsborough will be on the public record alongside the names of the. people and the organisations that are accountable for what happened.’ He went on: ‘The families’ heartache. has been well documented but what is less well known is that some. families have refused to pick up the death certificates of their loved. ones who died on that day.’ Last month’s report concluded police. officers had tried to smear the dead by checking them for criminal. records and medics had tried to prove they were drunk. Hundreds of statements were doctored to remove criticism of the authorities. Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article talks about an important decision made by a man named Dominic Grieve, who works in the government as the Attorney General. He wanted to reopen some cases involving 96 people who died in a very sad event called the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, at a soccer stadium in Sheffield, England. The original decision said that the people died by accident, but new information showed that some lives could have been saved if the people who were supposed to help responded more quickly. Dominic Grieve is trying to help the families of the people who died get some answers and maybe change the decision about what happened. This new investigation will look at all the information and take some time, but it is an important step for the families to get the truth and justice they have been waiting for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the father of the girl that the workaholic wants his brother to marry?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A little bit of bleach can help kill any mold that may be growing in the bottle. Measure out about half a teaspoon of bleach, and pour it inside the bottle. Cool water helps bleach clean the bottle more effectively than warm or hot water. Pour water into the bottle up to its top line, and shake it to mix the solution together. If the mold is really bad, you may want to leave the solution in the bottle overnight to soak. Screw the cap on, and leave it until the next day. Sometimes just soaking the bottle will remove the mold, but in some cases, you may need to scrub to get all of the mold off.  Stick a dish or bottle brush in the bottle, and scrub the areas where there is mold. If there is any mold on the cap or threads, dip a rag or dish brush into the solution, and wipe it around the moldy parts. Pour out the bleach solution into a sink, and rinse with fresh water. If you are worried about ingesting bleach, you may want to rinse it again or put it through the dishwasher.

Caius is one of the three ancient leaders of the Volturi, the largest and most powerful coven of vampires ruling from Volterra, Italy. The Volturi is the dominant authority in the vampire world, enforcing the laws that govern all vampires to maintain secrecy and order. Caius, along with his fellow leaders Aro and Marcus, maintain a strict and aggressive stance on enforcing these laws. Caius is described as a ruthless and sadistic vampire, with distinctive pale skin and silky white hair. He is highly ambitious and often advocates for aggressive and violent approaches to deal with any perceived threats to the Volturi's power. Campbell Bower's portrayal of Caius is marked by his cold and calculating demeanor, projecting an air of menace and authority that expects absolute obedience from those around him. In the Breaking Dawn movies, Caius is keen on destroying the Cullen family for creating an alleged immortal child, which is a severe violation of vampire law. Jamie Campbell Bower's involvement in 'The Twilight Saga' began with 'New Moon' (2009), where he was first introduced as Caius Volturi, and he continued to play this role throughout the series in 'Eclipse' (2010) and 'Breaking Dawn Part 1' (2011) and 'Part 2' (2012).

Please answer the following question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard).

Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some mind-blowing facts about Vijay Mallya? What can Vijay Mallya do to make things right around him?","output":"These two questions do not have the same meaning, as they focus on different aspects of Vijay Mallya's life and actions. Let's analyze each question separately: 1. What are some mind-blowing facts about Vijay Mallya? This question is centered around seeking interesting, surprising, or astonishing facts about the Indian businessman Vijay Mallya. Mallya is best known for his ventures in the liquor, aviation, and sports industries. As an answer to this question, here are some such facts: - Vijay Mallya, often referred to as the \\"King of Good Times,\\" is the son of Indian entrepreneur Vittal Mallya, who was the Chairman of United Breweries (UB) Group. - He took over the reins of the UB Group at the young age of 28 after his father's passing in 1983. Under his leadership, the company became one of the largest spirits producers in the world, owning world-renowned brands such as Kingfisher and Whyte & Mackay. - Mallya was one of India's most flamboyant and high-profile businessmen and was known for his extravagant lifestyle, which included a private island in the Caribbean, a historic castle in Scotland, and a massive collection of luxury cars and yachts. - He was a member of India's Upper House of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, as an independent candidate from his home state of Karnataka, serving two terms from 2002 to 2008 and 2010 to 2016. - Mallya's airline venture, Kingfisher Airlines, was launched in 2005 and quickly gained popularity as a premier airline, offering unprecedented levels of luxury to Indian passengers. However, it suffered due to financial mismanagement and competition, and by 2012 had ceased operations with massive debt. - Vijay Mallya’s association with sports was prominent as he was the co-owner of the Formula One team Force India, which was later renamed Racing Point Force India, and a previous owner of the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Royal Challengers Bangalore. - Mallya got involved in legal trouble due to allegations of loan default amounting to around 1.3 billion, owed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines to a consortium of banks. Amid mounting pressure, he left India for the UK in March 2016 and has since been fighting extradition from Britain to India to face charges. 2. What can Vijay Mallya do to make things right around him? This question is centered around the actions and steps Vijay Mallya can take to redeem himself and rectify any problematic situations he may have been involved in. Here are some possible actions Mallya could take to make things right: - Acknowledge and accept responsibility for the problems caused by his businesses, especially the debt owed to the consortium of banks and unpaid salaries of former employees of Kingfisher Airlines. - Work on negotiating a settlement plan with the banks and other creditors to repay the debts, demonstrating a sincere commitment to resolving the financial issues at hand. - Proactively cooperate with Indian legal authorities, returning to the country to face the charges in a transparent and accountable manner, if required and permitted by the courts. - Rebuild trust with the employees, business partners, and shareholders who were affected by the failure of his companies, by maintaining open and honest communication and taking appropriate corrective actions. - Utilize his wealth, influence, and experience in a manner that contributes to the community, helping create opportunities for those less fortunate or investing in initiatives that support social and economic development. - Use his public image and connections to encourage responsible business practices, ethical financial management, and environmental sustainability within the industries he has been involved with. - Focus on personal growth, learning from the mistakes made in the past and working to rebuild his reputation by living a more accountable and responsible life, both in his business dealings and personal relationships. In summary, the first question asks for interesting and surprising facts about Vijay Mallya's life and career, while the second question explores the actions he can take to rectify his wrongdoings and rebuild his reputation. These questions, therefore, have distinct meanings, focusing on different aspects of Mallya's life and experiences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Britain's oldest man made his first visit to London yesterday at the age of 101. Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea. But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \\"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\\" he joked. Mr Evans, who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, almost made the journey to London once before, at the turn of the century. \\"There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea -- too much I thought. All my money went to the family then,\\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights. Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP, Mr. Gareth Wardell. The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired. \\"I don't like the chair -- people will think I am getting old. \\" he said. His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized -- no wine, no tobacco and no anger. Before setting off from Swansea with his 76-year-old son, Amwell, he said jokingly, \\"I'm glad to see they've given me a return ticket. \\" Question: The very reason that Mr. Evans didn't go to see the world is that   _  .

My task to respond to this question would involve sourcing information about the different technologies and designs employed in these notes to defend against forgery. 2. The second question \\"How safe is new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 Indian currency notes?\\" is broader.

This unique nine-digit number, assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), would help Randy in several key areas. Step 1: Research the importance of a FEIN Christopher knew that without a FEIN, Randy would face difficulties in managing his business's financial and legal matters. This identification number would allow Randy to separate his personal finances from his business finances, which is crucial for tax purposes and maintaining limited liability protection. Step 2: Evaluate Randy's business requirements Christopher evaluated the type and size of Randy's business, as well as the number of employees to determine if obtaining a FEIN was necessary. He discovered that, as Randy planned to hire employees and establish the company as a legal entity, acquiring a FEIN was essential. Step 3: Obtain necessary information and documents To properly apply for the FEIN, Christopher gathered all necessary information and documentation, including Randy's legal name, business address, social security number, the nature of the business, and an estimate of annual employee wages. Step 4: Choose the appropriate application method There are multiple ways to apply for a FEIN, including by mail, fax, or online. Christopher chose the online method for its convenience, faster processing time, and immediate receipt of the FEIN upon approval.  Step 5: Complete the online application Christopher guided Randy through the online application process on the IRS website. They patiently answered each question in the form, double-checking the information to ensure accuracy and completeness. Step 6: Submit the application and receive the FEIN Once they finished the application, Christopher helped Randy submit it. The process was smooth, and they received the FEIN shortly after submission. Christopher advised Randy to save the number securely, as it would be necessary for various business operations like tax filings, opening a business bank account, and applying for permits and licenses. Step 7: Update relevant business documents After obtaining the FEIN, Christopher reminded Randy to update all relevant business documents, such as contracts, invoices, and employer tax documents. This would ensure that the business would comply with federal regulations and operate smoothly. In conclusion, Christopher's expertise and support were instrumental in helping Randy obtain a federal employer identification number for his business.

Accelerate: Accelerate is a verb describing the action of increasing speed. It does not answer the question as it does not refer to an object.    d. Airplane: Although airplanes do have accelerators, they are not owned by most people due to their high cost, size, and the expertise required to operate them.    e. Car: Cars are widely owned by people as they are relatively affordable and convenient for daily use. Cars do have an accelerator, which is a crucial component for controlling their speed. 3.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals?, using the article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the..., what would be the answer ?

Summarize this article: The way players navigate the 3D levels in Sea Hero Quest will be anonymously tracked and sent to the researchers. Understanding how people navigate 3D environments is important because the skill is often one of the first lost by people who have dementia. Researchers say the game could generate an unprecedented amount of data. \\"We have never seen anything undertaken in dementia research at this scale before,\\" said Hilary Evans, chief executive at Alzheimer's Research UK, one of the organisations involved. \\"The largest spatial navigation study to date comprised fewer than 600 volunteers. \\"Providing the research community with access to an open-source data set of this nature, at this scale, in such a short period of time is exactly the kind of innovation required to unlock the next breakthrough in dementia research.\\" The free game was developed by the charity, researchers from University College London and the University of East Anglia, with the backing of communications giant Deutsche Telekom. Players follow a sailor's quest to revisit some of his father's memories, and battle fantastical sea creatures. The routes they take will generate global \\"heat maps\\" that will show researchers how people generally explore 3D environments. The ultimate goal is to develop new diagnostic tests that can detect when somebody's spatial navigation skills are failing. Researchers from UCL said the game generated useful data about 150 times faster than lab-based experiments. \\"In my research team, I could only test about 200 people a year, and that's working hard,\\" Dr Hugo Spiers, from UCL, told the BBC. \\"But last night I tested 200 people in one minute with this game.\\" Players can opt to reveal their gender, age and location to the researchers, although they can choose to take part completely anonymously. \\"This project provides an unprecedented chance to study how many thousands of people from different countries and cultures navigate space,\\" said Dr Spiers. \\"It's a massive online citizen science experiment that will give us an idea of what is 'normal' through this game. \\"If we tile that information together, we can get a sense of how dementia changes over a lifetime, and other demographic factors.\\" Dr Spiers stressed the game was not itself a test for dementia. \\"If you're worried about your memory or any changes to your health, speak to your GP,\\" he said.

Spain to Request EU Aid for Banks Spain said Saturday it would ask Europe for financial aid for its ailing banks, a step that would make it the fourth and largest euro-zone economy to require rescue funds from its euro-zone partners. Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos told a news conference that the European Union will grant Spain a loan of as much as €100 billion (125 billion) that the government will funnel to banks that need capital. Euro-zone finance ministers said they welcomed the Spanish step, saying the sum \\"must cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin.\\" Mr. de Guindos said, \\"The Spanish government is determined to do its best to protect the stability of the euro.\\" He added that the conditions attached to the loans \\"will be imposed to banks, not to Spanish society, nor to its fiscal or economic policy.\\" He added that \\"the figure seeks to dispel all doubts.\\" Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos says Madrid will ask for assistance for its troubled banks. Deborah Lutterbeck reports. Video courtesy of Reuters. The agreement came after days of talks between Spanish and European officials that culminated in a conference call among finance ministers Saturday afternoon, in which the framework for the support was agreed. European governments put intense pressure on Spain to agree to a support package for banks that have suffered in a real-estate crash—and ahead of Greek elections next weekend that they fear could send a new wave of turmoil through the region's financial markets. The talks extended as Spain tried to minimize conditions on the loans and to limit the role of the International Monetary Fund, officials said. Spain also strenuously sought to avoid the aid being depicted as a bailout like those provided to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, officials said. Luis de Guindos speaks Saturday in Madrid. The 17-nation euro zone is a collection of countries with vastly different economic profiles. See how they stack up on the major measures. The euro-zone ministers said the IMF has been invited to assist in the implementation and monitoring of the financial support to Spain \\"with regular reporting.\\" However, unlike Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Spain won't be asked to implement an extra austerity program beyond that it has already committed to. Unlike in these programs, the IMF won't provide funding for Spain. The IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said in a statement, \\"The IMF stands ready...to support the implementation and monitoring of this financial assistance through regular reporting.\\" She also welcomed the decision to backstop Spanish banks with euro-zone funds. In a report released late Friday, the IMF said it thought Spain's banks need an additional €37 billion in capital to cover losses in a deteriorating local economy. But it added they might need to raise much more than that—between €60 billion and €80 billion—to shore up investor confidence. A formal request by Spain is expected before June 21, when euro-zone finance ministers meet in Luxembourg and after a detailed report is issued by two government-appointed advisers on the banks' capital needs. \\"It was in everyone's interest to have the situation clarified before the Greek elections,\\" a European official said. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said it stood ready to swiftly play its role in the Spanish loan. \\"The Commission is ready to proceed swiftly with the necessary assessment on the ground, in close liaison with the [European Central Bank], the [European Banking Authority] and the IMF, and to propose appropriate conditionality for the financial sector,\\" Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and vice-president Olli Rehn said in a statement. Mr. de Guindos, Spain's finance minister, said the eventual request could be smaller than €100 billion. The ministers said the support would come either from the euro zone's temporary bailout fund or, as soon as it was operational in July, the permanent rescue vehicle, the European Stability Mechanism. \\"That figure is mostly for the markets and doesn't mean that the actual disbursements have to be that much,\\" one official said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble welcomed \\"the determination of the Spanish government to address the [bank] recapitalization.\\" \\"Spain is on the right track and Germany, as well as the other countries and institutions in the euro zone, and probably the IMF, will closely accompany and support Spain in its efforts to restructure the banking sector,\\" he said. Follow every article, blog post, video and tweet on the debt crisis from our reporters across Europe. Mr. de Guindos pointed out that the loans Spain will get from the funds will be \\"lower than market price.\\" Spain is now paying more than 6% for 10-year money. He said the loan will add to Spain's debt load. Officials said the government failed to secure a deal in which the bailout funds would directly inject capital into Spanish banks, thereby avoiding swelling Spanish government debt. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a statement Saturday, said the U.S. welcomed \\"Spain's action to recapitalize its banking system and the commitment by its European partners to provide support. These are important for the health of Spain's economy and as concrete steps on the path to financial union, which is vital to the resilience of the euro area.\\" Spanish and EU officials hope the bailout will allow the government to maintain market access to meet its own funding needs. If Spain were to lose market access for a prolonged length of time, the cost of supporting Spain—an economy twice the size of those of Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined—would be enormous. \\"It's a loan from Europe with extraordinarily favorable conditions and reduces the pressure on the Spanish treasury,\\" Mr. de Guindos said. The Eurogroup supports the efforts of the Spanish authorities to resolutely address the restructuring of its financial sector and it welcomes their intention to seek financial assistance from euro area member states to this effect. The Eurogroup has been informed that the Spanish authorities will present a formal request shortly and is willing to respond favourably to such a request. The financial assistance would be provided by the EFSF/ESM for recapitalisation of financial institutions. The loan will be scaled to provide an effective backstop covering for all possible capital requirements estimated by the diagnostic exercise which the Spanish authorities have commissioned to the external evaluators and the international auditors. The loan amount must cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin, estimated as summing up to €100 billion in total. Following the formal request, an assessment should be provided by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, EBA and the IMF, as well as a proposal for the necessary policy conditionality for the financial sector that shall accompany the assistance. The Eurogroup considers that the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB), acting as agent of the Spanish government, could receive the funds and channel them to the financial institutions concerned. The Spanish government will retain the full responsibility of the financial assistance and will sign the MoU. The Eurogroup notes that Spain has already implemented significant fiscal and labour market reforms and measures to strengthen the capital base of the Spanish banks. The Eurogroup is confident that Spain will honour its commitments under the excessive deficit procedure and with regard to structural reforms, with a view to correcting macroeconomic imbalances in the framework of the European semester. Progress in these areas will be closely and regularly reviewed also in parallel with the financial assistance. Beyond the determined implementation of these commitments, the Eurogroup considers that the policy conditionality of the financial assistance should be focused on specific reforms targeting the financial sector, including restructuring plans in line with EU state-aid rules and horizontal structural reforms of the domestic financial sector.

C.K.'s mother, an American with Irish ancestry, grew up on a farm in Michigan. She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis.  When C.K. was a year old, his family moved to his father's home country of Mexico, where his father had earned a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico prior to graduating from Harvard. C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after they moved back to the U.S. when he was seven that he began to learn English. He has said that he has since forgotten much of his Spanish. When C.K. left Mexico with his family, they moved back to the United States and settled in Boston.  Upon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, and George Carlin as some of his influences. When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much and when he remarried, C.K.'s father converted to Orthodox Judaism, the faith of his new wife. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts. The fact that his mother had only \\"bad\\" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion. C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Szekely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000-2003).  C.K. attended Newton North High School, and graduated in 1985. He graduated with future Friends star Matt LeBlanc. After graduation, C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston. According to C.K., working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. \\"Learning is my favorite thing\\", he said. He also worked for a time as a cook and in a video store. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How long did he live in mexico?","output":"C.K. lived in Mexico until he was seven years old.

On November 13, Soviet Russia renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and began the Soviet westward offensive of 1918-1919. The Bolsheviks followed retreating German troops and attacked Lithuania and Poland from the east trying to prevent their independence. They attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution, establish Soviet republics in the region, and join the German and the Hungarian Revolutions. The Soviet offensive sparked a series of local wars, including the Polish-Soviet War and the Lithuanian-Soviet War. At first, the Soviets were successful, but came to a halt in February 1919. In March-April both Lithuanians and Poles began their offensives against the Soviets. The three armies met in the Vilnius Region. Polish-Lithuanian relations at the time were not immediately hostile, but grew worse as each side refused to compromise. On April 19, 1919, the Polish Army captured Vilnius. At first, both Poles and Lithuanians cooperated against the Soviets, but soon the cooperation gave way to increasing hostility. Lithuania claimed neutrality in the Polish-Soviet War. As the Polish Army forced its way further into Lithuania, the first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8, 1919, near Vievis. Though there was no formal state of war and few casualties, by July newspapers reported increasing clashes between Poles and Lithuanians, primarily around the towns of Merkinė and Širvintos. Direct negotiations in Kaunas between May 28 and June 11, 1919, collapsed as neither side agreed to compromise. Lithuania tried to avoid direct military conflict and submitted its case for mediation to the Conference of Ambassadors.

A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Adult bigfins have never been captured or sampled but rare video footage recorded by the Shell Oil company reveals their alien-like behaviour. Scroll down for video. The giant squid, pictured, was caught on camera in the Gulf of Mexico. It has elastic tentacles thought to be 15 to 20 times longer than the squid's body and the total length is around 26ft. Its ten appendages are often held at right angles to the body, or mantle, which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Mangapinna squids were first discovered. in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage was filmed off the. coast of Brazil. A squid spotted in 2000 was thought to. have been around 23ft long and more recent sightings have estimated. lengths of 26ft. The arms and the tentacles of the. Mangapinna squid are the same length and look identical. These ten appendages are also often held at right angles to the body, or mantle,. which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Very little is known about the feeding behaviour of these squid. Scientists believe that bigfin squid feed by dragging their arms and tentacles along the seafloor, and grabbing organisms off the floor. They may however simply use a trapping technique, waiting passively for prey to bump into their arms. The footage was captured using a remotely operated underwater vehicle known as an ROV. Shell Oil, along with other companies, uses the vehicles to study the water around its oil rigs and this particular recording was filmed in the Gulf of Mexico in the Perdido Area of Alaminos Canyon. The rare sighting of the squid was discovered at a depth of more than 7,800 ft back in November 2007. Shell oil has a rig located 200 miles off the coast of Houston, Texas. Mangapinna squids were first discovered in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage of the bizarre creatures were caught on camera by a submersible off the coast of Brazil.

The majority of other sightings have been in  various canyons in the Gulf of Mexico. A. squid spotted in 2000 was thought to have been around 23ft long. However, more recent sightings have estimated lengths in excess of 26ft. Aside from their overall lengths, the. arms and the tentacles of the Mangapinna squid are the same length and. look identical.

The. arms and tentacles are said to stretch up to 20 times longer than the. mantle while the fins are larger than other species and in some. sightings were around 90 per cent as big.

John Kitzhaber witnessed a troubling scene on his way to dinner. Seeing a woman unconscious on the roadside, Governor Kitzhaber suspended his initial plans and wasted no time in rushing to her aid, according to a spokesperson quoted by The Oregonian. The governor, a former emergency room doctor, put his medical expertise to use immediately. The woman was not breathing, a possible victim of a heroin overdose, as later suggested by Kitzhaber's representative. Demonstrating the instinct and quick thinking his medical career demanded, Governor Kitzhaber ordered one of his guards to call for expert medical help. Always the doctor at heart, he started administering Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to the unconscious woman himself. With some luck and crucial medical intervention in the form of a defibrillator, the woman's heartbeat was restored before she was rushed to the hospital where she remains under intense care, and is favorable to survive as per a fire official. Following the incident, Governor Kitzhaber's office reached out with a heartfelt message to the local news channel KGW, \\"The governor wishes her well and hopes that she seeks treatment in order to avoid the bad situation she was faced with today.\\" Interestingly, this is not the first time that Kitzhaber has switched from his governor's role to a rescuer's role in of a blink of an eye.

Punctuating the given sentence correctly would yield: 1. Make a work with the idea about a certain place: real, fictitious, or virtual. Now that the punctuation is fixed, let's explore how to approach the task in a detailed manner. The creative process can be divided into multiple stages: 1. Select the type of work: Determine whether you will create a written work (short story, novel, poem, article, or essay), a visual work (painting, drawing, graphic novel, or illustration), or a digital creation (video game, virtual reality experience, or 3D model). Identifying the format of your project will help you focus on the most relevant aspects of your chosen location. 2. Choose your location: Pick the place that you want your work to focus on. This may be a real place, such as the Eiffel Tower or the Grand Canyon, a fictitious place, such as Middle-earth from J.R.R. Tolkien's novels or Westeros from George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, or a virtual place, like the world of Minecraft or the city of Los Santos from Grand Theft Auto. 3. Research: If you have chosen a real location, research its history, culture, architecture, and significant events that have occurred there. Include local customs, languages, and geographical features. If you are dealing with a fictitious or virtual location, study the source material and gather relevant information about the world-building elements, characters, and events. In-depth research will lend authenticity to your work and improve the reader's or viewer's immersion. 4. Brainstorm: Now that you have gathered information about your chosen location, turn your attention to the characters, plot, or visual elements for your work. Think about what kind of stories can be set in this place, any unique aspects of the environment that can inspire your visuals, or intriguing angle that would make your work engaging and compelling. 5. Create an outline: Regardless of the format, you chose, having a rough outline before diving into creating your work can be helpful. For written works, jot down a brief summary of the plot, character profiles, or key ideas to explore. For visual works, create thumbnails or sketch the main elements of the piece and think about which colors and techniques you will use to represent the location accurately. 6. Execution: Begin working on your creation, using your outline as a guide and referring to your research notes for accuracy and inspiration. Remember to edit, revise, and seek feedback from others to improve your work. 7. Finalize your work: Once you have completed your work, make any necessary revisions and finalize your piece. Share it with others and be proud of your accomplishment! By following these steps, you will be able to create an engaging work based on the concept of a certain place, whether it is real, fictitious, or virtual."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.  - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals .

Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals.  - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China.  - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa  but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\").  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.  - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances.  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems.  - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.  - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing.  - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\"  a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).  - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century.  - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

News article: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had mostly male DNA has given birth to twins.      Doctors have called the event a 'medical miracle' and said it is akin to a man giving birth.      The 32-year-old had an intersex condition, in which she had the physical appearance of a woman, but more than 95 per cent male chromosomes.      In humans, gender is determined by chromosomes. Women have XX chromosomes, while men have XY chromosomes.      Medical miracle: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had 95 per cent male DNA has given birth to twins. The woman, who was treated in Meirut, looked female but had mostly male XX chromosomes. She had never gone through puberty, had no ovaries and had never menstruated - but she did have an undeveloped womb      The woman, whose chromosomes were almost entirely XY, did not undergo puberty and had never menstruated.      It was discovered she had an intersex condition when she went to seek fertility treatment in order to become pregnant.      'When we investigated further we found that she had a very small vagina and an infantile uterus,' fertility specialist Dr Sunil Jindal said.      An infantile uterus is an undeveloped womb.      Doctors diagnosed her with XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function, the Times of India reports.      Ovaries are usually necessary for reproduction, as they create and release the eggs from which babies grow.      The lady underwent more than 12 months of hormonal and other medical treatment to develop her 'infantile uterus' and allow her to eventually conceive.      WHAT IS XY GONADAL DYSGENESIS? XY gonadal dysgenesis is a rare intersex condition in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function. It affects one in a million people. The chances of a person with this condition conceiving are very slim - and success is classed as a 'medical miracle', doctors said. There have only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world. 'It is akin to a male delivering twins,' a fertility expert said.      Her husband's sperm was used to fertilise a donor egg which was then implanted in the woman's uterus, which had been developed by the fertility treatment.      Once she became pregnant, doctors had to overcome another problem.      'Our biggest challenge was how to administer this pregnancy for nine months in a body not designed for it,' said Dr Anshu Jindal, medical director at Jindal Hospital, where the babies were delivered, told the Times of India.      On Friday she gave birth to a boy and girl.      'This is akin to a male delivering twins,' said Dr Jindal from the hospital in Meerut city, some 70 kilometres (43 miles) northeast of New Delhi.      Dr Jindal said his team of doctors discovered during their research that there had only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world.      'It's nothing short of a medical miracle. We are really happy that we could pull it off.'      He said the woman was startled to learn she had the condition, but was determined to undergo the treatment to get pregnant.      'Even she did not know she had this condition and was flabbergasted when we told her about it. But the husband was very supportive and told her \\"no matter what you continue to be my wife\\",' he said.      The babies were born through Caesarean section, weighing 2.25 kilos (4.9lb) 2.50 kilos (5.5 pounds) each. ||||| ‘Hunger Games’ star’s stunning critique: What if America loved black people as much as black culture?

Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

Definition: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

Available choices: (I). yes. (II). it is not possible to tell. (III). no.","output":"(I). yes. The given statement can be concluded as \\"The Senate run rumor is over, but satirists suggest that Clinton works at Wal-Mart\\" because it conveys the same idea: that the Senate run rumor is dead (meaning it's over), and a local satirical group is suggesting (humorously) that Clinton should work as a Wal-Mart greeter, using his known ability to connect with people. The other options are incorrect because the information available in the sentence makes the conclusion possible and clear: (II). it is not possible to tell - This is incorrect as the information given allows us to draw the conclusion.

As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made.

In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA.

Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. There is so many changes, that it wasn't really worthy of the Title. Character changes, plot changes, time line changes... First off who was Henry and the investigator? They weren't in the story. Henry had Mitch's persona somewhat, but Mitch wasn't a cop. No you made it so Roz, helped 'sink ' his body and used that as Zenia's blackmail against Roz. The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother. Her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story. Neither I don't believe was his lover, Roz's secretary. Tony and West were not together in the beginning. He was actually with Zenia first while in college. The black painted apartment was their Idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become fast friends. Tony hides her love for West. Then Zenia left west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony get together. Eventually marry, at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Only to be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now being a Professor at College she didn't want to let it get out. I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. Charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive. No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy. Augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war. Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis's nose while taking care of them both. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she OD'd. She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around.

The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.  The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans.

UPDATED:. 01:53 EST, 23 August 2012. Fifty Ways To Play: BDSM For Nice People is the surprise new release from HarperCollins. Just one year ago we would never have imagined that a mainstream publishing company like HarperCollins would dream of releasing a guide to bondage bedroom play - or BDSM, as it is known to the initiated. BDSM is a catch-all abbreviation that brings together the predilections for bondage and discipline (B/D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism or sadism and masochism. While it is a lifestyle choice enjoyed, sometimes to extremes, by people across the globe, it is fair to say that the current popularity of BDSM refers to a sort of 'BDSM lite' - a tamer, more approachable version of the sexual proclivity. And that is just what is portrayed in HarperCollins' new guide. The book, Fifty Ways To Play - which carries the subtitle BDSM for nice people. The publisher bills the book, by husband and wife duo Debra and Don Macleod as A Beginner's Guide To Unleashing Your Erotic Desires - and it is enough to have the more buttoned-up readers blushing into their blindfolds. Fifty Ways To Play claims to offer 50 'edgy and erotic' adventures which the publisher says are 'perfect for the millions of readers who have been inspired by the phenomenal Fifty Shades trilogy.' 'Fifty Shades has broken down the taboos about BDSM and more women than ever are wanting to spice up their sex lives,' HarperCollins said. 'But there is very little out there that shows you how to turn every night into an erotic fantasy. 'From turning your bedroom into a 'Red Room Of Desire [in the book it is known as the Red Room Of Pain] to exploring the fine art of Japanese rope bondage, these 50 edgy and erotic adventures make incredible sex incredibly easy,' they say. Conveniently for the budding BDSM-er, the book is being packaged up and sold as part of erotic gift sets by boxofgrey.com, a website set up for newcomers to the BDSM world. Fifty Ways To Play is being sold as part of luxury BDSM packages on website boxofgrey.com. They have created gift boxes with a selection of props to complement the book, with two different sets on offer to assist the BDSM virgins: the Play Box, which includes a blindfold, paddle, kegel balls and a rope kit, and the Summer Holiday box, which contains a holiday-friendly selection of products that the site says are discreet enough that they can be packed in hand luggage without arousing suspicions during security checks.

He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.  For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for...

The smell of gas is one of the best indications that you haven't successfully fixed a gas leak. While you might not always be able to smell a leak, you should pay attention to see if you do notice the smell of leaking gas.  Gas smells like Sulphur or “rotten eggs.” The smell of gas is made by mercaptan, an additive that is intended to help humans smell it. Shut off the master gas switch for your home and consider calling a professional if you smell gas. The gas main switch will be located next to your meter -- usually on the side of your home. Carbon monoxide detectors and gas detectors are normally used to alert people to gas leaks in their homes and businesses. While most detectors are stationary devices meant to detect an accumulation of carbon monoxide or other fumes, you can purchase portable detectors.  Position your stationary carbon monoxide detector near the repair you've made. If you have a portable detector, move it near (within several inches) to the repair. If there is a gas buildup near the detector, it will sound an alarm. This works because the detector solution or soapy water will bubble due to the force of the leaking gas. Ultimately, this is a simple and effective way to find out if you've successfully fixed a gas leak.  Commercially produced gas leak detector is specially formulated to stick to tight connections. If you want to create your own solution, try mixing a few drops of dish soap into a cup of water and spraying it onto the gas connection. If the solution bubbles, you likely failed to repair the leak. Gas detector may be available at your local home improvement store, specialty stores, or online.","output":"A one-sentence summary of this article: This article discusses the importance of detecting and fixing gas leaks through the use of smell, carbon monoxide detectors, portable gas detectors, and specialized gas leak detector solutions while offering advice on shutting off the master gas switch and seeking professional help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The MFP's \\"top pursuit man\\" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed Nightrider), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers chase the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max. Max pursues Nightrider in a high-speed chase which results in Nightrider's death in a fiery crash.

Johnny's drug-fueled rantings reveal him as a member of Nightrider's gang; Goose looks on Johnny with particular disdain, as his leg was broken during the Nightrider pursuit.

He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How is toodles appearance discribed?\\" is \\"Black and white with very floppy ears. He had short legs and big paws\\"?","output":"Yes, that's correct! In the paragraph, Toodles is described as a black and white dog with long floppy ears, short legs, and really big paws.

It's important to have such descriptors in a story as they enhance the reader's understanding of the characters and make the narrative more engaging and immersive.

This detailed description gives us an insight into the dog's physical traits and how they may impact the way he interacts with his surroundings, such as being agile enough to chase the ducks or having an expressive face to show his emotions after the duck bites his ear. Toodles is portrayed as a playful and curious character, as demonstrated by his love for playing fetch and his eagerness to interact with the ducks. His vulnerability and attachment to his owner are also evident when he runs back and curls up in their lap to seek comfort after being hurt by the duck. This characterization creates an empathetic connection between the reader and Toodles, generating an emotional investment in the story. Overall, the story effectively depicts Toodles in a detailed manner that paints a vivid mental image of his physical appearance and also gives us a glimpse of his personality traits and response to different situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Baghdad is under attack.Chief Roy Miller (Matt Damon) and his Mobile Exploitation Team (MET) are about to raid a site based on solid intelligence which has confirmed it as a site for chemical and biological WMD. Their job is to discover evidence of WMDs in Iraq, something the whole world and US is waiting anxiously for, as it is one of the sole reasons for the invasion. In their Humvees, they reach near the site where another army team, even though with a fairly large platoon, is unable to secure the place from civilian looters, who are grabbing and carrying anything they can get their hands on out of the site. Miller is trying to get his team into the site to deactivate and secure the WMD but is not given any assistance by the other team. It is very chaotic. They are told by the leader of the other team that there is a sniper holed up in the building site. After some tactical discussion, Miller and his team move in. They sniff out the sniper and take him down. After donning their masks and equipment, they survey the site in darkness, only to realize it was empty.

Question: Information:  - The Astra C was a 1912 French single engine biplane , manufactured by Société Astra at Villacoublay . In 1913 , the Astra CM Hydro - avion three - seat floatplane version was used to make the world 's first scheduled passenger - carrying flights .  - The Astra-Torres airships were non-rigid airships built by Société Astra to a design by Spaniard Leonardo Torres Quevedo in France between about 1908 and 1922. They had a highly-characteristic tri-lobed cross-section rather than the more usual circular cross-section. This was the result of moving most of the blimp's bracing wires inside the envelope in an attempt to minimise drag. Early Astra-Torres airships could be trimmed by moving the entire gondola fore-and-aft.  - Société Astra des Constructions Aéronautiques was a major French manufacturer of balloons, airships, and aeroplanes in the early 20th Century. It was founded in 1908 when Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe purchased Édouard Surcouf's workshops at Billancourt. Its most significant products were the Astra-Torres airships, but beginning in 1909, the firm also produced Wright brothers heavier-than-air designs under licence. In 1912, these were supplanted by Astra's own designs, the Astra C and CM.  - Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe (1846, Paris  1919) was a successful French petroleum businessman (known as the \\"Oil King of Europe\\") and an avid supporter of early aviation. He sponsored a number of prizes to encourage the development of aviation technologies, including the Grand Prix d'Aviation and the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize.  - The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871  January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867  May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.

That said the atmosphere has a lot of character being attached to a historic hotel, it has that vibe only an old building can have.  There are even some fun urban myths that go along with it.

To do this, we can add 32 to both sides of the equation: 8*p - 32 + 32 = 0 + 32 This simplifies to: 8*p = 32 Step 3: Solve for p Finally, we need to solve for p. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8: 8*p / 8 = 32 / 8 This simplifies to: p = 4 So, the solution to the equation -p + 9*p - 32 = 0 is p = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Understand the process of earthquakes The process of earthquakes involves the movement of plates on the Earth's crust, the exertion of force, the breaking of the crust, the release of energy, and the movement of energy in the form of waves, which are felt as earthquakes. Step 3: Determine the relevance of filter pores to earthquakes Smaller pores in a filter are not directly related to the geological processes that cause earthquakes. Filters typically apply to the context of fluid flow, such as filtering water or air, which does not have a direct impact on the formation of earthquakes.

A more detailed and appropriate answer could be: According to the Economic Survey of Delhi (2004-05), the State Domestic Product (SDP) of Delhi for that financial year stood at Rs. 1,11,886 crores at current prices. The data revealed that the economy of Delhi experienced a growth rate of 13.42% during 2004-05, which was notably higher than the national GDP growth rate during the same period. The encouraging figures were primarily the result of the tertiary, or services, sector that significantly contributed to the region's prosperity. This sector alone encompassed 79.94% of Delhi's SDP composition. Spectacular growth was observed in business services, financing, insurance, real estate, trade, hotels and restaurants, communication, and community, social and personal services industries. The primary sector, which includes agriculture, made a minor contribution of 0.83%, while the secondary sector, inclusive of manufacturing, electricity, and construction, held 19.23% of the SDP. In terms of per capita income, Delhi's population enjoyed notable advantages over the national average. The per capita SDP of Delhi at current prices surged to Rs. 74,816 in 2004-05, exceeding the corresponding all-India average Per Capita Net National Product (PCNNP), which stood at Rs. 23,241 during the same timeframe. This highlights the potential factors that contributed to the economic growth and prosperity of the metropolis. Delhi's economic boom in 2004-05 was facilitated by proactive government policies, an investment-friendly environment, and a talented workforce. As such, the SDP for 2004-05 serves as a key marker in understanding the capital's economic trajectory. In conclusion, the State Domestic Product of Delhi for the financial year 2004-05 was Rs. 1,11,886 crores with a growth rate of 13.42% and a per capita income of Rs. 74,816.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Because they may denuclearize - Because they have 20 million - Because they meet with Trump The answer is:","output":"Because they may denuclearize"},{"instruction":"Background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity.

Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman) (from the first Police Academy movie). It seems one of the two Police Academy schools is getting the axe, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure that Lassard's one screws up.The next day, after the governor's speech in which he will appoint a committee to evaluate which of the two schools should remain open, Mauser starts getting an edge by kissing up to the governor (offering the committee an escort, showing governor pages of useful tactics, etc.). Nearby, the elderly and slow-witted Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) gets an idea on how to win: along with now Sgt. Jones (Michael Winslow) and Lt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), he calls back his former class of '84 alumni misfits; Sgt. Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Sgt. Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Sgt. Tackleberry (David Graf) to the acdemy to help train the new recruits. Among the new recruits are Sgt.

Write highlights for this article: Global wine production is booming with vineyards springing up everywhere from China to the United States, Chile and New Zealand. But when a recent report authored by Morgan Stanley Research predicted a looming global wine shortage, vinophiles took to social media to express their dismay over the bleak news. The report stated that the international demand for wine outweighed production by 300 million cases in 2012 -- dropping to its lowest point in over 40 years. With worldwide consumption jumping by 1% last year, the researchers concluded demand could overtake supply in the coming years pushing the price of wine up. As the viticulture chaos ensued, France's International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) released their very own forecast report that countered Morgan Stanley's analysis. While Morgan Stanley's figures weren't incorrect, per se, their forecast did not take into account 2013's production levels which actually show a return to 2006 production levels, a healthy state of production for the industry. What's more -- Spain, Italy, France and Chile produced record wine levels in 2013. \\"It's how you interpret those figures. For all intents and purposes, for those of us in the West who are consumers, no -- there is not going to be a wine shortage,\\" says Felicity Carter, editor-in-chief of Meininger's Wine Business International magazine. \\"The question is whether there is going to be a wine shortage for consumers in markets that are extremely price sensitive -- like parts of Eastern Europe -- because the cheaper wine that they drink will be diverted to bulk up wine that goes into big consumption markets.\\" Carter echoes the OIV report pointing to the significant increase in production in EU countries like Croatia, Greece, Hungary and Romania and if vineyards from these areas could find stronger distribution avenues within the international market, there will be plentiful bottles to go around. With poor wine harvests in recent years thanks to erratic weather from climate change, Carter acknowledges this could impact wine production levels. While consumers are not going to see a drastic price difference when purchasing wine from supermarkets, she says it all depends on the region of wine. \\"The Burgundy harvest and the Bordeaux harvest this year have been abysmal ... If you wanted wine from the 2013 Burgundy or some parts of France, you're going to have a big problem. You will probably pay a lot more for those wines,\\" she explains. \\"The question is can you substitute other types of wine for those? Now, the answer is yes.\\" She adds: \\"Morgan Stanley, by the way, were not wrong in what they said. They did use very good figures and they do know what they are talking about but the world of wine is just so complex.\\" Highlights:","output":"1.

Question: Given the below context:  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.

Down went Larry McQuilliams, and so ended his rampage through the streets of the Texas capital, where he’d fired more than 100 rounds from his AK-47 and .22-caliber rifles at buildings. The shot, from Johnson’s Smith & Wesson M&P .40 pistol, hit McQuilliams square in the chest and made the 15-year-veteran the toast of gun enthusiasts around the country.      “At a minimum, it was extraordinary shot,” said Army Maj. John Plaster, a retired Special Forces operator, long-range shooting expert and author of “The Ultimate Sniper: An Advanced Training Manual for Military and Police Snipers.”      It was not immediately clear if Johnson’s center-mass shot killed McQuilliams, or if the longtime criminal died from a self-inflicted shot a moment later. Results from an autopsy are pending, but there’s no disputing the improbably accurate bullet fired by Johnson brought a safe end to the Nov. 28 incident.

(Smith and Wesson)      “It’s not impossible,” Plaster added. “Wild Bill Hickok shot bad guys from a hundred yards away with a handgun, but he was also a great shot.      “I would say what this officer did was phenomenal, especially if he didn’t brace his arm against anything.”      McQuilliams, 49, had multiple weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a map of 34 downtown buildings that likely were potential targets in his pre-dawn rampage the day after Thanksgiving, according to Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. He’d already shot up the Mexican consulate, the federal courthouse and a downtown bank.      “For a guy to keep his composure and holding two horses with one hand and taking a one-hand shot with the other hand, it says a lot about the training and professionalism of our police department,” Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said to the Austin American-Statesman.      Johnson, who works with the Mounted Patrol Unit, was about to get off duty and stabling the horses when he heard shots and returned fire at 2:33 a.m.      On Friday, Johnson, who is on routine administrative leave following the incident, made his first public appearance at a holiday charity event.

To do this, follow these steps: - Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol (about 1/4 inch deep) into a small container, such as a bottle cap or glass dish. - Remove the cap from the dried-out Sharpie pen. - Soak the pen's tip in the rubbing alcohol for about 10 minutes. This will help to soften the dried ink and re-saturate the tip with ink. - After soaking, gently dab the pen's tip on a paper towel to remove any excess alcohol and loose ink. - Test the pen on a piece of scrap paper to see if the ink flows properly. If it's still not working, repeat the soaking process. In some cases, you may need to soak the pen's tip for a longer duration or try another method. 2. Use a water-based solution: If you don't have access to rubbing alcohol, you can try a water-based solution to revive your dried-out Sharpie pen. This method may not be as effective as the rubbing alcohol method, but it can still be helpful in some cases. - Mix a solution with 70% water and 30% white vinegar in a small container. - Follow the same steps as mentioned above, soaking the pen's tip in the water-vinegar solution for about 10 minutes and testing the pen afterward.  3. Rehydrate using a wet paper towel: Another way to revive a dried Sharpie pen is by using a wet paper towel. This method can work well for both permanent and non-permanent Sharpie markers. - Dampen a paper towel with water until it is moist but not dripping wet. - Wrap the damp paper towel around the pen's tip and secure it with a rubber band or tape. - Leave the pen wrapped in the wet paper towel for a few hours or overnight to help rehydrate the pen's tip. - Remove the paper towel and test the pen on a piece of scrap paper. 4. Apply heat: A less popular but potentially effective way to revive a dried-out Sharpie pen is to apply heat to the tip. This method helps to soften the dried ink and make it flow more easily. - Hold the pen's tip near a source of heat, such as a hairdryer or warm air vent, for a few seconds. Be careful not to damage the pen or burn your fingers while doing this. - Test the pen on a piece of scrap paper to see if the heat loosened the ink. If not, try applying heat again for a longer duration or opt for one of the other techniques mentioned above. Remember that these methods may not work for every dried-out Sharpie pen, as their effectiveness can depend on various factors, such as the pen's age, the extent to which it's dried, or the type of ink used. However, using one or more of these techniques may increase your chances of reviving your Sharpie pen and getting it back to work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was the month of December and my parents were not at home. It was very cold and I was thinking of doing something that can raise my body temperature . Well, now I think I should have chosen doing exercise over porn . The mood was set, wi-fi speed was good and Google search was working. It took me half an hour to select a porn video. After selecting the video I downloaded it . WTF where are my earphones. Took 15 minutes to locate my earphones. The movie began and just after 5 seconds the door bell rang and this was where I got screwed when I forgot to minimize the movie. My parents were back home and I was back to my studies and just forgot about the movie. Now I have a habit that while I am studying I keep the phone in the next room. My mother was in the same room where the phone was. Now comes the worst part when my phone received a whatsapp message and my mother saw that message was dropped. Without giving any damm to my privacy she opened the phone and it was my bad luck that there was no screen lock. The movie automatically started and after 5 seconds she took the phone to my dad she said “This is what he is doing when he's alone” My parents called me what is this ??

Spiteful, ironic and human in turn, The Guard is an entertainment that makes most of the year's American comedies look impoverished, and in Gleeson it has a palpable star. 9.

Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations.  Which group had more serious mutations?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.","output":"Based on the provided information, Group A with germline mutations would have more serious mutations. The reasons for this are: 1. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells or gametes, which means they can be passed on to the next generation. This might lead to hereditary diseases. 2. If a zygote contains the germline mutation, every cell in the resultant organism will have the mutation, potentially causing severe developmental or health issues. 3. In contrast, somatic mutations found in Group B occur in body cells and do not get passed on to the offspring. While they may lead to conditions such as cancer, their impact is limited to the individual organism and does not affect future generations. Considering these factors, Group A with germline mutations is likely to have more serious consequences as these mutations can affect the offspring and potentially future generations, while somatic mutations are limited to the individual organism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 21 December 2011 the bank instituted a programme of making low-interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) and 1% interest to European banks accepting loans from the portfolio of the banks as collateral. Loans totalling €489.2 bn (US640 bn) were announced. The loans were not offered to European states, but government securities issued by European states would be acceptable collateral as would mortgage-backed securities and other commercial paper that can be demonstrated to be secure. The programme was announced on 8 December 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented. Under its LTRO it loaned €489bn to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent.

Movie title: The Last Legion Context: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain.

The hostilities were briefly stopped by horse plague. When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for Švitrigaila, who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites. In July 1435, Švitrigaila foiled a coup against him in Smolensk. Coup leader Orthodox bishop Gerasim, consecrated as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1432, was burned at the stake. The final battle, at Pabaiskas, was fought in September 1435 near Ukmergė , northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides. Švitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian-Polish army, led by Michael Žygimantaitis, and soundly defeated. Švitrigaila, with a small group of followers, managed to escape to Polotsk. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410. On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Peace of Brześć Kujawski showed that the Teutonic Knights had lost their universal missionary status. The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish-Lithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War , the civil war that would tear Prussia in half.

The Home Office has refused to comment on claims in the Observer newspaper that some children are being held in an immigration detention unit near Gatwick airport and others placed in foster care. The arrival of migrant children in the UK earlier this week prompted controversy in newspapers and criticism from Monmouth MP David Davies, with suggestions that some of them looked older than 18. He said migrants should have their teeth tested to verify their ages. The call was rejected by the government which pointed out such examinations have been described as \\"inaccurate, inappropriate and unethical\\" by dental experts. Chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Saira Grant, said the process to get children out of Calais had been \\"shambolic\\". She condemned the controversy over the ages, saying: \\"It creates an artificial distinction which suggests that all the others who fled war, atrocities and persecution are not worthy of our help because they are adults.\\" But UKIP leadership candidate Raheem Kassam said the government should publish records of the migrants allowed in to the UK. He told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: \\"We don't want their faces, we don't want their names attached to these things, but we can show these tests have been done.\\" Lord Dubs successfully campaigned for an amendment to the Immigration Bill in April allowing for unaccompanied child migrants to be brought to the UK where they do not have family links but are considered to be at risk.

These children are from other countries and have faced difficult situations. Some of them have families in the UK, while others don't but are considered vulnerable. Around 200 children from the camp have gone to the UK this week. The camp is set to close soon, and the people living there need to move. There have been some problems because some people still want to go to the UK instead of staying in France. The children that go to the UK need to be checked to make sure they are actually children. Some people have said that some of the children look older than 18, which has caused some disagreements. The main point is that these children need help, care, and a safe place to live."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Translate \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" to Czech?","output":"The sentence \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" translates to \\"Kde jsou děti, Mahira?\\" in Czech. Let's break down the translation: - \\"Where\\" translates to \\"Kde\\" in Czech. - \\"are\\" translates to \\"jsou\\" in Czech - it's a form of the verb \\"být\\" which means \\"to be\\". It's in the third person plural, which is used for \\"they\\" (\\"they are\\"). - \\"the kids\\" translates to \\"děti\\". The word \\"děti\\" is plural for \\"dítě\\", which means \\"child\\". In Czech, unlike in English, there's no need to use the definitive \\"the\\" in this sentence. - \\"Mahira\\" remains \\"Mahira\\". Proper names are typically not translated between languages. Therefore, when you put it all together, the sentence \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" translates to \\"Kde jsou děti, Mahira?\\" in Czech. It's worth noting that Czech follows a flexible word order due to its inflectional syntax. However, the translated sentence maintains the same order as the English one for a better understanding of the context in translation."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Fertilization of gametes products something that becomes what?\\" is Embryo. Fertilization is the process by which two gametes (sperm and egg cells) unite, forming a new organism with genetic material from both parents. Gametes are haploid cells, which means they contain only half the number of chromosomes as a typical body cell. When fertilization occurs, the sperm cell and the egg cell fuse, combining their genetic material to form a new cell, a diploid zygote. This zygote contains a complete set of chromosomes, half from each parent. The zygote then undergoes cell division, a process called mitosis, which causes it to grow and eventually become an embryo. An embryo is an early stage of development in a multicellular organism. Embryos can be found in plants and animals, including humans. As the embryo develops and grows, it undergoes various stages of differentiation and specialization, eventually forming all the different tissues, organs, and structures that make up a fully developed organism. In summary, the process of fertilization of gametes produces a diploid zygote, which undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo.

After watching him in action, I can see why people are making this comparison. Flanagan has a lot of potential and can definitely follow in my footsteps as a great full back. Here's a step-by-step process that Flanagan should follow in order to become a top player: 1. Develop physical attributes: Flanagan must continue to work on his strength, speed, and stamina to excel as a full back. He already has a strong presence on the field, brushing opponents aside, as seen against Juan Mata earlier this season. 2. Focus on defensive skills: Flanagan must constantly improve his tackling, positioning, and marking abilities. As a full back, defensive responsibilities should always be a priority. He should study top defenders and work closely with his coaches to hone these skills. 3. Improve on offensive contributions: A modern-day full back must contribute to the attack while also fulfilling their defensive duties. Flanagan should work on his crossing, passing, and dribbling techniques to provide valuable support for his team in the offensive phase. 4. Learn from experienced players: As a young player, Flanagan should make the most of learning from senior professionals both domestically and internationally. Playing for England and Liverpool puts him in a privileged position to receive advice from some of the best players and coaches in the world. 5. Gain experience: Participating in important matches and competitions, such as the Premier League, Champions League, and international tournaments, will give Flanagan valuable experience that can only enhance his progression as a player. 6. Maintain a strong work ethic: Flanagan should always remain committed to his development and never become complacent. The best players are constantly striving to improve and make the most of their talent. A strong work ethic combined with natural ability is a recipe for success. 7. Display perseverance and mental toughness: Injuries and setbacks are an inevitable part of a footballer's career. Flanagan must stay focused and determined during difficult moments, showing mental toughness and resilience to bounce back stronger. By following this step-by-step process and staying dedicated to his development, Jon Flanagan has the potential to become a great full back and one day be regarded as a worthy successor to the legendary Cafu."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Get a large plastic bucket or a wheelbarrow to use for making the venetian plaster.  Pour 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of lime putty into the bucket.","output":"Once you've poured 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of lime putty into the bucket, the next step would involve the addition of marble dust. Start by measuring a quantity of about 1 quart (approximately 0.95 liters) of marble dust. Please note that safety is essential, so ensure you're still wearing your facemask to avoid inhaling the marble dust. If your marble dust is in larger chunks, you'll need to grind it down to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle before adding it.  This is an important step because the marble dust acts as an aggregate, giving body and substance to the plaster. Without it, the plaster would lack the substance it needs for a good application. Slowly add it to the lime putty in your bucket or wheelbarrow and mix it thoroughly. Mixing can be done by hand using a mixing stick or an electric drill fitted with a mixing paddle. Make sure to distribute the marble dust evenly into the lime putty until the mixture has a uniform consistency. The next step would be adding colorants.  If you desire a colored Venetian plaster, this is when to add the colorant. It's best to use a colorant that's compatible with lime products. Mix the colorant into a small amount of water before pouring it into the plaster mixture. This will help distribute the color more evenly. Use as much colorant as recommended by the manufacturer or until desired shade is achieved. Continually mix until the color is evenly distributed. Furthermore, some people add a bit of natural soap during this step to increase workability and improve the texture of the Venetian plaster. This is optional but it could be beneficial especially for beginners. About 2 tablespoons of natural soap can be added to the mixture. After your plaster mix is ready, let it rest for a while; usually, an hour would do, some recommend leaving it for 12 to 24 hours for the components to blend well together. Once the wait is over, the Venetian plaster is ready for application. Using a stainless steel spatula or a trowel, you can apply the plaster onto the target surface. It is applied in thin layers and allowed to dry between coats. The number of layers applied depends on the desired effect but typically, 2-3 layers suffice. After application, the plaster needs to be polished to bring out the shine. This is done by vigorously rubbing it with a trowel. With it shining, leave the plaster to completely dry. The drying process might take several days, but the most important thing is to ensure your plaster is completely dry. After it completely dries, it's recommended to seal the plaster with a suitable water-based or oil-based sealer, that will protect the plaster from damage and enhance its durability, as Venetian plaster is somewhat porous and can absorb stains. Finally, cleaning the tools after finishing the job is also an essential step to take care of. Rinse the bucket, trowels, and any mixing tools with water immediately after use, this would avoid plaster remnants hardening thus, extending the lifespan of your tools.  It's important to remember that making and applying Venetian plaster is a hands-on job that would take a little practice to perfect, especially if you're doing colored plaster since colors may vary with each batch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which former MI5 secret service agent wrote the controversial book 'Spycatcher'????","output":"The controversial book \\"Spycatcher\\" which gave a detailed account of the inner workings of the MI5, British secret service agency, was written by Peter Wright, a former MI5 agent. \\"Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer\\" is the full title of the book which was first published in 1987. Peter Maurice Wright was born on August 9, 1916, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire and died April 27, 1995. He joined the British intelligence agency MI5 during the Second World War. Wright spent a significant length of his career in the MI5 and his main focus was on technical surveillance counter-measures, where he worked successfully on improving the technology aspects of the agency's operations. The book, \\"Spycatcher\\", caused a significant stir due to its explosive contents. The British government attempted to ban it, alleging that the book contained classified information. In this autobiography, Wright made a series of allegations such as the claim that Roger Hollis, a former MI5 director-general, was a Soviet agent. Such explosive claims created a storm of controversy both in the UK and internationally. \\"Spycatcher\\" was initially not published in the UK due to the government's injunctions on the grounds of breach of confidence, though it was published in Australia and other countries in 1987. The ban got lifted in the UK two years later only after the book had been widely available elsewhere. In \\"Spycatcher\\", Wright also detailed alleged actions of MI5, such as a plot to assassinate president Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Suez Crisis, and Operation Rafter, an operation to detect radio transmissions from secret Soviet spy locations. The legacy of the book was enduring; it prompted significant discussion about the rights and wrongs of government censorship, as well as the extent to which a country's own secret service should be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. It pushed the British government to spell out more clearly the previously unspoken Official Secrets Act. Hence, Peter Wright, through \\"Spycatcher\\", became a significant figure in intelligence literature and in public discussions about the role of intelligence agencies in democratic societies, even though his credibility was often contested due to the unverifiable nature of many of his claims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Two children are playing in the leaves. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different scenarios, even though they share some similarities. Let's break down the elements of each statement to understand why: The Premise: \\"Two laughing children play in the waves.\\" Here, we have the following components: 1. Two children: The number and the subject remain the same in both the premise and the hypothesis. 2. Laughing: The emotional state of the children, indicating their enjoyment in both cases. 3. Play: The action being performed by the children. 4. In the waves: The location, specifically close to a body of water or the sea/ocean, where there are waves. This setting implies that the children are enjoying some form of water-based activity in a natural setting. The Hypothesis: \\"Two children are playing in the leaves.\\" Now, let's analyze the hypothesis components: 1. Two children: Shared with the premise. 2. Are playing: The action being performed by the children, same as in the premise. 3. In the leaves: The location, which is markedly different from the premise. Here, the setting implies that the children are playing in or near a wooded or garden area, where leaves are present on the ground. To summarize: - Both the statements describe two children playing and enjoying themselves. - The emotional state of the children, \\"laughing,\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis but may be implied given the similarity to the premise. - The location and the setting are different in both cases: the premise has the children playing in the waves (presumably at a beach or near a large body of water), while the hypothesis has them playing in the leaves (likely in a wooded or outdoor area with trees). Given that these two statements describe different settings, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. It is entirely possible for two children to play and laugh on a beach, in the waves, while still not being true that they are playing in the leaves.

Article: An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  . The scientists implanted electrodes  --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee  or someone with a injury of spinal cord. The study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can \\"feel\\" with... Question: Monkeys tell researchers their sense of touch by   _  .

Other chicken dishes, in addition to tandoori chicken, use this masala, such as tikka or butter chicken, most of them Punjabi dishes. Meat other than chicken can be used, as can paneer (paneer tikka). is tandoori masala the same as tikka masala?","output":"To determine if tandoori masala is the same as tikka masala, let's compare the two types of masala, their ingredients, and usage: Step 1: Analyze Tandoori Masala - Tandoori masala is a spice blend used in tandoori-style cooking, which is popular in Indian cuisine. - It typically contains spices such as coriander, cumin, garlic powder, ginger, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, cardamom, and garam masala. - Tandoori masala is often used to marinate meats like chicken, which are then cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) or a regular oven. - As mentioned, tandoori masala is used in dishes like tandoori chicken, tikka dishes (such as chicken tikka), and even some paneer dishes (like paneer tikka). Step 2: Analyze Tikka Masala - Tikka masala, on the other hand, is a creamy tomato sauce used in Indian cuisine. - The sauce typically consists of tomatoes, cream, yogurt, onions, ginger, garlic, and a variety of spices, which may include some of the spices found in tandoori masala. - Tikka masala is often used in dishes like chicken tikka masala, where marinated and grilled/roasted pieces of chicken are added to the sauce. - It's important to note that while tikka masala is a sauce, tandoori masala is a spice blend. Based on the comparison, tandoori masala and tikka masala are not the same. While they share some similarities in terms of spices and usage in some Punjabi and Indian dishes, tandoori masala is a spice blend used for marinating and seasoning, whereas tikka masala is a creamy tomato-based sauce used in various curry dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I like the push button manual operation and you do not have to install any software for it to work and does not need an additional power adapter.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Some good news for online holiday shoppers: bargain-hunting binges   will drive prices down as web-based retailers compete to offer bigger discounts, marketing researchers predict. A recent survey by Shopzilla found that nearly 84 percent of online retailers would offer Cyber Monday discounts, up 12 percent from last year. Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says. Online stores will also pay attention to the deals their competitors are offering, potentially leading to price wars between certain retailers to attract all those potential bargain-hunting customers. Online shoppers can be divided into two types, Bohlmann said, --switchers and --loyals. Switchers compare prices between retailers and go for the cheapest one, while loyals stick to one brand or store. It almost doesn't matter what price you charge. Online retailers will look at the percentage of switchers and loyals they have in order to decide whether to offer discounts. The more switchers they have, the more likely they will offer discounts. But retailers don't just look at the percentage of their own customers; they also look at the competition. If one online store has a higher percentage of loyals than the competitor, it can afford to keep prices higher. On the contrary, if it has a higher percentage of switchers than the competitor, it might want to lower prices.

This can help to prevent overwhelming your esophagus with a lot of food at once and make it easier for you to digest your food properly. For example, you may have a small portion of food in the morning and then several small meals during the day, rather than a set breakfast, lunch, and dinner with larger portions. Food with lots of pepper and other spices can make your symptoms worse. Acidic foods like tomatoes, oranges, strawberries, and lemons can also cause spasms. Try cutting these foods out of your diet to see if your symptoms improve. Acidic drinks like coffee can also make your spasms worse so you should avoid drinking these, if possible. Try not to prepare food that is very hot or very cold, as the extreme temperatures can make your symptoms worse. Eat food at room temperature to avoid aggravating your esophagus. These two habits can make your symptoms worse and cause spasms to occur. Try quitting smoking or reducing how many cigarettes you smoke a day. Limit yourself to one to two drinks a month to prevent making your spasms worse. Esophageal spasms can become worse at night and make it difficult for you to sleep. To stop them, raise the head of your bed by using blocks under your bed frame or by placing a foam wedge under your mattress.  Do not try adding extra pillows under your head when you sleep, as this is not an effective option unless you buy a special pillow. You can purchase a special pillow that keeps you elevated. However, raising the bed, or investing in a bed that you can raise up, is a better option. Wait two to three hours after you eat to lie down in bed, to give your body time to digest your food and prevent spasms or heartburn. Keep these areas unrestricted by wearing clothing that is loose and flowy, such as tops that cut low at the neck. Go for clothing in breathable fabrics like cotton and linen to prevent these areas from getting too hot or tight. Losing even 5 to 8 pounds (2.3 to 3.6 kg) can make your esophageal spasms less severe and reduce their frequency. Try adopting a healthy, balanced diet and following a meal plan. Go to a fitness class at your local gym or workout at home using video tutorials online. Try walking, jogging, or biking to work every day to lose weight. These exercises can be done at work or at home in a quiet, low lit area. Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Try breathing in through your nose for a count of 5 and then exhaling through your nose for a count of 5. Do this for 2-5 minutes to help you relax and stay calm.

What is the answer?","output":"The name given to the silvery aureole enveloping the sun's chromosphere is the solar corona. The solar corona is the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, which extends millions of kilometers into space. It is composed of highly rarefied and ionized gas, primarily consisting of hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of other heavier elements. The corona is characterized by its extremely high temperatures, reaching up to several million degrees Kelvin, and by its faint, ethereal appearance, which can only be observed easily during a total solar eclipse or by using specialized telescopes equipped with a coronagraph. The solar corona plays a crucial role in the behavior and dynamics of the sun, as it is responsible for many of its most interesting and dynamic phenomena. Among these are solar flares, which are intense bursts of radiation and energetic particles emitted from the sun's surface, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which involve the expulsion of large quantities of plasma and magnetic fields from the corona into interplanetary space. Both solar flares and CMEs can have significant effects on Earth's magnetosphere and can lead to geomagnetic storms that can disrupt communications, navigation systems, and even power grids. The high temperatures of the solar corona remain one of the most intriguing questions in solar physics. Despite being farther from the solar core, the corona is much hotter compared to the photosphere (the sun's visible surface) which has temperatures around 5,500 degrees Kelvin. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain this temperature inversion, but several mechanisms are currently being investigated by researchers: 1. Magnetic reconnection: This phenomenon occurs when the sun's complex magnetic field lines break and reconnect, releasing large amounts of stored magnetic energy as heat and accelerating charged particles. This process can cause a rapid increase in the temperature of the surrounding plasma, contributing to heating the corona. 2. Wave heating: In this mechanism, waves generated by the turbulent motion of plasma in the sun's photosphere and convection zone transmit energy to the corona. These waves, including magneto-hydrodynamic waves and acoustic waves, dissipate their energy as heat in the corona, raising its temperature. 3. Nanoflares: These are small-scale, impulsive heating events resulting from the release of magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere. The continuous occurrence of numerous nanoflares may contribute to the heating of the corona. Understanding the solar corona is essential not only for advancing fundamental knowledge of the sun and its effects on Earth, but also for improving our ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of solar activity on our technological infrastructure and daily lives. This is why scientists continue to study the solar corona and related phenomena through ground-based observatories, space missions, and numerical simulations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Three men who are frequent users of pornography will be introduced to women who star in adult movies to see if they are able to distinguish between fantasy and real life. It is part of a new season of programmes for the station looking at the effect that porn is having on the nation and examining a more realistic view of British sex lives. Date My Porn Star will give porn obssessives the chance to date stars of adult movies to look at the realities of their lives. Pictured is a scene from the documentary. The programmes will also include documentaries about the effect on teenagers of being bombarded with sexual imagery and another which will help ordinary women to get more from their own sex lives. In one programme, Date My Porn Star, film-makers will take a trio of sex film fans to look into their views on the stars they meet, and also how the porn industry works. Channel 4 said it wanted to see 'if it is possible for them to relate to the stars as fully-formed people or whether their porn obsession has fundamentally altered their perception of the opposite sex'. In another programme in the Real Sex Season, called The Week the Women Came, a leading psychosexual therapist Trudy Hannington will try to improve sex lives for women who have struggled to orgasm or have lost their libido. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney will front another film - Porn On The Teenage Brain - to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on their lives and how they relate to people. Daubney famously resigned from the lads’ mag after an epiphany about the effect he felt that peddling soft porn was having on a generation. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney (pictured) will front another film to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on them.

Ralph Lee, head of factual at Channel 4 said: 'The aim of this season is to get a healthy perspective on sex.

The company grew to be a worldwide phenomenon over time with the success of its platinum performers such as Janet Jackson, Roy Orbison, Devo, Genesis, Keith Richards, the Human League, Culture Club, Simple Minds, Lenny Kravitz, dc Talk, the Smashing Pumpkins, Mike Oldfield, Spice Girls and more on their list of artists. It was later sold to Thorn EMI in 1992.  - Jay Sean (born Kamaljit Singh Jhooti; 26 March 1979) is a British singer and songwriter. He debuted in the UK's Asian Underground scene as a member of the Rishi Rich Project with \\"Dance with You\\", which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart in 2003. This led to him being signed to Virgin Records and having two UK top 10 hits as a solo artist in 2004: \\"Eyes On You\\" at No. 6 and \\"Stolen\\" at #4. They were included in his critically acclaimed debut album \\"Me Against Myself\\" which, though only moderately successful in the UK, sold more than two million copies across Asia and remains his most successful album to date. Alongside the Rishi Rich Project, Sean was a pioneer of Bhangra-R&B fusion, which his debut album helped popularize among the worldwide South Asian diaspora.  - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014.  - Rishpal Singh Rekhi better known by his stage name Rishi Rich is an English Indian music producer born in Croydon, England and based in London. He began his career in the Asian Underground scene and later became internationally known for his Bhangra tracks, his Hindi remixes, and as a pioneer of Indian-R&B fusion music.  - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush.

The first well-known mention was the compilation album \\"Anokha - Soundz of the Asian Underground\\" released in 1997 and masterminded by Talvin Singh and Sweety Kapoor. It is not a strict musical genre \\"per se\\", since the specific sounds can vary wildly (from Cornershop's Bollywood-influenced Britpop to Panjabi MCs' bhangra-influenced jungle).

So let's get away the 72 by subtracting 72 from both sides: 0 - 72 = 12*u + 72 - 72. This gives us: -72 = 12*u. Now, we have 12 pieces of something, and they together make -72. To find out one piece, we just divide -72 by 12. So: u = -72 ÷ 12. When we divide -72 by 12, we get: u = -6.

Question: Sunscreens   can offer protection from two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays  : UVB, which according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, are the chief cause of sunburn and play a key role in the development of skin cancer, and UVA, which get through the skin more deeply and are largely responsible for skin aging and wrinkling, as well as skin cancer risk. The SPF   measurement on sunscreens refers to the UVB protection level -- and the number may not mean what you think it does. SPF 15 doesn't protect you from 15% of UVB rays, just as SPF 100 doesn't protect you from 100% of the rays. In fact, as you get into the higher numbered SPF sunscreens (think: 50 and above), the difference in UVB protection is actually pretty small. Theoretically, though the increase in UVB protection with a super-high SPF sunscreen may be not worth considering, it may help, and certainly can't hurt, to use it -- that is, as long as you do so correctly. \\"The only _ is whether you're giving yourself a sense of false security,\\" Dr. Gohara says. Indeed, as Dr. Wang also pointed out, when people choose increased SPFs, they may actually feel so protected by the product that they finally ignore proper sun protection. \\"When people use really high SPF products, they tend not to reuse, they tend to stay out in the sun much longer, and they don't use other protective measures such as clothing and hats,\\" he says. Regardless of any increase in protection that a high SPF may or may not offer, one thing is certain: It doesn't give your body a free pass from sunburns, aging, or cancers, and it doesn't protect you from those things for any greater length of time than the lower SPF options. Both Dr. Wang and Dr. Gohara emphasized that, no matter what the SPF is, it's important to reapply your sunscreen every two hours. Why are we advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours? A) We choose too low SPF products. B) The higher SPF can make us stay outside longer. C) Clothing and hats are not enough for sun protection. D) It can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns or cancers. Answer:","output":"D) We are advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours because it can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns, or cancers. No matter the SPF level, sunscreen's effectiveness diminishes over time due to various factors, such as sweating, swimming, and rubbing. Regular reapplication ensures continuous protection from harmful UV rays and prevents these issues from wearing down the sunscreen layer."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I retired last year and was a substitute teacher this last school year. In June a teacher I had just subbed for a half day needed emergency surgery and I was asked to go in and finish her year. Good thing it was in an area I knew…English and Social at the grade 9 level. The kids were pretty good…some were a handful but most of them were very accommodating. They were also writing important provincial exams at the end of the year and were getting stressed out about it. As I was getting them ready to write their exam, I took a few moments to thank them for welcoming me into their classroom and making my job…while not easy….at least a rewarding experience. One boy who seemed to complain about everything….thanked me for taking ownership and preparing them for final exams. I had recognized that his argumentative nature was his way of dealing with stress and tried not to let it affect my teaching. That mostly worked. There was a time when I told him, quite loudly, that if he had spent his time getting ready to do assignments instead of arguing…he could have been finished days ago. He just nodded his head and got to work. It was a nice gesture that he was able to thank me for doing my job….that he recognized that some things were out of his control and to just get on with it. A life lesson that I am still learning, by the way. Every day lately, I have had something nice happen to me with my students. I am feeling blessed.

Answer:","output":"The owner of the Grand National legend Red Rum was Noel Le Mare. Born on December 5, 1911, in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, as Noel Saint George Le Mare, he was a successful businessman, engineer, and racehorse owner.  Noel Le Mare's connection to Red Rum began when he, together with racehorse trainer Ginger McCain, bought the horse for 6,000 guineas (equivalent to approximately £6,300) in the early 1970s. Red Rum, a thoroughbred racehorse, was foaled on May 3, 1965, and was a bay gelding sired by Quorum and out of the dam Mared. Originally, Red Rum was bred to be a sprinter, but his career took a turn when he joined forces with Ginger McCain and Noel Le Mare. Under the ownership of Noel Le Mare and the training of Ginger McCain, Red Rum went on to secure his place as a legendary racehorse by winning three Grand National races at Aintree in 1973, 1974, and 1977. He also finished second in 1975 and 1976, showcasing his immense racing talent and consistency. Red Rum remains the only horse to have ever achieved this impressive feat and holds an almost cult-like status in the world of horse racing. His 1973 Grand National victory was particularly memorable, as he came from 30 lengths behind to win the race in a record-breaking time of 9 minutes and 1.9 seconds. This victory, along with his other impressive performances at the Grand National, helped cement Red Rum's position as one of the greatest racehorses in history, and by extension, brought significant recognition and fame to his owner, Noel Le Mare, and trainer, Ginger McCain. Noel Le Mare experienced great success in his business and horse racing ventures, enabling him to fund Red Rum's career and provide Ginger McCain with the necessary resources to prepare the horse for each race. Le Mare passed away in September 1998, at the age of 86, but his legacy in British horse racing has endured through the remarkable story of Red Rum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Set-off (law). Yes or no? Answer: In certain jurisdictions (including the UK), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. Question: what is right to set off payments A:","output":"Yes, your statement is correct. In certain jurisdictions, including the UK, set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. To provide more context, the right to set off payments refers to the legal right that allows one party (creditor) to cancel or reduce the amount owed to them by another party (debtor) by applying it against a debt owed by the creditor to the debtor. In simpler terms, it is a method of mutual debt adjustment where two parties can offset their outstanding debts against each other, ultimately reducing the overall debt burden for both. In the case of insolvency, set-off can be an effective way to manage the risk of non-payment, as it allows the outstanding debts between the insolvent company and its creditors to be offset and cleared to some extent. This is particularly important for preventing further losses for creditors. In the United Kingdom, when a company becomes insolvent, the \\"rule in Cherry v Boultbee\\" operates, which leads to the automatic set-off of mutual and reciprocal debts between the insolvent company and its creditors. This rule applies to liquidations, bankruptcies, and administrations, ensuring that the outstanding debts are calculated using a fair and equitable process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. The domestic dog is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists. The dog was the first domesticated species. Context_2 : The domestication of animals is the mutual relationship between animals with the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction. Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domesticated species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits. There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. Context_3 : Capsicum pubescens is a species of the genus \\"Capsicum\\" (pepper), known in Peru as rocoto (Quechua, rukutu, ruqutu), locoto in Bolivia & Argentina (Aymara, 'luqutu') and as the \\"Manzano\\" pepper in Mexico which means \\"apple\\" for its apple-shaped fruit. This species is found primarily in Central and South America, and is known only in cultivation. The species name, \\"pubescens\\", means hairy, which refers to the hairy leaves of this pepper. The hairiness of the leaves, along with the black seeds, distinguish this species from others. As they reach a relatively advanced age and the roots lignify quickly, sometimes they are called tree chili. Of all the domesticated species of peppers, this is the least widespread and systematically furthest away from all others. It is reproductively isolated from other species of the genus \\"Capsicum\\". A very notable feature of this species is its ability to withstand cooler temperatures than other cultivated pepper plants, although it cannot withstand frost. Context_4 : Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. Context_5 : The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Context_6 : Cucurbita fraterna, also known as Cucurbita pepo\\" subsp. \\"fraterna, is a mesophyte plant species of the genus \\"Cucurbita\\". It is native to Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, Mexico. It has not been domesticated. It is the progenitor and nearest relative of the domesticated species \\"Cucurbita pepo\\" and wild \\"C. pepo\\" is still found in the same areas as \\"C. fraterna\\". It was formally described by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1943, in \\"Gentes Herbarum\\". Context_7 : Jane Hamilton-Merritt (born Mary Jane LaRowe, 1937), in Noble County, Indiana is a retired college professor, photojournalist, author, and animal rights and animal husbandry advocate. She resides in Redding, Connecticut. In 1999, she was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. Some of her work has focused on breeding and raising Llamas and Alpaca. Context_8 : Domesticated species and the human populations that domesticate them are typified by a mutualistic relationship of interdependence, in which humans have over thousands of years modified the genomics of domesticated species. Genomics is the study of the structure, content, and evolution of genomes, or the entire genetic information of organisms. Domestication is the process by which humans alter the morphology and genes of targeted organisms by selecting for desirable traits. Context_9 : Emmer wheat, also known as farro especially in Italy, or hulled wheat, is a type of awned wheat. Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). The domesticated species are \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccum\\" and \\"Triticum turgidum \\"conv.\\" durum\\". The wild species is called \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccoides\\". The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened seed head of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain. Context_10 : An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance. fact_1 : Jane Hamilton-Merritt (born Mary Jane LaRowe, 1937), in Noble County, Indiana is a retired college professor, photojournalist, author, and animal rights and animal husbandry advocate. fact_2 :  Some of her work has focused on breeding and raising Llamas and Alpaca. fact_3 : An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid.

He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. Context: In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.  Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \\"almost-forgotten\\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \\"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart.\\" The film earned approximately Rs214 million (US3.3 million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut.  Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \\"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned Rs370 million (US5.7 million) domestically. Question: What was Ranveer's next role? Answer:","output":"Ranveer's next role was in the movie Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, where he played a conman named Ricky Bahl. He had to pretend to be different people, like Sunny, Deven, and Iqbal, to trick girls. But in the end, he met someone who was not easy to fool. Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma, and Aditi Sharma were also in the movie with him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down each step to see if there is any direct connection between the increased water transport to leaves and the recycling of more aluminum cans. Step 1: A can is thrown away into a recycling bin. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as it primarily depends on human behavior and recycling habits. Step 2: The can is taken to a recycling center. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as this process is also unrelated to plant activity. Step 3: Melted down along with other cans. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as the melting of cans is a physical process unrelated to plant water transport. Step 4: The melted metal is turned into bars. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as it is still a separate process from plant activities. Step 5: Becomes material for other products. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step directly. However, it might have an indirect effect if the aluminum produced from recycling is used to manufacture products related to plant growth, irrigation systems, or other agriculture-related sectors.
