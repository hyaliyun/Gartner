Help as much as you can. Information:  - Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed...  - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with...  - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of...  - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over  8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma .  - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:  - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to...  - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile.  - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the...  - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\".  - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more...  - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.  - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if...  - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in...  - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life.  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%.  - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as...  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States...  - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About...  - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000...  - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your answer? Which of these is a nonliving thing? Choose from:  (1). a mushroom.  (2). a tree.  (3). a worm.  (4). a river.","output":"Option (4), a river, is the nonliving thing among the choices provided. To gain a deeper understanding, it's essential to differentiate between living and nonliving things with respect to their features and characteristics. (1) A mushroom: Although they may not resemble other traditional living organisms such as plants or animals, mushrooms are indeed alive. They are classified as fungi, which is its own separate kingdom different from plants, animals, and bacteria. Fungi obtain nutrients by breaking down and consuming dead organic matter, playing a crucial role in the decomposition process. Unlike plants, they lack chlorophyll and cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis. However, they exhibit other characteristics of living organisms, such as growing, cellular organization, and the ability to respond to stimuli. (2) A tree: Trees belong to the plant kingdom and are living organisms. They possess all the characteristics of living beings, such as growth, reproduction, cellular organization, metabolism, and response to stimuli. Trees also produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis, which involves converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Furthermore, trees have a vital role in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, thus contributing to the maintenance of earth's ecosystem. (3) A worm: Worms are considered living organisms belonging to the animal kingdom. They are multicellular invertebrates with a simple body structure, typically long and cylindrical. Worms possess specialized cells for various life functions such as digestion, excretion, and reproduction. They exhibit movement and the ability to respond to their environment, finding food and escaping from predators. Different types of worms, like earthworms, play a crucial role in improving soil quality by breaking down dead organic matter, aerating the soil, and enhancing soil fertility. (4) A river: A river is a nonliving thing, as it is a body of flowing water and lacks the characteristics and features of a living organism. Rivers have a significant role in shaping the earth's surface, providing habitats for various living organisms, and serving as essential sources of water. They are formed through constant movement of water due to gravity, which causes water to flow from higher elevations to lower elevations. The cycle of water in a river is influenced by various factors like precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, and human activities. Although rivers host numerous living organisms such as fish, plants, and microorganisms, they themselves are not considered alive."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is.

Being a food enthusiast, I was eager to give it a try. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. In this review, I will provide a detailed account of the issues I encountered at the restaurant. Firstly, despite having booked a table in advance, we were kept waiting for 25 minutes past our reservation time. The hostess explained that they were experiencing an unusually busy night, but a simple apology would have sufficed to acknowledge our inconvenience. Once we were seated, the restaurant was too noisy and overcrowded, making it difficult to hold a conversation with my companions without raising our voices. Given that this restaurant is supposed to be one of the more upscale options in town, I was shocked by how uncomfortable the atmosphere and seating arrangements were. When it came time to place our orders, the server seemed hurried and inattentive. We asked for recommendations, but she appeared disinterested and merely pointed out the most popular dishes without providing much insight into the ingredients or preparation styles. It felt as though she was trying to rush us through the ordering process. The food itself was underwhelming. I ordered the chef's special grilled fish, which was supposed to be prepared with a special herb-infused marinade. However, the dish turned out to be dry, overcooked, and lacking in flavor. I noticed that the presentation of our dishes was also lackluster, with the plates looking haphazard and hastily assembled. Additionally, the prices at XYZ Restaurant are quite steep, considering the quality of food and service we received. I would have been happy to pay a premium price for a truly exceptional dining experience, but, in this case, I felt like the cost did not justify the product. To make matters worse, the service remained inconsistent throughout the evening. Our server was slow to refill our water glasses, and we had to ask multiple times for additional napkins and utensils. When the time came to request the bill, we were met with further delays. Overall, I cannot recommend XYZ Restaurant based on my recent visit. The numerous issues we experienced with service, food quality, ambiance, and pricing sadly overshadowed any positive aspects the restaurant may have had. I sincerely hope that the management takes notice of these issues and works on improving the customer experience in the future. Until then, I will be looking for better dining options elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The English Premier League, known for its international draw of star players, lucrative television rights, and loyal fan base, has attracted various American billionaires who made their fortunes with sports franchises in the United States. In recent years, these investors have expanded their global portfolios by acquiring ownership stakes in major teams such as Manchester United, owned by Malcolm Glazer, Liverpool, owned by Hicks and Gillett, and Aston Villa, owned by Randy Lerner. Stan Kroenke, owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, and Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids, may soon join this elite group of American investors in English football. This development follows the news that a major shareholder at London-based Arsenal is considering selling her stake in the club, which could provide an opportunity for Kroenke to increase his ownership and involvement in the English Premier League. While these American investors have been successful in expanding their sports empires, it is important to examine the financial impact of their investments on the clubs they have acquired. In the case of the Glazer family, who obtained ownership of Manchester United, their acquisition of the club saddled it with a significant debt. The most recent accounts show that Manchester United is more than 1 billion in debt as a result. This situation highlights the potential risks and consequences of foreign investment on football clubs. While the infusion of capital can certainly help boost a club's financial resources, enabling it to attract top talent and enhance its performance, it is crucial to ensure that the long-term financial stability of the clubs is maintained. This balance ultimately impacts not only the owners and their investments but also the clubs' dedicated fans who have supported them throughout the years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase .  - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins.  - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes.  - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time.  - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps.  - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era.  - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.  - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F.  - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\".  - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth).  - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline.  - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.  - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.

Two islands were located in the Pacific Ocean. Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). The answer to this question is:","output":"Mud Island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters, as it had no such problems like earthquakes that are mentioned for Woo Island. As described in the hint, earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and when stresses build too much, the rocks break, releasing the energy that was stored in them. This sudden release of energy creates an earthquake, during which rocks typically move several centimeters or, more rarely, a few meters. Since Woo Island is frequently shaken by earthquakes, rocks there tend to move more often and with greater displacement compared to Mud Island, which does not face earthquake issues.

(As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together). However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (using the expression \\"in the doghouse\\" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives, to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.

General Sees Possible Cut in Troops in Iraq WASHINGTON, June 11  The top American commander in Iraq said today that United States forces in Iraq could be gradually reduced this year if the new Iraqi government made steady progress and the Iraqi Army gained in self-sufficiency. But the commander, General George W Casey Jr., did not go as far as a top Iraqi security official, who predicted today that the numbers of American troops in Iraq could fall this year from the current 130,000 to perhaps 100,000. General Casey also said that he was not surprised that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia had issued new threats following the death of its leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on Wednesday in an air raid north of Baghdad. An Internet message attributed to the group warned of \\"great operations to shake the enemy.\\" Speaking of Mr. Zarqawi's death, General Casey said, \\"It's not going to stop terrorism across Iraq, but it is a major blow both to his network and to Al Qaeda.\\" General Casey appeared on three Sunday morning news programs  all of which were broadcast before the Iraqi security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, predicted the troop cuts on CNN  and he carried a cautiously upbeat message about Mr. Zarqawi's death and its impact on his group of mostly foreign militants. \\"They are hurt badly,\\" he said. \\"But again, you can't stop terrorist attacks completely.\\" General Casey told \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that American-led forces were conducting follow-up raids informed by intelligence gathered as the coalition moved in on Mr. Zarqawi, and apparently also by names and phone numbers on computers found in the rubble of the remote house where he died. Mr. Rubaie also said Mr. Zarqawi's death could have a galvanizing effect. He predicted a splintering of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a particularly brutal group that had intimidated many Iraqis into shunning political participation. As long as the national unity government and Iraqi security forces continue to make progress, \\"I think we're going to be able to see continued gradual reductions of coalition forces over the coming months and into next year,\\" the general said on the CBS News program \\"Face the Nation.\\" General Casey noted that the Iraqi government is poised to announce a new plan to improve security around Baghdad. General Casey spoke a day before President Bush was to begin intensive consultations  on Monday with his own advisers at his Camp David retreat, and on Tuesday with the new Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki via video hookup  on strategies to bolster the Iraqi government and tangibly improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis. General Casey said he did not plan to ask Mr. Bush for more troops, but he declined to say whether he would urge any cutbacks. Bush administration officials have played down the prospect that the strategy sessions would lead to quick troop reductions. Iraqi officials like Mr. Rubaie have at times made more optimistic troop projections than those offered by American officials, who say instead that any withdrawal will depend on conditions in Iraq and the ability of Iraqi security forces to operate largely without the support of the American-led coalition. Still, congressmen seized on Mr. Rubaie's statement as offering hope. \\"That's an authoritative statement,\\" Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on CNN. \\"I think we ought to do everything we can to hold them to it.\\" But a Democratic senator, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, added a caution. \\"The reality in Iraq,\\" he said, also on CNN, \\"is that the jihadists are just a small portion of the instability.\\" Mr. Rubaie predicted that Mr. Zarqawi's death would have a \\"huge\\" impact, as Iraqis began feeling safe to take part in the political process. He also confirmed the American account of events around the militant's death. General Casey, asked about a report that one witness claimed to have seen soldiers beating a critically wounded Mr. Zarqawi, dismissed them bluntly as \\"baloney.\\" Like Mr. Rubaie, he said American troops sought to minister aid to the injured Qaeda leader, but added that it was too late. \\"He died while American soldiers were attempting to save his life,\\" General Casey said.

In Babylonian astronomy, records of the motions of the stars, planets, and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was \\"the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.\\" According to the historian A. Aaboe, \\"all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.\\" Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who wrote on the clay tablets in Babylonian astronomy?","output":"The clay tablets in Babylonian astronomy were written by scribes.

These services often include massages, skin treatments, facial treatments, body treatments, manicures, pedicures, hair styling, and possibly other wellness and beauty services. Spa companies can range in size and scope from small local businesses to large luxury resorts that cover multiple acres. The term \\"spa\\" was originally used to refer to a place where water that is believed to have special health-giving properties was present, often in the form of hot springs or therapeutic mineral waters. However, as the wellness industry has evolved, the term has come to refer to any place that provides services meant to help the client relax, rejuvenate, beautify, or improve their physical well-being. Spa services can often include treatments from licensed professionals such as estheticians, massage therapists, and cosmetologists, who provide their services in a calm, relaxing and generally luxurious environment designed to help clients feel at ease. The word La Perla in \\"La Perla Spa\\" is Spanish and translates to \\"The Pearl\\" in English. It suggests that the company aims to provide a luxurious, precious and unique experience to its clients, one which can be compared to the beauty and rarity of a pearl.

Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL.

This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine).

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Edwin John Ellis was a scholar.  Available options: 1). Yes. 2). It's impossible to say. 3). No.","output":"2). It's impossible to say. While the provided paragraph does not explicitly use the term \\"scholar\\" to describe Edwin John Ellis, it does indicate that he was a British poet and illustrator, and participated in the editing of a three-volume collection of the works of William Blake, along with W.B. Yeats. This implies that he had some level of familiarity with and interest in literature, specifically in William Blake's works. The paragraph also mentions that this collection is criticized for weak scholarship and preconceptions. This criticism could be reflecting on either Ellis, Yeats, or both of them. Given this information, one could argue that Ellis might not be considered a scholar in the traditional sense due to the criticisms, or that these criticisms simply refer to this specific work, while his other works or achievements are not mentioned.

Q: Question: Sarah leaves coconut oil on the counter during the night when it is cool, and it is a solid. During the day, the coconut oil is a liquid, so the day is   Answer: warmer A:","output":"The question tells us that Sarah leaves coconut oil on the counter during the night, and at that time, it is in a solid state. During the day, the coconut oil turns into a liquid state. The answer is \\"warmer,\\" which means that the daytime temperature is higher than the nighttime temperature, causing the coconut oil to change from solid to liquid. Explanation: Coconut oil has a melting point of around 76°F (24°C). When the temperature is below this point, coconut oil remains solid. When the temperature rises above the melting point, the coconut oil turns into a liquid. In this situation, the fact that the oil is solid at night and liquid during the day indicates that the daytime temperature is warmer than the nighttime temperature. This higher temperature during the day is what causes the coconut oil to change from a solid to a liquid state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the context of a movie review, it can indicate that the movie was able to convey its intended message or impact the audience in the intended way.

Available choices: A. no B. yes","output":"A. No These two questions do not have the same meaning as they are addressing entirely different topics.  The first question, \\"How do I kiss Emma Watson?\\" is an inquiry about the specific action of kissing the British actress Emma Watson. This question likely comes from a position of personal curiosity or fantasy and has no broader context. It is important to note that such a question may not be appropriate, as it might be perceived as invading Emma Watson's privacy, and consent should always be prioritized. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Should Emma Watson spend a week in a refugee camp?\\" is a proposal about the actress's potential involvement in an immersive experience with displaced people. This question implies a broader context, perhaps considering her record as a public advocate for social and humanitarian causes, like gender equality and education. Emma Watson's visit to a refugee camp could potentially help raise awareness about the issues refugees face, making it a question focused on activism and empathy. In summary, these questions are not similar in meaning. One is focused on a personal desire to engage in an intimate act with the actress, while the other is about her potential to raise awareness and understanding of a global issue through direct involvement with the subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are presented with the question \\"What can be heard through the ear?\\" and the following answer choices:  - matter vibrating  - encoded information  - mean thoughts  - absence of noise  - ear drums  - in the frog family  - electromagnetic energy  - the body's largest organ  Now knowing that matter vibrating can cause sound and words are only gross sounds heard through the ear, choose the best answer.","output":"The best answer choice for the given question \\"What can be heard through the ear?\\" is \\"matter vibrating\\". This is because the sensation of hearing fundamentally relies on the vibrations of matter, such as air molecules, which then transmit these vibrations to our auditory system through the ear. The process begins when a source of sound creates vibrations that travel through a medium, most commonly air. These vibrations are called sound waves and are detected by our ear system. The outer ear is specifically designed to capture sound waves and guide them through the ear canal, which then causes the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations then continue through the middle ear, where they are transmitted by a series of tiny bones called ossicles, which amplify the vibrations and transmit them to the inner ear. In the inner ear, the cochlea transforms the mechanical vibrations into electrical impulses, which are sent along the auditory nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as sounds. To provide clarity to the other answer choices: - Encoded information refers to a form of coded data or signal, which is not what the ear directly perceives; it can only become audible if there is some form of matter vibrating. - Mean thoughts, although they require our ears to hear and our brain to process, only exist on an abstract level and cannot be directly transmitted as sound. - Absence of noise is not something the ear can specifically hear; rather, it represents the lack of sound or an environment devoid of vibrations. - Ear drums are involved in the hearing process but are not by themselves audible to an individual. - In the frog family is irrelevant to the question since it's not related to what can be heard through the ear. - Electromagnetic energy refers to energy in the form of photons or electromagnetic waves, which is not detected by the ear but instead by other sensory receptors, such as our eyes. - The body's largest organ refers to the skin, which is unrelated to this question as the skin is not responsible for the sense of hearing. Taking all this into account, matter vibrating is the most accurate, logical, and comprehensive answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, he must race against time to decode the encrypted secrets buried within him and thwart the dark forces that threaten not just his career but the fate of the world. Act 1: Cristiano Ronaldo, a global soccer icon, leads his team to another spectacular victory. As a customary celebration, his friends and teammates organize a lavish dinner in his honor. Little does he know that an undercover agent from a clandestine organization infiltrates the party with a devious plan: implant a top-secret, highly-sophisticated chip-device into Ronaldo's food in an attempt to smuggle sensitive intelligence across international borders undetected. As fate would have it, Ronaldo swallows the tiny device, completely unaware of the magnitude of the scheme now resting in his stomach. Act 2: Days later, Ronaldo begins to experience unexplained symptoms like dizziness, migraines, and fainting spells, ultimately resulting in unwanted attention from the press and a potential threat to his flourishing sports career. Worried about his health, he consults a doctor who, after finding the chip in an X-ray, contacts his close friend and cyber-security expert, Dr. Maria Alves. Together, Maria and Ronaldo learn the hard truth: an elite criminal syndicate is behind the dangerous embedded device. Believing Ronaldo would be nothing more than a courier, the shadowy organization, known as \\"The Scarlets,\\" now sets its sights on retrieving the chip – a feat only possible if Ronaldo loses his life in the process. As word comes that The Scarlets have put a bounty on his head, the pair sets out on a quest to uncover the device's secrets, which appear to hold the key to a malicious plot capable of destabilizing nations and overthrowing world leaders. Act 3: With Dr. Maria Alves' tech prowess, profound knowledge of espionage, and her ability to decipher encrypted data, the duo understands the chilling reality that The Scarlets are planning a synchronized, global cyber-attack dubbed \\"Project Ragnarok.\\" Ronaldo, now more than just a sports icon, becomes an unlikely hero, using his celebrity status and connections to infiltrate the criminal underworld. The pair discovers hidden ties that connect The Scarlets to high-ranking officials in various world governments, exposing the depth of the conspiracy. Disquietingly, Ronaldo now faces the ultimate decision – prioritizing his prosperous career or subjecting himself to a dangerous and unorthodox surgery to remove the chip and save humanity. In the thrilling finale, Ronaldo decides to sacrifice his sports career, braving the risky surgery to extract the chip from his abdomen. With time running out and the imminent cyber-attack looming closer, Maria utilizes the information decrypted from the chip, dismantling Project Ragnarok and foiling The Scarlets' evil aspirations. Epilogue: With \\"The Ronaldo Uprising\\" successfully contained, what was once a simple dinner party to commemorate an unparalleled sports legend becomes a whirlwind, global adventure that sees Ronaldo defy the odds and rise above challenges both personal and professional, pausing the world-renowned athlete's lifelong devotion to the beautiful game. Unafraid, Ronaldo embraces his new role as a valiant defender of humanity, proving that true heroes walk among us – even on the soccer field."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Given the following context:  The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&M Studios in Los Angeles: \\"It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.\\" The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year.

And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it.\\"      \\"All this is just so new,\\" said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. \\"I did not have much time to talk with him.

He had been researching Somali pirates.      \\"As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture,\\" Todd said. \\"But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause.

Muse said he did not know if a ransom was paid.      In lawless Somalia, it's common -- particularly among pirates -- that people are kidnapped and their freedom negotiated for ransom.

German officials received Moore, who worked for SPIEGEL International years before his abduction, on Tuesday afternoon local time.      Germany's Foreign Ministry confirmed \\"that a German citizen, who also possesses American citizenship and who was kidnapped in Somalia, was freed today.\\" Moore, 45, is said to be in good condition considering the circumstances, security officials said. They said that he was overjoyed to be free.      On Tuesday, Moore arrived in the Somali capital in a small airplane and was taken to a safe place for a medical and psychological examination.      Moore was abducted in January 2012 in the Somali city of Galkayo, where he was doing research for a book on piracy. In the ensuing years of his captivity, his kidnappers released periodic photos of Moore.      The Foreign Ministry's crisis team together with American officials worked intensively to secure Moore's release during the length of his captivity. Several different negotiators were involved over the two-and-a-half year period.      Following Moore's release, SPIEGEL Editor-in-Chief Wolfgang Büchner thanked all those involved in working on behalf of the journalist during his captivity. \\"We never gave up hope and are now rejoicing with Michael and his family that this nightmare has finally come to an end,\\" Büchner said in Hamburg.      \\"We're grateful to all the people who have worked so long to bring about Michael's release -- and thrilled that he and his family can be reunited at last,\\" said Jon Sawyer, executive director of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

Michael Scott Moore was \\"doing well\\" and receiving medical care, Germany's Foreign Ministry said.      Moore, 45, was flown to Kenya's capital after being freed in Somalia on Tuesday. A special German Foreign Ministry crisis group and German federal police had worked \\"very closely\\" with U.S. authorities to win Moore's freedom after he was kidnapped on Jan. 21, 2012, while researching a book on piracy, foreign ministry spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli told The Associated Press in Berlin.      \\"Given the circumstances, he's doing well,\\" Chebli said.      She would not comment on what led to his release or on reports that a ransom had been paid, beyond saying \\"the German government cannot be blackmailed.\\"      The Somali pirates negotiated with Somali intermediaries acting on behalf of Germany, Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the coastal town of Hobyo, told AP. He said pirates grew tired of holding Moore and were increasingly concerned the U.S. would attempt to use force to secure the journalist's freedom.      Just four days after Moore was kidnapped in the northern Somali town of Galkayo as he was driving from the airport, U.S. Navy SEALs rescued an American and a Dane in a nighttime raid while killing all nine of their guards. The two had also been kidnapped in Galkayo, on Oct. 25, 2011.      Moore had freelanced for Germany's Der Spiegel. He holds both German and American citizenship and is a native of Redondo Beach, California      Chebli said Moore was at the German Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Wednesday.

As an academic field, philosophy of education is \\"the philosophical study of education and its problems (...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy\\". \\"The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.\\" As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive, and/or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"):  What does not define philosophy education?","output":"To approach this question, let's break down some aspects that are not central to defining philosophy of education: 1. Specific content or subject matter: Philosophy of education is not restricted to particular content or a specific subject matter. It tends to focus on the broader aims and methods of education, rather than prescribing a set curriculum. 2. Fixed methodology: While the study of philosophy of education does involve philosophical methods, it is not bound to a single methodology. It can draw from various areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology, as well as employing speculative, prescriptive, and/or analytic approaches. 3. Exclusive focus on outcomes: Philosophy of education is not defined solely by the results or outcomes of the educational process. Although outcomes can be a subject of study within the field, the philosophy of education also encompasses questions about the values, norms, and processes that drive education. 4.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective? ?  The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the...

'Couple': This word is significant because it sets up the subject of the sentence. Without a clear understanding of who or what the 'couple' is, we lose context and the sentence does not make sense. The word 'couple' could refer to two individuals in a romantic relationship, two friends, or even two objects, depending on the context. It carries relational information and applies a societal, emotional, or relational perspective. 2. 'Light': This word is significant because it conveys a particular image or concept, depending on interpretation. 'Light' is often associated with hope, inspiration, guidance or direction, and discovery. It contributes significantly to the symbolic nature of the sentence. 3. 'End of the tunnel': This phrase is a conventional metaphor meaning the conclusion of a difficult or dark period, generally associated with seeing a positive outcome or solution after a tough time or struggle. No other words in this sentence carry as much contextual and symbolic meaning as 'end of the tunnel.' It sets the scene and harnesses a lot of the emotional content. Each of these words or phrases brings a significant amount of meaning to the sentence, making them the most important. The 'couple' gives us the characters involved, the 'light' gives us a sense of what these characters are moving toward or experiencing, and the 'end of the tunnel' sets up the metaphorical or literal journey and struggle they have been/are going through. Without these key words, the sentence could have a drastically different meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  Two friends had a sleepover. They spent most of the time online looking up stuff and talking about it. Bill looked up the Gaia hypothesis, while Frank read about the Flat Earth theory.  Which friend read less about the composition of our atmosphere?

A researcher takes a photograph of the bird.. (IV). A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird..","output":"Of the given options, the best evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still present would be (III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird. Here's a detailed analysis of each option: (I) A bird watcher makes a sketch of the bird: While a bird watcher's sketch may provide some evidence that the bird might still exist, this is not a particularly strong or reliable form of evidence. Sketches can be influenced by personal interpretations and may not accurately represent the bird in question. Moreover, sketches cannot be verified through additional sources or technological means as photographs or video recordings can. Consequently, while intriguing, a sketch would likely not hold up as strong evidence to disprove the bird's extinction. (II) A scientist discovers fossil remains of the bird: Fossils can provide valuable information about the history of a species, including its distribution, morphology, and environmental context. Fossils can also help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between different species. However, discovering fossil remains of the bird would not disprove its extinction claim, since fossils are remnants from the past rather than current evidence of a living population. Instead, finding fossil remains would serve to validate the existence of the species but would not confirm the presence of living individuals in modern times. (III) A researcher takes a photograph of the bird: A photograph, taken by a researcher and supplemented by other supporting documents such as GPS coordinates and date-stamped metadata, would provide the most compelling evidence that the bird species still exists. A clear, unambiguous photograph, validated by experts in the field, could be considered definitive proof that the bird is not extinct. A photograph can capture specific morphological features that are critical for identification and can be more easily scrutinized and verified by specialists in ornithology to establish the presence of the bird. Moreover, photographs provide a relatively standardized and unambiguous form of visual documentation that can be shared and analyzed among different experts and institutions. (IV) A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird: The existence of suitable habitat for a particular bird species is an essential factor for its survival. While it is positive news that a park ranger finds such a habitat, this alone does not provide direct evidence that the bird still exists. In fact, the bird's extinction, while still having its ideal habitat, could be due to other factors such as disease, predation, or human-induced habitat destruction in other areas. The presence of a suitable habitat may suggest the potential for reintroducing a bird species through conservation and restoration efforts. However, without any direct sighting or recorded evidence of the bird, the claim of its extinction cannot be effectively disproven. In conclusion, the strongest evidence to disprove the claim that a bird species considered extinct since the 1900s is still alive would be a clear, unequivocal photograph of the bird taken by a researcher, accompanied by additional documentation to support the sighting's credibility. This would provide a reliable, verifiable basis for asserting that the bird is still present in modern times and can refute the earlier claim of its extinction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the merchant paid a 7% import tax on the portion of the total value of the item in excess of 1,000, we have the following equation: 0.07 (x - 1,000) = 109.20 Now, we can solve for x: 0.07 (x - 1,000) = 109.20 x - 1,000 = 109.20 / 0.07 x - 1,000 = 1,560 x = 1,560 + 1,000 x = 2,560 So, the total value of the item is 2,560.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy? is inside the article: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club., can you guess it ?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What great bog was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322? , can you please find it?   Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base... A:","output":"The great bog that was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322 is Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog situated in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, England. Covering approximately 10.6 square miles, it forms part of the larger Manchester Mosses that make up the western edge of the South Lancashire Plain. The name Chat Moss may have originated from St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia. However, considering that it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word 'ced', meaning 'wood'. Another possibility is that the name derives from 'Ceatta', an Old English personal name, and 'mos', a swamp. Alternatively, the first element could be the Old English 'ceat', meaning a piece of wet ground. The bog was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. In the local dialect, 'moss' refers to a peat bog. Noted British writer Daniel Defoe visited Chat Moss in 1724 while traveling from Warrington to Manchester. He described the bog as a \\"black and dirty\\" surface that could not bear the weight of either horse or man, except during exceedingly dry seasons. Despite its seemingly inhospitable nature, the peat within Chat Moss was used as fuel by the poor cottagers living nearby. In the 16th century, during the reign of King Henry VIII, another British writer, John Leland, documented a major event where Chat Moss burst its boundaries following heavy rainfall. This incident destroyed much of the surrounding ground, including freshwater fish populations, by polluting the nearby Glasebrook and Mersey rivers with its stinking water and rolling moss. The moss eventually reached the shores of Wales, the Isle of Man, and even Ireland. The construction of the famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 presented a significant challenge due to the difficult task of providing a solid base on Chat Moss. Renowned engineer George Stephenson managed to overcome this challenge by laying a unique foundation of heather and branches, followed by a bed of stones and crushed rock, which supported the railway track and distributed its weight over the unstable bog. In summary, Chat Moss is the great bog that was recorded to have the name Chatmos in 1322. Its name may have originated from several possible sources, and it has had a significant impact on the local environment throughout its history. The construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway across it was a remarkable engineering feat of the 19th century, highlighting the importance of this vast, challenging, and historically significant peat bog."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass Here is a hypothesis: All the trees and plants are coming out Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to better understand how they relate and why the conclusion can be drawn. Premise: \\"yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass\\" This statement presents an observation and refers to the fact that trees, plants, and grass are emerging or growing, possibly due to seasonal changes. The phrase \\"thank goodness\\" adds an element of relief, leading us to assume that this occurrence is welcome or anticipated. Hypothesis: \\"All the trees and plants are coming out\\" This hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, stating that the trees and plants are emerging or growing. Now, let's examine how these two statements relate and if it's possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. 1. Both the premise and hypothesis mention the same central idea - trees and plants are emerging or growing. The premise includes the additional element of grass, but this doesn't contradict the hypothesis as grass is just another type of plant. 2. The premise being true means that the person making the statement has observed the trees, plants and grass emerging or growing, and feels relieved about it. This observation directly supports the hypothesis, which simply states that trees and plants are coming out. Taking these aspects into account, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This conclusion arises from the fact that the central idea of both premise and hypothesis involves trees and plants coming out, and that the premise's truth reinforces the direct observation of the phenomena described in the hypothesis. Consequently, if the premise holds true, then it strongly suggests that the hypothesis is true as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan...

FINAL EXAM  Question 1. Did Heath v. Alabama or Lawrence v. Texas take place first?","output":"Heath v. Alabama took place first, before Lawrence v. Texas. Heath v. Alabama is a United States Supreme Court case that was decided on November 6, 1985. The case involved a criminal defendant named Larry Gene Heath, who had been charged with the murder of his wife and unborn child in both Alabama and Georgia. The primary question was whether the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibited the second trial in Alabama after Heath had already been convicted and sentenced in Georgia for the same crime. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply in this case, as the two states were separate sovereigns, and therefore, two separate trials could be held. Lawrence v. Texas is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that was decided on June 26, 2003. The case involved two men, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner, who were arrested and convicted under a Texas law that criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults. The defendants appealed their convictions, arguing that the Texas law violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects the right to liberty and privacy. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Texas law was unconstitutional, holding that the state had no legitimate interest in regulating private, consensual sexual conduct between adults. This landmark decision effectively invalidated all similar laws across the United States that criminalized consensual same-sex activity and significantly advanced LGBTQ+ rights in the country. In summary, Heath v. Alabama took place first, with the case being decided in 1985, while Lawrence v. Texas took place later, with the decision being handed down in 2003. Both cases addressed important legal issues, with Heath v. Alabama focusing on the limits of the Double Jeopardy Clause in the context of multiple prosecutions by different states, and Lawrence v. Texas addressing the constitutionality of laws that criminalized private, consensual sexual conduct between adults."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin, a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel. She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves.

Here are possible answers to this question: - aquarium - creek - pet store - playground - pond  I believe the correct choice is \\"aquarium\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"Aquarium, and there are several reasons that support this conclusion. First, let's analyze each potential answer and consider the plausibility of the situation. 1. Aquarium: This is a highly likely scenario since goldfish are commonly kept as pets or display animals in aquariums. A colorful pebble may be used as a decoration in the tank along with other ornaments. 2. Creek: Although it is possible for goldfish to be found in a creek, it is less likely for a colorful pebble to specifically land on a goldfish in this setting. Creeks can be expansive, and the probability of the pebble and the goldfish's positions aligning in a way that allows the pebble to fall on the goldfish is much lower than in a confined space, such as an aquarium. 3. Pet store: While goldfish can indeed be found in pet stores, it becomes less likely for a colorful pebble to fall on the goldfish - the pet store would typically contain goldfish in a tank, much like an aquarium, but the pebble would have to either be dropped accidentally or deliberately placed on the goldfish. 4. Playground: This scenario is highly improbable as goldfish would not naturally be found in a playground, and it would be quite unusual for someone to bring a goldfish to a playground where it could potentially be exposed to a colorful pebble. 5. Pond: Similar to the creek scenario, it is possible for goldfish to be found in a pond, but the likelihood of a colorful pebble landing on a goldfish in a pond is low. Ponds are larger bodies of water, and the odds of the pebble falling directly on a goldfish become more diminished compared to an aquarium setting. With these considerations, it becomes evident that the most plausible answer to the question is \\"aquarium.\\" An aquarium is a closed environment in which goldfish are commonly found, and it is also an environment that is easily controlled and managed by humans. This gives the highest chance for a colorful pebble to fall on a goldfish, as both elements are purposefully placed in the space in close proximity to one another, oftentimes as decorations. Additionally, the other scenarios presented, although not impossible, are highly improbable and far less likely than the aquarium scenario. In most cases, the positions of the pebble and the goldfish are determined by natural occurrences, making it unlikely for a random colorful pebble to fall onto a goldfish in the wild or in other uncommon locations. Overall, the logical choice is \\"aquarium,\\" as it provides the most reasonable and suitable environment for a colorful pebble to fall on a goldfish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell, (\\"née\\" Stevenson; 29 September 1810  12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist and short story writer. Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor, and are of interest to social historians as well as lovers of literature. Her first novel, \\"Mary Barton\\", was published in 1848. Gaskell's \\"The Life of Charlotte Brontë\\", published in 1857, was the first biography about Brontë. Some of Gaskell's best known novels are \\"Cranford\\" (185153), \\"North and South\\" (1854-55), and \\"Wives and Daughters\\" (1865).  - Darryl Francis Zanuck (September 5, 1902December 22, 1979) was an American film producer and studio executive; he earlier contributed stories for films starting in the silent era.

He earned three Academy Awards as producer for Best Picture during his tenure, but was responsible for many more.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call \\"Collie\\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. Common use of the name \\"collie\\" in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds  such as to the Rough Collie in parts of the United States, or to the Border Collie in many rural parts of Great Britain. Many collie types do not actually include \\"collie\\" in their name.  - Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (known professionally as Warner Bros.

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as \\"GSD\\" and was also formerly known as the Alsatian in Britain. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.  - Rin Tin Tin (often hyphenated as Rin-Tin-Tin, September 10, 1918  August 10, 1932) was a male German Shepherd that was an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a World War I battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him \\"Rinty\\". Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of Warner Bros. studios, and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck.   - Etzel von Oeringen (October 1, 1917  June 24, 1929), better known as Strongheart, was a male German Shepherd who became one of the earliest canine film stars.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec.

Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - Written in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Brains Benton Mysteries chronicle the adventures of young teenagers Barclay \\"Brains\\" Benton (X) and his friend James \\"Jimmy\\" Carson (Operative Three); they together form the \\"Benton and Carson International Detective Agency.\\" The Brains Benton books are similar in tone to The Mad Scientists' Club books.  - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Eric Oswald Mowbray Knight (April 10, 1897 in Menston in West Yorkshire, England  January 15, 1943 in Suriname) was an English novelist and screenwriter, who is mainly notable for creating the fictional collie Lassie. He took American citizenship in 1942 shortly before his death.  - Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Lassie is a fictional character created by Eric Knight, she is a female Rough Collie dog, and is featured in a short story that was later expanded to a full-length novel called \\"Lassie Come-Home\\". Knight's portrayal of Lassie bears some features in common with another fictional female collie of the same name, and is featured in the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell's 1859 short story called \\"The Half Brothers.\\" In \\"The Half Brothers\\", Lassie is loved only by her young master and guides the adults back to where two boys are lost in a snowstorm.  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated breed of medium to large size dog that in its original form was a type of collie used and bred for herding in Scotland. Originating in the 1800s, it is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and through the \\"Lassie\\" novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable, merles, and tri-coloured. This breed looks like a bigger version of the Shetland Sheepdog, but they are not related.

As he watches the tapes, he realizes they are snuff films, taken in the very room in which they are staying. The couple are alarmed by this as well as loud, insistent banging coming from the door to the adjacent room, and try to run away. Men dressed in black and wearing masks stop them, and they return to their room. David makes a run to the motel's payphone booth to no avail, escaping it just before a car crashes into it. The couple decides to lock themselves in the room when they notice a truck pull in. They try to warn the truck driver only to find out that he's actually there to buy a box of tapes of the snuff films.David and Amy escape into a tunnel that they discover in the bathroom of their room.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: When applying compression to an injured Achilles tendon it's a good idea to start wrapping above the injured area. Place the end of the bandage against the skin and then wrap the bandage around it several times to keep it in place. You want the bandage to be medium tight. This means that it is tight enough to stay in place while not cutting off the circulation. Work your way down from the ankle. When you get to the heel start wrapping around the arch of the foot and down to the toes. It may be that that very corner of your heel is still exposed after your first pass. Then wrap back up the foot and the ankle, making sure to cover areas that have not yet been covered. Keep a small amount of tension on the bandage as you go. This will keep your wraps neat but will not put too much restriction on your circulation. Once you have used up all of your bandage, it needs to be physically attached to itself. Many modern compression bandages come with Velcro on their ends, which will attach to the bandage when it is pressed on the surface. However, if yours doesn't have Velcro, you will need to use a safety pin to secure the end. Summary:","output":"When you need to wrap a hurt leg, start above the ouchy spot. Use a bandage to wrap around your leg, make it just tight enough but not too tight. Wrap all the way down to your toes and then back up again. Be sure to cover all parts.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously  warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Attempts by the gallery's board of directors to fire Bean are thwarted by the chairman who, for unspecified reasons, is very fond of him. Desperate to rid themselves of the turmoil Bean unintentionally causes, the board members send him to the United States to represent them at the unveiling of the portrait Whistler's Mother, which has been purchased for 50 million by the Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Bean's visit has been arranged by the gallery's curator, David Langley (Peter MacNicol) who is being very impressed by the National Gallery's fabricated praise of \\"Dr. Bean\\", decides to board him in his house. On his flight to Los Angeles, Bean attempts to amuse a child with air sickness by blowing up his M&Ms; bag and popping it to wake up the man in front of him, but without success. After the child throws up into an air sickness bag, Bean takes the bag from him and repeats the bag popping over the man's face, only to splatter him with vomit. He hides from the man upon his arrival to Los Angeles, where he is detained at the airport due to pretending to have a gun.

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. X then signed to Elektra in 1982 to release Under the Big Black Sun, which marked a slight departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The album was heavily influenced by the death of Cervenka's elder sister Mirielle (Mary) in a 1980 automobile accident. Three songs on the album (\\"Riding with Mary\\", \\"Come Back to Me\\" and the title track) all directly related to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of Al Dubin and Joe Burke's \\"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\\", was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka's mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album  \\"You know, my favorite record is Under the Big Black Sun, so everything else is kind of . . .  I'm saying if I had to sit down in a room and put on an X record--which I don't generally do--I have recently listened to some X records but I generally don't listen to myself--the record I would pick to listen to would be Under the Big Black Sun.  In 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the More Fun in the New World album, making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band's rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\", and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The record received critical praise from Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound.  The Knitters, a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of the Red Devils) on double bass, and released the Poor Little Critter on the Road album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; their take on Merle Haggard's \\"Silver Wings\\" \\"may be the definitive version\\". Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was \\"Under the Big Black Sun\\" a successful album?","output":"Yes, \\"Under the Big Black Sun\\" was a successful album.

The shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at.

However, \\"Hatred\\" stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do, and that's in the story and character department. Essentially, things just kind-of happen. Eric Seaver doesn't evolve at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development. Also, the ending is very abrupt.  However- since this is a horror film, since when do we care about plot? We just want to see people die, and \\"Hatred\\" certainly delivers. As the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering \\"Kill her! Kill em' all!\\" When people scream back at the screen, it's always fun.  That's the place where \\"Hatred\\" succeeds.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Comedy of intrigue is a genre that includes what comedy by William Shakespeare that is thought to have been written in 1598?","output":"Comedy of intrigue is a theatrical genre which emphasizes elaborate and intricate plotlines, witty dialogue, and convoluted schemes usually intended to deceive or manipulate other characters, often resulting in comical misunderstandings and humorous situations. Within this genre, there is a well-renowned comedy by the universally acclaimed playwright, William Shakespeare, that is believed to have been penned around 1598. This comedic play is titled \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is one of Shakespeare's most popular and enduring plays, employing themes of love, mistaken identities, deception, and manipulation, all of which are hallmarks of the comedy of intrigue. The play is set in Messina, a port city on the island of Sicily, Italy, and primarily focuses on two romantic relationships between the main characters: Beatrice and Benedick, as well as Hero and Claudio. The story begins with the arrival of Don Pedro, the Prince of Aragon, and his entourage, which includes two young soldiers, Claudio and Benedick, who have just returned from a successful military campaign. Upon their arrival, Claudio falls in love with the governor's daughter, Hero, and plans to marry her. However, various complications arise in the form of deliberate deceit and mischief orchestrated by Don John, Don Pedro's disgruntled and antagonistic illegitimate brother. Don John makes it his mission to disrupt the romantic relationships and the lives of other characters, leading to mistaken identities and multiple humorous misunderstandings. Meanwhile, Beatrice and Benedick, who are both known for their sharp wit and strong opinions on love and marriage, are constantly engaged in a verbal battle of wits. The two engage in a \\"merry war\\" of verbal sparring and refuse to acknowledge any potential romantic feelings for each other. However, their friends are determined to bring them together, so a group of comical conspirators initiates an elaborate plan to deceive both Benedick and Beatrice into believing that each is secretly in love with the other. This subplot adds an additional layer of intrigue to the play's central story, creating an even more complex and humorous narrative. As the play unfolds, more comical misunderstandings take place, misunderstandings are eventually resolved, false rumors are dispelled, and love triumphs over deceit, ultimately ending in the joining of both couples in marriage. \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" remains an excellent example of a comedy of intrigue, with its skillful blending of complex storylines, engaging characters, and witty dialogue, which come together to present a compelling and timeless narrative that continues to entertain audiences more than four centuries after it was first written."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I almost never had a first date. A young lady I met in the hospital cafeteria where I worked as a pharmacy intern (she was an X-ray tech) I asked out on a date. Would you like to follow me home? she asked. I said SURE! She got in her car, hit the freeway, went over the top of the hill..and was gone. I went 75 mph desperately trying to keep her tail lights in my line of sight while swerving in and out of traffic. I thought if you don’t really want to go out with me, just tell me, don’t try to ditch me! I finally caught up with her but found out she always drives that way. If Janet Guthrie wasn’t the first woman to drive in the Indy 500, she would have been. Over the years as she got older, collecting speeding tickets got old so she became a more responsible driver. I’m glad, because I had to help pay for those tickets over the last 30+ years we’ve been married. Glad I caught up to her that one night on the freeway. EDIT, AND BACKSTORY: She ate lunch with her X-ray tech coworkers. She left the table first and I approached the others and asked what was her name, the girl that just left. They told me, and about a half hour later called the radiology department from the pharmacy phone and asked for her. She said all the girls in the department were huddled around the phone and giggling while we talked. It’s the handsome blonde intern in the pharmacy, they told each other. Oh, you mean THAT one?!

These categories are aspects of the more nuanced nature of sexual identity and terminology. For example, people may use other labels, such as pansexual or polysexual, or none at all. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation \\"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions\\". Androphilia and gynephilia are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual orientation as an alternative to a gender binary conceptualization. Androphilia describes sexual attraction to masculinity; gynephilia describes the sexual attraction to femininity. The term sexual preference largely overlaps with sexual orientation, but is generally distinguished in psychological research.

No mother, they insisted, would admit to caring more for one son or daughter than another. So much for that. His team’s interviewers, talking to mothers ages 65 to 75 in the Boston area about their adult offspring, found that most were perfectly willing to name favorites. “Most mothers have very distinct preferences,” Dr. Pillemer said. “There’s one to whom they feel most emotionally close, one with whom they have the most conflict. Parental favoritism is a fundamental part of the family landscape throughout life.” In other words, he added, “the Smothers Brothers were right.” (Note to younger readers: On their hit comedy show in the 1960s, Tom Smothers used to complain to brother Dick that … well, read the headline above.) Further studies revealed that middle-aged children often recognized that their parents felt closer to one child than another — but were off-base about who ranked highest. “They typically choose themselves,” Dr. Pillemer said, “and they’re typically wrong.” One might file this under “Stuff I’d Just as Soon Not Know,” except that the care of the elderly falls mostly to their children and that one child usually shoulders the bulk of the responsibility. Mothers also express clear ideas about whom they want and expect to take on that role, it turns out, so their partiality has consequences. Who’s the lucky child? She is the one the mother feels emotionally closest to and thinks is most similar, who shares her attitudes and values. And she is the one who has provided support and help for her mother in the past. The choice of pronoun is deliberate: research has long confirmed that this job falls overwhelmingly to daughters. That reflects women’s traditional roles, but Dr. Pillemer pointed out that it also reflected similarity — a higher degree of closeness between mothers and daughters than between mothers and sons. “If you expect you may be losing your autonomy, you want a child who shares your values,” he said. “If someone’s going to be making decisions for you and you know you’re going to be dependent on her, you want someone you feel close to.” What does not seem to make much difference is whether a child has competing demands on her time — whether she can actually take on these tasks. “Mom’s not thinking of things like: ‘Is my daughter married? Does she have children? Does she have problems that might prevent her being a good caregiver? Does she have the resources to be a good caregiver?’” Dr. Pillemer said. “Being married or being a parent didn’t matter at all. Being employed only mattered a little.” (Children did get a pass if they were geographically distant.) Nor do mothers put much weight on reciprocity — whether they had provided help to particular children in the past. Expectations about caregiving clearly represent an emotional decision, not a pragmatic one. In fact, even a child who would appear patently unsuitable gets the nod if the mother always liked her best. To the investigators’ surprise, mothers were not dissuaded by a history of substance abuse or other mental health problems, or even by past trouble with the law. Susie, who did drugs and ended up in rehab for months, is picked if she and her mother are close; Billy, who has been Mr. Straightarrow but feels more distant with Mom, isn’t really in the running. I confess that I had trouble envisioning a family conversation on this subject. In a society where most older people cannot even bear to sign an advance directive, are they really going to talk about which children they have quietly chosen as their future caregivers? Acknowledging preferences to a researcher who guarantees your anonymity might prove a lot easier than acknowledging them to your children. Dr. Pillemer wasn’t so sure. He said families eventually talked about who was going to do what to take care of their parents. If Susie is planning to light out for the other coast to start a new life as a ceramicist and won’t be on call, it is better to know that sooner rather than later.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

What type of animal is the Alaskan husky and Small Münsterländer? The answer is:","output":"The Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are two distinct types of dog breeds, each with their own unique characteristics, backgrounds, and uses. By examining these breeds individually, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of what type of animals they are. First, let's discuss the Alaskan Husky. The Alaskan Husky is a breed of working dog that is primarily used for sled racing and transportation in Arctic regions. Although they are genetically diverse and not officially recognized as a standardized breed by major kennel clubs, Alaskan Huskies typically possess certain traits that make them ideally suited for their intended tasks. These dogs have a lean, muscular build, which enables them to maintain high levels of endurance and strength. Their thick double coats provide insulation against harsh winter weather, and their large paws help them to traverse snowy terrain with ease. Alaskan Huskies are known for their speed, stamina, and strong work ethic. They are also an intelligent and friendly breed, forming close bonds with their human handlers. In contrast, the Small Münsterländer, also known as the Kleine Münsterländer, is a versatile hunting dog breed that originated in the Münster region of Germany. This breed is part of the gun dog family and is known for its exceptional skills in tracking, pointing, and retrieving game, both on land and in water. The Small Münsterländer is recognized as a standardized breed by many kennel clubs, including the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and the American Kennel Club. Small Münsterländers have a medium-sized, well-proportioned build, with strong muscles, a dense, wavy coat, and feathering on their legs, ears, and tail. They are characterized by their keen sense of smell and high level of intelligence, as well as their adaptability and enthusiasm for work. These dogs are adept at hunting all types of game, from birds to rabbits and even deer. They are also known for their friendly and affectionate nature, making them excellent companions and family pets in addition to being skilled hunting partners. In conclusion, although the Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are both types of dogs, they serve different purposes and possess unique characteristics that set them apart from one another. The Alaskan Husky is a strong, resilient sled dog with origins in Arctic regions, while the Small Münsterländer is a versatile hunting dog from Germany. Both breeds are intelligent, adaptable, and friendly, making them highly valued as working dogs and beloved companions."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

'PLL' actor Brandon Jones charged with assault \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" actor Brandon Jones was charged with assault for pointing a gun at a neighbor during a dispute, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said Thursday. The felony charge dates back to March 24, when Jones was arrested for apparently pulling out the firearm during the argument. He also pulled a knife on the unnamed neighbor during the same incident, sparking an additional misdemeanor charge, authorities said. And as far back as October, the actor also pulled a \\"hidden handgun\\" in a separate incident with a neighbor at his North Hills home, the DA said. It's unclear if it was the same neighbor involved in both disputes, or what sparked the arguments. The 27-year-old star never fired the gun or struck his neighbor with it during the most recent confrontation, according to TMZ. But the act of pointing the gun is enough to constitute assault alone. A rep for Jones told the celebrity gossip site that they believe the TV actor will be acquitted. \\"It is our understanding that the gun in Mr. Jones' possession was fully legal and registered, that he was on his girlfriend's private property, and that he and his girlfriend felt that they were under threat in a dispute with neighbors,\\" the rep said.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the exact title of the diploma piece without which Etty could not become a Royal Academician?  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The use of Java: Java is a widely-used programming language because of several reasons that make it an attractive choice for developers and businesses alike. Here are some of the key reasons why organizations and individuals prefer using Java: 1. Platform Independence: Java's \\"Write Once, Run Anywhere\\" approach allows Java applications to run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it easier for developers to create applications that work consistently across multiple platforms.  2. Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) which enables developers to build modular, reusable and easily maintainable code. OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction allow for increased flexibility and improved overall code quality. 3. Strong Community Support: Java has a large, active, and well-established community of developers, which means that developers have access to a wealth of resources, including libraries, frameworks, tutorials, and support forums. This strong community makes it easier for developers to find solutions to common challenges and continuously improve their skillset. 4. Robustness and Security: Java offers built-in security features such as runtime exception handling and type checking that help prevent errors and protect applications from vulnerabilities. The Java security model restricts access to critical system resources, ensuring that applications are less prone to system crashes, data corruption, and security breaches. 5. Scalability and Performance: Java is designed to support the development of high-performance and highly scalable applications. Features such as multithreading, automatic memory management, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation help to enhance application performance, ensuring that Java applications can effectively handle varying workloads and maintain responsiveness in an efficient manner. 6. Rich Ecosystem: Java’s ecosystem includes numerous open-source libraries and frameworks, which help speed up the development process and allow developers to focus on business logic rather than developing every component from scratch. Some popular Java frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, among others. In The Revenant, why did the tribes attack Glass and his company when they didn't kidnap the chief’s daughter? In the movie \\"The Revenant,\\" the Arikara tribe attacks Glass and his company after mistakenly believing that the fur trappers had kidnapped the daughter of their chief, Elk Dog. This attack is the result of a misunderstanding and a series of unfortunate events that led the tribe to believe that their chief's daughter, Powaqa, had been abducted by the trappers. The tribespeople's primary goal throughout the movie is to recover Powaqa and protect their community, leading to several conflicts and aggressive encounters with Glass and his companions. It is important to note that these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question focuses on the use of Java as a programming language and the benefits it provides, while the second question is about a specific plot point in the movie \\"The Revenant.\\" The two questions address completely unrelated topics, and as such, they cannot be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trebuie să ne dăm seama că independenţa băncilor centrale nu a fost opţiunea potrivită, atât din punctul de vedere al controlului democratic şi politic, cât şi din cel al eficacităţii economice. Translate this to English?","output":"We must realize that the independence of central banks has not been the appropriate choice, considering it both from the perspective of democratic and political control, as well as from the one of economic effectiveness. We must acknowledge that numerous factors indicate the fact that the independence of central banks may not have been the best choice when we evaluate this policy decision in the context of democratic and political control, along with its consequences on the economic effectiveness of our societies. In the following detailed analysis, we will examine the limitations and challenges posed by this approach, focusing on its implications for democratic accountability and economic productivity. Firstly, from the standpoint of political control and democracy, the independence of central banks can be viewed as a challenge to the core principles of a democratic system. It is widely understood that in democratic societies, policy decisions and the exercise of power are supposed to be vested in the hands of elected representatives, who are held accountable by the citizens. This way, the general public can influence decisions that impact their lives and shape the direction of their communities. However, when central banks operate independently, this means that monetary policy decisions are made by unelected officials, shielded from any direct influence by the public or their elected representatives. Such decisions can have significant consequences on inflation, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables that directly impact the livelihoods of citizens. By giving central banks the autonomy to take these decisions in isolation, we effectively remove a layer of democratic accountability and public influence. This can lead to situations where the policies enacted may not necessarily align with the larger public interest or the preferences of the majority. Secondly, the economic effectiveness of central banks is a crucial aspect that needs to be assessed in evaluating the appropriateness of their independence. Autonomous central banks generally adhere to a mandate of maintaining price stability, which implies controlling inflation within a predetermined range. Although price stability is an essential precondition for long-term economic growth, focus on this singular goal may sometimes translate to a disregard for other important macroeconomic objectives, such as job creation or income distribution. A less independent central bank, on the other hand, may have a broader mandate, incorporating multiple objectives within its policy framework and facilitating a more comprehensive approach to macroeconomic management. This might lead to a more balanced policy mix that addresses various dimensions of economic well-being. Additionally, the potential for enhanced coordination with fiscal authorities can contribute towards mitigating economic crises through more effective countercyclical measures, including targeted stimulus and policy adjustments. In conclusion, considering the independence of central banks from the lens of democratic and political control, as well as economic effectiveness, it is evident that there are valid concerns associated with this policy choice. The detachment of central banks from direct public accountability and influence might undermine the core tenets of democratic governance, while their narrow policy focus can sometimes prioritize price stability at the expense of other crucial macroeconomic objectives. Thus, it is essential to continue assessing and evolving our understanding of such institutional arrangements, weighing their benefits against potential drawbacks to ensure a sound decision-making process and the overall prosperity of our societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Jusuf Kalla was born on 15 May 1942 in Watampone, the capital of the Bone Regency in South Sulawesi. His parents were Hadji Kalla, a local businessman and Athirah, a woman who sold Buginese silk for a living. He was the second of 10 children. After completing school, Kalla attended Hasanuddin University in Makassar. Context: Kalla has been often mentioned as a possible nominee of the Golkar Party in the 2014 presidential race. In 2009 Kalla ran in the Indonesian presidential election with former Armed Forces Chief of Staff Wiranto as his running mate, finishing third with 12.4% of the vote.  During a dedication ceremony of the Indonesian Red Cross headquarters in the Riau province on 3 February 2012 Kalla stated his willingness to run in the presidential election in 2014 should he receive sufficient public support. By May 2012 however, Kalla stated that he had no intention of running in the 2014 Presidential election. Kalla said he had no hard feelings about party chairman Aburizal Bakrie's upcoming inauguration as presidential candidate for the Golkar Party and that he had no intention of competing with him despite surveys that showed that Kalla was likely to be more electable than Bakrie. During Golkar's National Leadership meeting in Bogor on 29 June 2012, Bakrie was officially declared the Golkar Party's 2014 Presidential candidate.  Nevertheless, in the changeable political scene in Indonesia the situation can be expected to evolve in the preparations for the 2014 presidential election. In late 2012 Jusuf Kalla indicated that he would be prepared to move away from Golkar and join a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) with former president Megawati as candidate for president and him as the vice-presidential candidate. \\"If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics,\\" Kalla said. Question: Was he asked to run or did he decide on his own?. Whats the answer?","output":"Jusuf Kalla's decision to express his willingness to run in the 2014 presidential election, as mentioned during the dedication ceremony of the Indonesian Red Cross headquarters on 3 February 2012, seemed to be a personal decision that he made based on public support. However, as the political scene evolved, it is clear that Kalla's final decision to potentially run on a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) alongside Megawati, was likely influenced by a combination of personal aspirations, political party dynamics, and public opinion. In May 2012, Kalla stated that he had no intention to run in the 2014 presidential race and expressed no desire to compete against Aburizal Bakrie, who was later declared Golkar Party's presidential candidate in June 2012. It can be inferred that Kalla may not have received explicit support from his own party (Golkar) to pursue the presidency, which could have been a factor in his initial decision not to run. However, by late 2012, Kalla showed a change of heart and openness to enter the presidential race, not as a representative of the Golkar Party, but rather through a partnership with the PDI-P. This shift suggests that Kalla's decision may have been influenced by the evolving political landscape and potential opportunities presented by aligning with another party, such as the PDI-P. Kalla's statement, \\"If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics,\\" further indicates the role of political maneuvering in determining his decisions. In conclusion, Jusuf Kalla's decision to express interest in running for the 2014 presidential election appears to be a combination of personal motivation and political influences. The initial decision was likely made on his own, based on public support and aspirations, but his eventual openness to run under a different ticket was undeniably influenced by evolving political circumstances and opportunities."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cowboys, the Vikings came home for a Week 8 intraconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles that saw head coach Brad Childress go up against his mentor, Philadelphia coach Andy Reid. With starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson out with a thumb injury, veteran backup Kelly Holcomb got the start. In the first quarter, Minnesota took an early lead as Holcomb completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. The Eagles responded with a 20-yard David Akers field goal, before running back Brian Westbrook scored a 6-yard touchdown catch followed by a 1-yard run to put the Eagles up 17-7. Minnesota's only response for the period was a 39-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell. In the third quarter, Akers and Longwell traded field goals from 27 and 32 yards. Longwell then drew the Vikings to within four points on a 48-yard field goal with just under 9 minutes to play in the game, only for Akers to seal the win for the Eagles on a 25-yard field goal. Holcomb (7/16 for 88 yards and 1 touchdown) was concussed on a sack in the third quarter, resulting in Brooks Bollinger (7/10 for 94 yards) coming in to finish the game. How many total yards did Longwell have?","output":"To determine the total yards Ryan Longwell had, we need to add up the yardage from each of his field goals.

It does, however, have two things going for it: outstanding punch-ups and Jet Li. 2. Jet Li is a formidable talent and has plenty of charisma, but it's the rest of the cast (or most of them) whose performances are stilted...no shortage of martial arts action in a variety of extended contest scenes 3. The Terminator flicks also favored world peace but didn't pause the action for nearly an hour to rub it in. 4. Serves as a rousing, philosophically high-minded reminder of the actor's glory days. 5. has lofty ambitions but lacks the necessary talent. 6. Touted as his last foray into martial-arts movies, Fearless finds Jet Li bowing out with a stunner. 7. Not only is it a gripping, beautifully acted drama, but the action scenes are jaw-dropping. 8. Significantly, the movie breaks the standard revenge model of the martial arts film genre to embrace the grace and restraint that underlines the philosophy of wushu (the comprehensive term for martial arts that means 'avert fighting' or 'stop war'). 9. Fearless is a rather conventional costume biopicbiopic that still manages to pack a satisfying emotional punch by its final reel. 10. A grandiose spectacle that will remind any martial arts fan why they love the genre so much. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"To determine the overall consensus about the movie, I will analyze the main points mentioned in each review: 1. Positive: Outstanding punch-ups, Jet Li's performance 2. Mixed: Jet Li's performance is praised, but the rest of the cast have stilted performances, good martial arts action in extended scenes 3. Negative: Action pauses for too long to emphasize message 4. Positive: Rousing, philosophically high-minded, reminiscent of Jet Li's glory days 5. Negative: Lofty ambitions without the necessary talent 6. Positive: Jet Li's last martial-arts movie is a stunner 7. Positive: Gripping drama, beautifully acted, jaw-dropping action scenes 8. Positive: Breaks standard revenge model, embraces grace and restraint of wushu philosophy 9. Mixed: Conventional costume biopic with a satisfying emotional punch in the end 10.

This means that the cherry pit heated up less when rolling over the (A) lunch tray (B) lunchroom floor  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"lunchroom floor\\" and  \\"lunch tray\\". A:","output":"The cherry pit heated up less when rolling over the lunchroom floor.  To understand this scenario, we must explore the factors that impact the rolling motion of the cherry pit and its heating. Two primary forces are at play here: friction and rolling resistance. Friction refers to the resistance that occurs when one object moves against another. Rolling resistance, on the other hand, is the force that opposes the rolling motion of an object due to deformation, or the changes in the shape and structure of the object and surface in contact. When Tim rolled the cherry pit on his lunch tray, the pit likely experienced lower rolling resistance due to the smooth and relatively uniform surface of the tray. In contrast, the lunchroom floor may be rougher and have more uneven features, increasing rolling resistance. To overcome this resistance, more energy is required for the cherry pit to maintain its rolling motion. Heat is generated as a result of this additional energy input and the mechanical work done to overcome the rolling resistance. When the cherry pit rolls on the lunchroom floor, the increased resistance results in more work being done and more energy being converted into heat. This leads to a higher temperature for the cherry pit when it rolls on the floor compared to the lunch tray. Therefore, when rolling on the lunchroom floor, the cherry pit experiences slower motion and higher rolling resistance, leading to more energy being converted into heat. This means that the cherry pit heated up less when rolling over the lunch tray as compared to the lunchroom floor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a title for this article: “I was really afraid, and I felt all alone,” Diana Kami, an artist who lives in the 10th Arrondissement with her daughter, said of the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, many in her neighborhood. The next Monday, after dropping her daughter at school, she was overwhelmed by a desire to make art. Almost instinctively, she said, she began to paint on a wall along rue Alibert that is often used as a canvas for local street artists – and is just steps from Le Petit Cambodge and Le Carillon, two cafes targeted in the attacks. Several mothers from her daughter’s school, just on the other side of the wall, took notice of Ms. Kami’s work and requested permission from the local government to paint the entire wall. “We wanted to do something,” said one of them, Gaelle Giffard, who crowdfunded 500 euros from the neighborhood to cover the cost of paint. The result is “Dessine-Moi un Bouquet,” a communitywide initiative that invited street and graffiti artists, as well as local residents and children, to cover the wall with images in response to the attacks. One mother told Ms. Kami that the wall, nicknamed Le Mur de l’Amour, or wall of love, has had a calming effect so that she is no longer afraid to walk in the street. An elderly man told Ms. Kami that simply watching her paint helped him find peace. For her own contribution, Ms. Kami painted a forest of trees, their branches outstretched. “In nature, the hunter protects himself in the forest,” she said, “and the tree is life.

Title: The Iron Giant Movie plot: In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

He calls after the boys and helps them reunite, asking the Giant to keep Hogarth out of trouble. Mansley doesn't give up; he soon remotely activates the BB gun, which leads him to the Giant and Hogarth. He calls Rogard to the scene, who mobilizes tanks and mobile infantry to take the Giant down. The Giant, having an intrinsic understanding of his true nature, doesn't fight back and merely ensures that Hogarth remains safe. Mansley, on the other hand, continues to escalate the situation and orders a thermonuclear missile strike. When Rogard learns the missile is targeted at Rockwell (and therefore himself and his soldiers), he pleads with Mansley to abandon the situation. Mansley panics and is knocked unconscious when he refuses to flee the scene without Rogard and Lieutenant Colonel Alan J. Kerberos. Knowing that a suicide mission awaits them, the Giant laments that they must save Rockwell. Encouraged by Hogarth's words and the memory of Superman, the Giant orders Hogarth to take cover and leaps to the stratosphere.

OPTIONS: - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What is there in the Bermuda triangle? The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean that is roughly triangular in shape, with vertices at Miami, Florida; Bermuda; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It covers an area of approximately 500,000 square miles. Due to its geographical location, the area experiences unique weather patterns and oceanographic features that may provide clues for answering this question. Various natural phenomena exist within the Bermuda Triangle that can potentially explain some of the events and disappearances linked to this region: 1. Compass variation: In the Bermuda Triangle, compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, resulting in navigation issues. This is because the earth's magnetic fields change, and the region has one of the few places where true north and magnetic north align. 2. Gulf Stream: The Gulf Stream is a powerful, fast-moving ocean current that runs through the area and can quickly change weather conditions and move ships off course. 3. Methane hydrates: Methane hydrates deposits on the ocean floor can release gas, causing the water to become less dense and potentially cause ships to sink. 4. Rogue waves: These are unusually large waves that can form suddenly and without warning, posing a significant threat to ships and aircraft. 5. Hexagonal clouds: Meteorologists have discovered hexagonal cloud formations in the Bermuda Triangle that can cause intense downbursts of wind, known as \\"air bombs,\\" and may be responsible for some incidents. Question 2: What is the truth behind the Bermuda Triangle? As for the truth behind the Bermuda Triangle, while some blame mysterious forces or extraterrestrial activity for the various disappearances that have occurred in the region, there is no single, definitive explanation for the alleged events. Numerous scientific theories have been proposed, revolving around the natural phenomena mentioned above, that could potentially account for a significant number of the incidents. In addition to these explanations, it is essential to consider human error, equipment failure, and other causes that are commonly associated with accidents in the open sea. Furthermore, the higher number of reported incidents in the region may be attributed to increased traffic due to the area's location along major shipping and air travel routes. Comparing the two questions, it can be inferred that both questions are related but not identical. Question 1 asks about the specific elements found within the Bermuda Triangle, whereas Question 2 aims to address the underlying truth behind the phenomena and occurrences associated with the region. Therefore, while the two questions address the general topic of the Bermuda Triangle, they are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who refused Disney's request to rewrite the song for the film Dinosaur?, using the article: Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused.

(B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","output":"(A). Yes, \\"One guy playing his instrument\\" and \\"One man is playing his instrument\\" essentially convey the same meaning. However, there are some minor differences in the choice of words and the grammatical structure of these phrases. In both phrases, we are describing a situation in which an individual, referred to as \\"guy\\" or \\"man,\\" is in the act of playing a musical instrument. Both terms, \\"guy\\" and \\"man,\\" are commonly used to refer to an adult male individual. The choice between \\"guy\\" and \\"man\\" here is mainly a matter of style or preference, with 'guy' being more informal, and 'man' being a more neutral term. The first phrase, \\"One guy playing his instrument,\\" is a noun phrase that lacks a verb which would indicate the action of playing. It still presents a clear mental image of the situation and is often utilized in informal contexts or as a concise description.  The second phrase, \\"One man is playing his instrument,\\" is a complete sentence comprising a subject, verb, and object. The verb \\"is playing\\" denotes the ongoing action of playing the musical instrument and the sentence, as a whole, is more grammatically formal. In summary, while both phrases have the same meaning, there are slight differences in the choice of words (i.e., \\"guy\\" vs. \\"man\\") and the grammatical structure.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: What are the different forms of discipline administered by congregation elders among Jehovah's Witnesses, and how do they function in maintaining the spiritual integrity of the congregation? Answer: The different forms of discipline administered by congregation elders among Jehovah's Witnesses include disfellowshipping, reproof, and marking. Disfellowshipping is the strongest form of discipline, involving shunning unrepentant offenders to keep the congregation free from immoral influence and encourage the individual to realize the seriousness of their actions.

Detailed Instructions:  You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature. You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. Make sure that your story does not repeat the relation in the given paragraph (e.g., by avoiding verbatim copies of the given paragraph). Start by reading the background paragraph, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. Write a story that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to use your own words as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph. Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Problem:Background Paragraph: Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years or so. However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains approximately 300 sextillion (3×1023) stars and more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies. Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million (107) stars up to giants with one trillion (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The Universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the concepts in the background paragraph. Usage: Matter, dark matter, dark energy, galaxies, clusters, superclusters, galactic filaments, voids, and large regions of relative emptiness.  Explanation: These concepts are mentioned in the background paragraph, detailing different celestial structures, distributions in, and the scale of the universe. Part #2: Determine relationships in the background paragraph. Usage: The hierarchical distribution of matter and the range of structure sizes in the universe. Explanation: The given paragraph demonstrates a hierarchical relationship between various celestial structures, as well as the size range of these structures (from dwarf galaxies to giant galaxies). Part #3: Write a fictional story making use of the concepts and relationships. Usage: Maria, an astronaut, embarks on a journey to explore one of the galaxy clusters present within the Laniakea Supercluster. Explanation: Maria's journey involves the relationship between celestial structures as she explores a part of the vast Laniakea Supercluster, which the Local Group of galaxies containing Milky Way is a part of. Part #4: Avoid repeating the relationship in the given paragraph verbatim. Usage: Maria's mission is to study and map the distribution of dwarf and giant galaxies in an unknown galaxy cluster, rather than directly addressing the hierarchical distribution of matter. Explanation: The story does not directly repeat the hierarchical distribution of matter but incorporates the concepts of different sizes of galaxies and their distribution within a larger celestial structure. Part #5: Provide a connection back to the background paragraph. Usage: At one point, Maria encounters a vast void measuring hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter, reminding her that the Universe is filled with such empty regions. Explanation: The vast void Maria encounters ties back to the background paragraph, which details that voids exist between larger structures in the Universe."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The only president to remain a bachelor, Buchanan's personal life has attracted great historical interest. His biographer Jean Baker argues that Buchanan was asexual or celibate. Several writers have put forth arguments that he was homosexual, including sociologist James W. Loewen, and authors Robert P. Watson and Shelley Ross.  In 1818, Buchanan met Anne Caroline Coleman at a grand ball at Lancaster's White Swan Inn, and the two began courting. Anne was the daughter of the wealthy iron manufacturer (and protective father) Robert Coleman and sister-in-law of Philadelphia judge Joseph Hemphill, one of Buchanan's colleagues from the House of Representatives. By 1819, the two were engaged, but could spend little time together; Buchanan was extremely busy with his law firm and political projects during the Panic of 1819, which took him away from Coleman for weeks at a time. Conflicting rumors abounded. Some suggested that he was marrying for her money, because his own family was less affluent, or that he was involved with other women. Buchanan never publicly spoke of his motives or feelings, but letters from Anne revealed she knew of several rumors. Coleman broke off the engagement, and soon afterward, on December 9, 1819, died suddenly. Buchanan wrote her father for permission to attend the funeral, claiming \\"I feel happiness has fled from me forever\\"; However, Robert Coleman refused permission.  After Coleman's death, Buchanan never courted another woman, nor seemed to show any emotional or physical interest. An unfounded rumor circulated of an affair with President Polk's widow, Sarah Childress Polk. Some believe that Anne's death served to deflect awkward questions about Buchanan's sexuality and bachelorhood. During Buchanan's presidency, his orphaned niece, Harriet Lane, whom he had adopted, served as official White House hostess.  Buchanan had a close and intimate relationship with William Rufus King, an Alabamian politician who briefly served as vice president under Franklin Pierce. Buchanan and King lived together in a Washington boardinghouse for many years, from 1834 until King's departure for France in 1844. King referred to the relationship as a \\"communion\\", and the two attended social functions together. Contemporaries also noted the closeness. Andrew Jackson called King \\"Miss Nancy\\" and prominent Democrat Aaron V. Brown referred to King as Buchanan's \\"better half\\", \\"wife\\" and \\"Aunt Fancy\\" (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man), Sociologist Loewen noted that \\"wags\\" described Buchanan and King as \\"Siamese twins\\", that Buchanan late in life wrote a letter acknowledging that he might marry a woman who could accept his \\"lack of ardent or romantic affection\\", and also that Buchanan was expelled from his Lancaster church, reportedly for pro-slavery views acquired during the King relationship. Catherine Thompson, the wife of cabinet member Jacob Thompson, later noted that \\"there was something unhealthy in the president's attitude\\". King became ill in 1853 and died of tuberculosis shortly after Pierce's inauguration, four years before Buchanan became president. Buchanan described him as \\"among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known.\\" Jean Baker's biography of Buchanan notes that his and King's nieces may have destroyed some correspondence between Buchanan and King. She opines that the length and intimacy of their surviving letters (one written by King upon his ambassadorial departure being specifically cited by Loewen) illustrate only \\"the affection of a special friendship.\\" Answer this question \\"Is there anything interesting about James Buchanan's personal life?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about James Buchanan's personal life. He was the only president to remain a bachelor, and his personal life has attracted great historical interest. Some biographers argue that he was asexual, celibate, or even homosexual.

In both sentences, the key information provided is that the mother is the tenth child of parents who migrated from Devonshire to Canada. The main difference between the two sentences pertains to the birthplace of the mother and the order of events, as detailed below: 1. In the first sentence, the mother is born in Devonshire. It specifies that the parents emigrated to Canada from Kingston, but the sentence doesn't provide a clear timeline of when the parents moved to Kingston. It's possible they moved to Kingston from Devonshire at some point before emigrating to Canada, but the exact sequence of events is not clear. 2. In the second sentence, the mother is born in Kingston. This sentence clarifies that the parents had already migrated from Devonshire to Canada (presumably settling in Kingston) before the mother was born. The use of the past perfect tense \\"had migrated\\" implies that the action was completed before the mother's birth. To sum it up, both sentences convey a general sense of the family's migration from Devonshire to Canada, but the primary difference lies in the mother's birthplace and the implied timeline of events.

Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - The Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP or NDP) is a social democratic political party in Ontario, Canada.

Zhang Heng (Chinese: Zhang Heng ; AD 78-139), formerly romanized as Chang Heng, was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer, an achievement also attributed to Archimedes (c. 287-212 BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl. AD 10-70). Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had termed the device the ji li gu che, or \\"li-recording drum carriage\\" (the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640 ft).  Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the \\"huang men\\"--court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal \\"drum-chariot\\". There is speculation that at some time during the 1st century BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.  The south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In reality there are very little ways for these companies to reduce their overheads . After the payroll fuel is the biggest expense . There are very few ways for them to reduce their these overheads . Small companies will even find this harder than the bigger companies . Answer the following question: What action is the company likely to take with this advice ?","output":"Based on the given advice, the company is likely to take a multi-faceted approach in an attempt to reduce overhead costs associated with payroll and fuel expenses. Although the advice indicates there are limited ways for businesses, especially smaller ones, to reduce these overheads, the company can still explore a range of strategies to optimize its operations and maximize cost efficiency. Some potential actions the company may consider include: 1. Implementing fuel-efficient practices: One solution to reducing fuel expenses would be to incorporate fuel-efficient technologies into their fleet of vehicles, such as utilizing electric or hybrid vehicles. The company can also invest in telematics and GPS tracking technology to monitor driver behavior, optimize routes, and minimize idling time, leading to efficient fuel consumption and reducing costs. 2. Workforce optimization: To address payroll expenses, the company could explore options like reevaluating their employee roster, ensuring that roles and responsibilities are precise, and that employees possess the necessary skills to perform their duties effectively. They may also consider investing in employee training and development to increase overall efficiency and workplace productivity. 3. Outsourcing and automation: Depending on the nature of the business, the company may explore outsourcing certain non-core tasks to external service providers or integrating automation and artificial intelligence (AI) systems into their operations. This could potentially help manage labor costs while still maintaining the quality of goods and services being provided. 4. Streamline processes: The company can examine its current business processes and determine if any unnecessary steps can be removed, combined, or redesigned, thereby reducing overhead, maximizing efficiency, and potentially lowering payroll costs. 5. Invest in renewable energy resources: For an eco-friendly solution and potential long-term savings, the company can explore renewable energy options such as solar power, which could help them reduce energy costs over time. 6. Cost-efficient partnerships: The company can establish relationships with vendors and suppliers who offer competitive pricing, good value, and a commitment to cost-saving practices, further assisting in reducing overall expenditures. 7. Employee retention: Focusing on employee retention is crucial for a company's overall cost reduction strategy. High employee turnover rates cost significantly more than adequately compensating and maintaining a stable workforce. By keeping employees satisfied and engaged in their work, the company can greatly reduce payroll costs connected with recruitment, hiring, and training new employees. 8. Periodic cost evaluations: The company should schedule regular assessments of their overhead costs. This can provide valuable insights into areas where they might be able to cut more expenses or identify inefficiencies in their current operations that could be improved. In conclusion, although the advice initially suggests that reducing overheads related to payroll and fuel expenses is difficult, especially for smaller companies, there are a number of strategies and actions the company can consider to effectively lower overhead costs and maximize operational efficiency. By taking a comprehensive approach to cost reduction, the company can develop solutions that not only address their immediate concerns but also promote long-term financial stability and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package info.guardianproject.pixelknot. The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: PixelKnot - Imperfect but Functional Image Steganography App Review: As a technology enthusiast who frequently dabbles in the world of secure and discreet communication, I have been using the PixelKnot app by Guardian Project for a while now. The app, which goes by the package name info.guardianproject.pixelknot, serves as an image steganography tool designed to enable users to encode messages within images. After using it for some time, I believe this app warrants a 3-star rating. Here's why: Step 1: Analyzing the App's Interface The user interface is a crucial aspect of any app; based on my experience, PixelKnot's interface is fairly clean and simple, allowing users to access its primary functions with ease. However, there could be improvements in terms of visuals and design to make it more appealing to a wider audience. Step 2: Evaluating the Functionality When it comes to functionality, the app delivers on its promise - allowing users to embed secret messages within images. The encryption and decryption processes are relatively straightforward, although sometimes the app can take a substantial amount of time to process the images, which may frustrate some users. Step 3: Assessing Security Measures In terms of security, I appreciate the fact that PixelKnot employs various security features, including password protection for messages and the utilization of the F5 algorithm for steganography. However, there are a few concerns about the app's open-source nature, which can have both positive and negative implications on security depending on the user's perspective.  Step 4: Reviewing the App's Updates and Maintenance  Keeping an app up-to-date with bug fixes and new features is essential for maintaining user satisfaction. PixelKnot seems to receive updates somewhat infrequently, which leaves users wondering whether the app is still being maintained and if all security aspects are up-to-date. In conclusion, the PixelKnot app is functional and reasonably secure, but it could benefit from design improvements, faster processing times, and more frequent updates. Thus, I find it adequate to give the app a 3-star rating out of 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has a pocket watch identical to the one Johnny is given? from the following article ?  Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

Fact 2: Insect Pollinators Learn about pollination and why insect pollinators are important in the garden.  Given the two facts above, what are important in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants?.? Answer:","output":"Given the two facts above, insect pollinators are important in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants.  Pollination is a crucial process in the life cycle of flowering plants, as it allows for the transfer of genetic material (pollen) from the male parts (anthers) of a flower to the female parts (stigma) of the same or another flower. This transfer of pollen is vital for plants to produce seeds, which grow into new plants, ensuring their survival and reproduction. Insect pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies, play a significant role in the pollination process. These insects visit flowers to feed on nectar and/or pollen, and in doing so, they inadvertently pick up pollen from the anthers and transfer it to the stigmas of other flowers, facilitating fertilization. Insect pollinators are important in the garden because they help in the production of fruits, vegetables, and other plant products that humans and animals rely on for food. Additionally, they contribute to the biodiversity and overall health of ecosystems, as pollination leads to the production of seeds and helps ensure the continuation of various plant species. In summary, insect pollinators are essential in the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants, as they facilitate the transfer of pollen from the male to the female parts of flowers, enabling the production of seeds and the growth of new plants. Their role in pollination directly impacts the availability of food resources for humans and wildlife, and supports the maintenance of diverse and healthy ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reviewers have noted the movie's transparent formula and schematic character roles, which contribute to its predictability and diminish its overall impact. 6. Labeling the movie as a neatly wrapped made-for-TV homily signals that the film lacks cinematic quality and depth. 7. The critiques also extend to the central love story, which is deemed unconvincing and lacking in emotional resonance. 8.

Article: From hitting the mall with your girl friends on a Saturday afternoon, to holiday spending on gifts that go under the tree, shopping could be called one of America's favorite pastimes. For most people, it means some new clothes for work or a small trinket for a friend. For others, however, shopping is much more than an enjoyable pastime, and in some cases, it is a real and destructive addiction that can turn into a financial disaster. Compulsive shopping and spending are defined as inappropriate, excessive, and out of control. Like other addictions, it basically has something to do with impulsiveness and lack of control over one's impulses. In America, shopping is embedded in our culture; so often, the impulsiveness comes out as excessive shopping. Sometimes this is referred to as \\"shopholism\\". Shopping addiction can damage a person's life, family, and finances. \\"No one knows what causes addictive behaviors, like shopping, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling\\", says a professor of applied health science. Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic predisposition to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is triggered, but no one really knows why.\\" Individuals will get some kind of high from an addictive behavior like shopping. What are the telltale signs that shopping has crossed the line and become and addiction? What should a concerned family member or friend look out for when they think shopping has become a problem? The behaviors can signal a serious problem: *Shopping or spending money as a result of feeling angry, depressed, anxious, or lonely *Having arguments with others about one's shopping habits *Feeling lost without credit cards -- actually going into withdrawal without them *Buying items on credit, rather than with cash *Describing a rush or a feeling of euphoria with spending *Feeling guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed after a spending spree  *Thinking obsessively about money *Spending a lot time juggling accounts...

Q: Question: Where was the person who Stevens worked under in 1929 born? Passage:Stevens grew up in Sydney and was an accountant and public servant before entering politics. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1927 state election, as a member of the Nationalist Party. In 1929, he was appointed state treasurer under Thomas Bavin, serving until his party lost the 1930 election. In 1932, Stevens was elected as the inaugural leader of the state branch of the UAP. He became premier later that year, following the dismissal of Labor's Jack Lang, and subsequently led his party to victory at the 1932, 1935, and 1938 elections. Stevens was ousted in 1939 and replaced by Alexander Mair. He made an abortive attempt to enter federal politics at the 1940 election, and thereafter played little part in public life.

Terrible customer service. I was quoted a price of ~40 for a battery warranty replacement over the phone.  I drove to the shop (which is 30 minutes from where i live), and was promptly greeted by a technician who tested by battery to confirm that it needed replacement.  The battery did need replacement, so a sales associate ushered me inside to pay for the new battery.  The associate selects the battery, rings up the purchase, and adds a 20 installation fee.  Up until this point, my experience had been very pleasant.  I told the associate that the price I had been quoted on the phone did not include an installation fee.  He said that it was a standard fee, and I again stated that an installation fee had not be quoted to me over the phone.  He said that I could take the battery and install it myself, but that I would have to return the old battery to the shop.  I told him that while I was happy to install the battery myself, driving 30 minutes back to their shop to return a car battery was not convenient.    He ran into the shop, to stop the technician from removing my old battery.  I waited... a different associate returned.  This new associate was pushy and abrasive.  He told me that I had two options: 1) to pay them 20 to install the battery now or 2) to pay full price (120) for a new battery, install it at home, and return the defective battery to their store (requiring an additional hour of driving on my part) to receive the warranty credit. I again told this technician that an installation fee had not been quoted to me over the phone and paying full price for the battery now to get a credit later also had not been quoted to me.  He said because I told him driving an extra hour roundtrip to return the battery was inconvenient, he would not give me the warranty credit because I was unlikely to return the defective battery.  I told the associate that neither of these choices was the option quoted to me over the phone.  He said that he didn't have a technician in the shop that was willing to work for free, so he could not waive the installation fee (although if the battery had been less than 3 yrs old instead of 3.25 yrs old, installation on replacement batteries is free).  I have no problem with installation fees as long as they are quoted to customers.  This allows the customer to make an informed decision.  Because this fee was not included in my quote, I opted to drive to Sears to get a replacement battery. IF YOU DON'T QUOTE AN INSTALLATION FEE, DON'T CHARGE ONE!  This is the mistake of the shop, not the customer, so the shop should fix it.  The associate made no attempt to correct the mistake.  Instead they were pushy and unflexible.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year.

It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Daniel Freyberg is a heavy metal guitarist and vocalist for the band Naildown and the guitarist for Children of Bodom. He is the former guitarist for Norther.   - Impaled Nazarene is a Finnish extreme metal band that started as black metal but have incorporated grindcore elements, and have grown more towards hardcore punk. The band is currently signed to Osmose Productions of France.  - Warmen is a Finnish metal band assembled by keyboard player Janne Viljami Wirman - also known as \\"Warman\\". Janne has been playing with Children of Bodom since 1997, and on the year of 2000 created a musical project focused on instrumental work, which would only have guest singers on a few selected songs.  - To/Die/For (often abbreviated \\"TDF\\") were a gothic metal band from the town of Kouvola in southeast of Finland, assembled in 1993 as a hard rock band under the name \\"Mary-Ann\\".

The band disbanded on 13 April 2009, but has reformed as of 4 July 2009, and played their final concert at John Smith Festival in Finland on June 22nd, 2016.  - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene.  - In Flames is a Swedish heavy metal band, which was formed by guitarist Jesper Strömblad in 1990 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Along with the bands At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity, In Flames was originally a metal band responsible for developing the genre now known as melodic death metal.  - Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - Kylähullut is a Finnish hardcore punk band consisting of Alexi Laiho (Children of Bodom), Tonmi Lillman (ex-To/Die/For), and Vesku Jokinen (Klamydia). The band name means \\"Village Idiots\\" in Finnish.  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. Although Norway is known for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene.  - Henri \\"Henkka T. Blacksmith\\" Seppälä (Born 7 June 1980), is the bassist of the Finnish metal band Children of Bodom. He is also responsible for backing vocals both in studio and live.  - At the Gates is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden and a major progenitor of the Gothenburg sound.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Thy Serpent is a Finnish black metal band from Espoo. It started out as a solo project by Sami Tenetz in 1992. A full lineup was acquired in 1995.   - Alexi \`\` Wildchild '' Laiho ( born Markku Uula Aleksi Laiho ; April 8 , 1979 ) is a Finnish guitarist , composer , and vocalist .

He is best known as founder and former guitarist/drummer/keyboardist of the Swedish ex-melodic death metal band In Flames, guitarist of the band Sinergy, bassist of Ceremonial Oath and drummer of HammerFall. In 2013 he joined MDM band Nightrage as a session guitarist.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Gothenburg is the second-largest city in Sweden and the fifth-largest in the Nordic countries. Situated by the Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, the city has a population of approximately 550,000 in the urban area and 990,000 inhabitants in the metropolitan area.  - Traditional heavy metal, also known as classic metal, or traditional metal, is the seminal genre of heavy metal music before the genre \\"evolved and splintered into many different styles and subgenres.\\"  - Janne Viljami \\"Warman\\" Wirman (born 26 April 1979) is a Finnish musician; he is the keyboardist for the bands Children of Bodom and Warmen.  - Espoo is the second largest city and municipality in Finland.

Espoo shares its eastern border with Helsinki and Vantaa, while enclosing Kauniainen. The city is on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, in the region of Uusimaa.  - Klamydia (Finnish language for Chlamydia) is a punk rock band from Vaasa, Finland. The band's name was chosen because it was the worst name that came to their minds. The band was assembled in 1988, and has been continuously active since then. The history of the band is long and eventful. The band publishes records in very short intervals (about one LP per year), and has experienced many line-up changes. The only remaining original member is the current vocalist, Vesa \\"Vesku\\" Jokinen. The band is notable for founding its own record company, Kråklund Records.  - Rhythm guitar is a technique and role that performs a combination of two functions: to provide all or part of the rhythmic pulse in conjunction with singers or other instruments; and to provide all or part of the harmony, i.e. the chords, where a chord is a group of notes played together. Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums.  - Kimberly Goss (born February 15, 1978) is a Korean-American singer and keyboardist, best known as frontwoman and co-founder of the Finnish metal band Sinergy.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

President Barack Obama will launch a coordinated campaign Tuesday by the White House, congressional Democrats and their outside allies to return attention to why the Affordable Care Act passed in the first place.      After two months of intense coverage of the botched HealthCare.gov rollout, the president will host a White House event kicking off a three-week drive to refocus the public on the law’s benefits, senior administration officials told POLITICO.      Text Size -      +      reset W.H. returns to Obamacare sales mode — Jim VandeHei reports In 90 secs: What's driving the day      The White House will take the lead in emphasizing a different benefit each day until the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for Jan. 1 coverage. The daily message will be amplified through press events and social media by Democratic members of Congress, the Democratic National Committee, congressional campaign committees and advocacy organizations, officials said.      (Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)      The fresh push is an attempt to get back to the game plan that Democrats wanted to pursue before the faulty website forced them into full-time damage control. The president needs to rebuild confidence in the law among the public and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, who have threatened to roll back aspects of Obamacare if the insurance marketplace didn’t improve quickly — and refocus attention on what would be lost if it were repealed.      Now that the website appears to be mostly functional, the West Wing thinks it has the ability to return to sales mode.      “Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline and even as we continue to make improvements to the website, we’ll also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans today,” said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman. “The benefits of these consumer protections will only accumulate in the weeks and months ahead.”      (POLITICO Magazine: How the media missed the two biggest Obamacare screw-ups)      Obama won’t declare the website fixed during Tuesday’s event. White House officials acknowledge HealthCare.gov still isn’t working as smoothly as it should, and that this renewed messaging push will run alongside efforts to make further repairs to the insurance marketplace and to target key populations for enrollment.      But he will return to a theme he first pursued in October: Obamacare is more than a website.      “What the White House is doing is what the White House had hoped they would spend the last two months doing, which is going out, selling the law, selling the benefits of the law,” said a former Obama adviser who framed the shift as a sign of White House confidence. “The fact that they feel comfortable doing that is a healthy sign for the president but also for the long-term benefits of Obamacare.”      Republicans aren’t expected back down from their campaign to weaken the law, and officials said they have been preparing for the Democratic offensive.      “Democrats will spend the next year promising to ‘fix’ ObamaCare, but they’ve already lost all credibility with voters,” said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which has already cut a web ad aimed at vulnerable Democrats that concludes with the message: “They can’t be trusted to keep their promises.”      (PHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout)      The focus on Obamacare benefits is a political necessity for congressional Democrats, the large majority of whom will face voters in less than a year. Democrats wrote and passed the law in the face of unified Republican opposition, and if voters aren’t aware of the law’s upside — or can’t remember it amid all the problems with the rollout — Democrats will be holding onto an anchor rather than a buoy.      Democrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill say that in order to get back on offense on Obamacare, they have to draw a two-sided picture: Democrats delivering benefits on one side, and Republicans trying to deny them on the other. That, one party operative said, is what polling says will help them win. Instead, Democrats have spent the past two months blaming a president of their own party for the deficiencies of a law that they own.      Now, Democratic leaders are welcoming the renewed White House push.      “The consequences of Republican repeal are exactly the case that we need to be making — because Republican repeal would take us backward to a broken system that hurts too many Americans — like forcing millions of seniors to pay 1,200 more for their prescription drugs,” said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Every poll tells us that when we make that case, voters choose Democrats.”      On Wednesday, the White House and Democratic allies will focus on how Americans are paying less for preventative care under Obamacare. On Thursday, they’ll highlight that people with preexisting conditions can no longer be charged more or denied coverage. And on Friday, they’ll emphasize the slowing growth in health care costs.      ”We are able to hit reset on the conversation,” said Lori Lodes, senior vice president of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. “We have to make sure people understand how the law will benefit them.”      Follow @politico ||||| President Obama declared Tuesday that ObamaCare \\"is working\\" and that \\"we're not going back,\\" as the White House looked to reboot its efforts to sell Americans on the president's signature healthcare law.      ADVERTISEMENT      Obama said that \\"poor execution\\" of the rollout of HealthCare.gov had \\"clouded\\" the benefits of the bill but said he would not allow technical glitches to undermine a program that was providing financial security for many Americans.      \\"If I've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works, that's what we'll do,\\" Obama said.      \\"We're not repealing it as long as I'm president,\\" he added. \\"I want everybody to be clear about that. We'll make it work.\\"      The president, flanked by supporters who had benefited from aspects of the law, vacillated between a defense of his much-criticized program and a sales pitch intended to highlight some of ObamaCare's benefits for ordinary families.      Obama shared stories of individuals who had been helped by provisions of the law that provided them with free preventive care, and allowed those younger than 26 to remain on their parents' health insurance.      Acknowledging that the benefits of the program had \\"gotten lost a little bit,\\" the president urged attendees to tell their friends and families about the law's success stories.      \\"It working better now, and it's just going to keep on working better over time,\\" Obama said.      In his remarks, the president shied away from directly addressing more recent critiques of the ObamaCare website, including reports that the portal was continuing to provide insurers with error-riddled enrollment information. Obama did say that as new problems arose, the administration would address them.      \\"Whatever comes up, we're going to fix it,\\" he said, adding later that the White House had \\"learned not to make wild promises about how perfectly smooth it's going to be.\\"      The president also chastised critics of the law, saying Republicans \\"haven't presented an alternative\\" that would address flaws of the pre-ObamaCare system. He singled out Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), saying the Republican leader \\"refused to answer\\" when asked what his alternate proposal was.      \\"He just repeated 'repeal' over and over and over again,\\" Obama said.      Earlier Tuesday, McConnell said the president's \\"campaign-style event wouldn’t solve the myriad problems facing consumers under ObamaCare.\\"      “The American people have been learning about the impact ObamaCare will have on individuals and families in the form of higher premiums, disrupted insurance, and lost jobs — more broken promises from the administration. And they’re becoming increasingly aware of the fact ObamaCare is broken beyond repair,\\" McConnell said.      White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the president's event was the first of many in a \\"renewed effort to refocus the public and the public's attention on the benefits of the law.\\"      Carney said that in the coming days, the president and other White House officials would talk about existing benefits under ObamaCare, including insurance plans mandating free preventive care, ending discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and the curbed growth in healthcare costs.      The White House spokesman said that sales effort would use \\"a number of different venues,\\" including press events and Internet advertising campaigns.      \\"This is an opportunity now that the website is functioning effectively for the vast majority of users and we are seeing high volume, and high volume being handled effectively by the website, and people enrolling that it's an opportune time to talk about, again, the actual benefits that are provided by the law,\\" Carney said. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"President Barack Obama wanted to remind people about the good things that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) does for them, because there were some problems with the HealthCare.gov website when it started.

Wipe down the inner surfaces of the oven with a damp cloth to complete the cleaning process.  The high temperatures of the pyrolytic cleaning cycle carbonize food matter in the oven until it turns to a light ash, not unlike that from a cigarette or campfire. This makes it easy to sweep out with just a cloth.  For after a steam-clean cycle, simply use a damp cloth to remove the softened and loosened food material from the surfaces of the oven.

You can clean removable items while the self-cleaning cycle is completed.  For an easy way to clean oven racks that must be removed from the oven before a self-clean, soak them in the bathtub with dishwasher detergent or apply baking soda and vinegar to remove built-up stains.  Further clean the inside of the oven door only if the self-clean cycle has not removed all stains from it, and only after it has cooled completely from that cycle. Spot-clean in between self-cleaning cycles on your oven, but don’t use abrasive materials like scrubbing brushes, rough sponges, or steel wool. These and harsh soaps will scratch away the pyrolytic coating, or the special enamel, that make self-cleaning possible.  If you want to clean your oven by hand with cleaner, try a product that’s intended for use with self-cleaning ovens, like Easy Off. Or use another mild cleaner or soap with a soft cloth or sponge. You should plan to use the self-cleaning feature regularly to avoid further need for cleaning. How often you perform this cycle will depend on your oven model, so consult the owner’s manual or manufacturer.","output":"This article is about cleaning an oven after the cleaning cycle is done.

Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days. Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \\"she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year.\\" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. \\"It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there.

Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. What did Jimbob's mother do after the nursery called?

Write a text based on \\"china bans entertainment business in residential school areas\\" Text:","output":"Title: China Imposes Ban on Entertainment Business in Residential School Areas In a bold move to protect the educational environment and mental well-being of students, the Chinese government has implemented a sweeping ban on entertainment businesses operating in residential school areas. This development stems from the country's ongoing effort to prioritize education, address digital addiction, and create a healthy learning atmosphere for its young population. The decision to ban entertainment businesses in these areas was announced after the Chinese government recognized that the presence of such businesses was adversely affecting the overall academic performance of students. The ban is expected to cover a wide range of establishments, including internet cafes, gaming centers, karaoke bars, and other entertainment venues targeting children and teenagers. The move is a response to growing concerns regarding the distractions posed by digital entertainment, which has become increasingly popular among the younger generation. With access to numerous gaming platforms and streaming services, students have been found to be spending an excessive amount of time on this form of entertainment, often at the detriment of their studies, physical health, and social skills. Chinese authorities believe that this ban will significantly reduce the distractions that students face in their daily lives, allowing them to focus on their education and long-term goals. The hope is that by eliminating avenues for digital addiction in their immediate surroundings, these students will dedicate more time and effort to their studies, ultimately benefiting the nation and its workforce. The ban also comes in the wake of a larger crackdown on the gaming industry in China, with the government overhauling the regulations involving gaming and limiting the number of hours a minor can spend online gaming during the week. These new rules aim to tackle the growing issue of digital addiction and help parents guide their children to a balanced lifestyle, with a strong emphasis on academics and real-life interactions. As the government monitors and enforces these new regulations, entertainment businesses in residential school areas face closure, relocation, or heavy penalties if they continue operating in these zones. They will need to adapt to this new landscape, develop alternative strategies to survive, and ensure compliance with the new laws to avoid any serious repercussions. The entertainment industry in China will most likely undergo significant transformations to cater to this new environment. While facing potential criticism surrounding the seemingly harsh regulations and their intrusion into personal liberties, the Chinese government asserts that the overall well-being of the younger generation remains a high priority. The mission to create an environment where education is revered and students can maximize their potential is seen as an essential step towards building a prosperous future for the country. In conclusion, the ban on entertainment businesses in residential school areas is a powerful step taken by the Chinese government to address the rising issue of digital addiction and protect the educational environment of the students. This decision, albeit controversial, signifies the prioritization of a value-based education system, with potential long-term benefits for the well-being of the nation's younger generation and China's future as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose mother gave him piano lessons?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\".   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Miami Heat's Luol Deng has hit back at Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry over racist remarks he made about him during a conference call in June. The conversation, which concerned scouting reports of free agents and has just become public, included Ferry saying that Deng 'has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.' Ferry also described Deng as being 'two-faced' and accused him of being a liar and a cheat. Fighting back: Luol Deng has described his pride at his African heritage after comments by Danny Ferry. Punished: Atlanta Hawks general manager Ferry was disciplined by the team for racist remarks about Deng. Power: Michael Gearon Jr (left) and Bruce Levenson. Deng has now responded to those claims in a strongly-worded statement, describing the pride he feels towards his African heritage. 'HE HAS A LITTLE AFRICAN IN HIM,' Deng begins. 'These words were recently used to describe me. It would ordinarily make any African parent proud to hear their child recognised for their heritage. 'I'm proud to say I actually have a lot of African in me, not just 'a little.' For my entire life, my identity has been a source of pride and strength. Among my family and friends, in my country of South Sudan and across the broader continent of Africa, I can think of no greater privilege than to do what I love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage. Unfortunately, the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation. 'Concerning my free agency, the focus should purely have been on my professionalism and my ability as an athlete. Every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual, rather than be reduced to a stereotype. I am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today. I am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting. 'However, there is comfort in knowing that there are people who aren't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up. In the same way a generalization should not define a group of people, the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league. 'Ultimately, I'm thankful to be with an organisation that appreciates me for who I am and has gone out of its way to make me feel welcome.' Ever present: Deng spent a decade at the Chicago Bulls before moving to Cleveland and now Miami Heat. Ferry has been disciplined by Hawks CEO Steve Koonin but details of his punishment have not been revealed. He will remain the team's general manager. Ferry apologised for his comments on Tuesday but claimed he was only repeating what he had heard about Sudan-born Deng. 'In regards to the insensitive remarks that were used during our due diligence process, I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players,' Ferry said in the statement. 'I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process. Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it. I apologise to those I offended and to Luol, who I reached out to Monday morning.' An investigation into Ferry's comments also led to the discovery of a racist email sent by co-owner Bruce Levenson. He has since announced that he will sell his controlling stake in the team.

Bubbles blown in the air generally last longer and travel farther compared to those in the water. This is because air is less dense and offers less resistance than water. When bubbles are blown underwater, they face more resistance and quickly rise to the surface due to the force of buoyancy. On the other hand, bubbles blown in the air can float and move around more smoothly, as they face less resistance. So while air is technically less smooth than water in terms of consistency, it is a better medium for bubble-blowing because it allows for longer-lasting and more easily seen bubbles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers.

Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  But I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  What is an answer for this question: Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and the background on tropical forests, it can be determined that forest A (the tropical rainforest in Brazil) would experience higher rates of chemical weathering in comparison to forest B (the temperate forest in Germany). The main factors that contribute to the higher rates of chemical weathering in forest A include the elevated temperatures, higher insolation, and increased rainfall typically present in tropical forests. These factors promote a variety of physical and chemical processes that intensify the rate of chemical weathering. In tropical rainforests like forest A, the warm and humid conditions accelerate the breakdown of rocks and minerals. The higher temperatures drive various chemical reactions, leading to a faster rate of mineral dissolution. Moreover, the abundant rainfall in tropical rainforests enhances the infiltration of water through the soil layers, which in turn facilitates chemical weathering by dissolving minerals and transporting soluble materials. Additionally, higher temperatures and increased rainfall in forest A encourage rapid plant growth and efficient nutrient cycling. As a result, the high biomass production contributes to the higher rates of decomposition and organic matter turnover. The increased rates of decomposition lead to the release of smaller amounts of fulvic acid, which percolates through the soil, further contributing to the increased metal leaching and weathering reactions. In contrast, forest B (the temperate forest in Germany) experiences a more moderate climate with cooler temperatures and less rainfall in comparison to the tropical forest A. These conditions lead to slower chemical reactions, reduced water infiltration through the soil layers, and thus result in a lower rate of chemical weathering. To sum up, forest A, the tropical rainforest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering compared to forest B, the temperate forest in Germany, primarily due to the warmer climate, increased insolation, and abundant rainfall that facilitate a multitude of weathering processes in the tropical environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Journalists hacked Milly Dowler's phone before her body was discovered. Police say up to 5,800 people were targets of phone hacking. Article:","output":"Title: Milly Dowler Phone Hacking Scandal: A Cowardly and Shocking Breach of Privacy Introduction: The shocking revelation that a murdered teenager's phone was hacked has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, prompting widespread outrage and demands for a thorough investigation into the matter. The teenager in question, Milly Dowler, fell victim not only to a harrowing crime, but to an appalling invasion of privacy by the very media who were expected to protect her memory and her family's rights. The recent statements from both the police and Milly Dowler's family have cast a necessary light on the phone hacking scandal and demand a deeper look at this disturbing phenomenon. Hackers Target Murdered Girl's Phone: The heinous act of hacking into a murdered girl's phone has been described as \\"cowardly and shocking\\" by a representative for the Grant family. Milly Dowler, the tragic victim of this senseless crime, had her mobile phone accessed without authorization by nefarious individuals seeking personal lines of enquiry to report in their publications, or for other more sinister purposes. This disgraceful act raises questions about ethics, privacy, and the extent to which journalists are prepared to go to uncover breaking news, and what the cost is for those who are directly affected. False Hope Through Phone Hacking: Milly Dowler's mother, amongst those understandably outraged by the phone hacking scandal, has described the experience of learning about the hacking as one that gave her false hope that her daughter may still be alive. When discovering that a message on her daughter's phone had been deleted, the family initially believed this activity to be by Milly herself, resulting in a surge of hope and optimism that was cruelly and devastatingly short-lived. The realization that their daughter's phone had been hacked added a further layer of heartache and injustice to the family's suffering. Widespread Phone Hacking Investigations: Police have revealed a shocking number of phone hacking victims, placing the estimated number of people affected at up to 5,800 individuals. The enormity of this number demands prompt and thorough investigations into those responsible for these breaches of privacy and trust. As the Milly Dowler case demonstrates, the consequences of phone hacking extend far beyond the invasion of privacy and can have real emotional and psychological impacts on those targeted and their loved ones. The journalist community faces a reckoning as the extent of the ethical breaches come to light, with many questioning the very fundamental nature of the industry. Conclusion: The Milly Dowler phone hacking scandal has sparked a necessary discourse on privacy invasion and the price of unethical journalistic practices. As the investigation into the 5,800 potential victims continues, the public's faith in the media is put to the test. The consequences for those involved in the scandal will no doubt be severe, and calls for change within the journalistic community are inevitable. However, no amount of change, reflection, or reparation can undo the trauma and pain that the Dowler family experienced due to these despicable hacking actions. It is the hope of a nation that this breach of trust never repeats itself and that victims of crime and their families are shown the respect and privacy they deserve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It had to go, all of it, the bedrolls and blankets and crusty Nalgene bottles, the comfy camp accoutrements that have, over the course of four months, turned McPherson Square into a radical protest experiment, communal living cooperative and REI advertisement.      “Occupy is supposed to mean occupy,” says Eric Kovacevic, as he and a companion methodically piled garbage bags full of their assorted stuff — pillows, clothing, travel-size toiletries — outside his domed tent. “You know, like [the United States] has occupied other countries.”      Kovacevic, 28, came from Minneapolis two months ago to join the Occupy D.C. encampment off K Street NW. On Monday afternoon he was packing up, per orders from the Park Police, who had announced stricter enforcement of the ban on overnight camping. It was a complicated ban. Tents could stay. Tents counted as symbols of political protest. But not the camping equipment inside the tents, which counted as symbols that people were sleeping illegally on government property. Thus, the equipment had to be removed, and the tent flaps had to remain unzipped and the people had to remain awake. Photos: Faces of the Occupy DC movement      Kovacevic had heard a rumor about alternative sleeping arrangements, like a guy in Virginia who supposedly said he would let the protesters occupy his land. “But that’s not really the point,” Kovacevic explains.      Occupying a yard that you have been invited to stay in isn’t really occupying. It’s just being a houseguest.      And occupying a park that you’re no longer sleeping in, that no longer contains your possessions . . . is that occupying? Or is that just standing around with a protest sign?      The places that became residential symbols of the national Occupy movement — Zuccotti Park, outside L.A.’s City Hall, Denver’s Civic Center Park — became such because of their permanence. These were not drop-in protests, pop-up rallies. These people came, and they came with Coleman camp stoves. They came with mattress pads and Tempur-Pedic neck supporters. It was passion and principle that made Occupy into a protest movement. But it was sleeping bags that made it occupied. What set this movement apart from other movements? The stuff. The stuff and the sleep.      “I’ve got my sleeping bag, pillow, dried oatmeal,” says James, who runs the Radical Space library tent and declined to give his last name. He came from Orlando. “Imagine taking your medicine cabinet, your kitchen, your bathroom and putting it all in a backpack.”      The stuff allowed for the development of infrastructure, the borrowed-cup-of-sugar community that defined Occupy. The sleep created a sense of permanence. What is the future of a not-technically-occupied Occupy movement?      On Monday at McPherson Square, protesters pondered this question. “Evicted from our home by the banks. Evicted from our tents by the police. There is no safe place to rest,” read the side of one spray-painted tent.      A good many protesters opted not to remove their stuff at all. As the noon deadline set by the police approached and then passed, the stuff that had enabled the protesters to endure a winter in Washington — the fox-den hidey-holes of cold-weather whatnot — remained defiantly inside tents. To the office dwellers who came to the park to see what would transpire as the deadline approached, the site looked little changed from the encampment that had sprung up in early October. It was muddy and cluttered. Protesters rallied at the center of the square, engaging in call-and-response chants, and digging in their heels for a stand-off with police that, as of mid-afternoon, had not occurred (the mood was reportedly less raucous and more zen over at Freedom Plaza, the site of Washington’s second Occupy encampment).      Several Occupiers erected a blue, billowing “Tent of Dreams” over the statue of Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, allowing ear holes for the general’s horse and one for the general’s head. “Let us sleep so we can dream,” they began chanting, which gave the impression that what everyone really needed was economic equality, Ambien and a pair of slippers.      “People will be catnapping their way through this,” says Eric Lotke, a middle-aged attorney and protester, discussing strategies for keeping the park “Occupied” without being “occupied.” “The micro-tactical question of what happens to the camp doesn’t really matter.”      “The court says tents are part of the protest,” says Bob Jansen, 18, as he distributed copies of the camp’s official newspaper, the Occupied Washington Times. “But we can’t sleep here, and I feel sleeping itself is a protest statement.”      As the afternoon passed, police arrived to take inventory of protesters’ equipment, and spectators arrived to gawk in the chilly, brilliant weather. Many protesters said they would sleep nearby or bunk with friends and return to the encampment in the daylight.      Some believed that the new enforcements would not alter the ultimate meaning that McPherson Square has come to hold in the local Occupy movement.      “It’s impacting the physical location but not the spiritual location,” says John Zangas. “I have books. It’s going to be a place for meditation and reading,” he said of his tent.      “There,” he says, wiping the inside of the structure down with a Clorox wipe. “Now I’ve come under full compliance.”      When asked where he plans to spend the night, Zangas, who has a communications job in Washington, looked briefly confused.      “I’m going to be sleeping in my apartment in D.C.” ||||| Story highlights A man attempts to tear down the \\"tent of dreams\\" tarp; protesters stop him      A federal judge denies a restraining order on the camping ban      Washington protesters vow to stay strong despite a sleepless night      Over the weekend, protesters and police also clashed in Oakland, California      Living in a public park as a means of protest is not protected by the First Amendment, a federal judge said Tuesday in rejecting an Occupy DC demonstrator's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping.      Dane Charles Primarano sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting the National Park Service and its police department from taking action against protesters found sleeping in or in possession of camping gear in Washington's McPherson Park and Freedom Square.      Primarano, who represented himself, argued that camping at the park is a form of constitutionally protected free speech. Judge James Boasberg disagreed, saying it is a matter of public policy, not constitutional law.      The setback for protesters came on the first full day of the camping ban enforced by U.S. Park Police. Authorities told protesters Monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials but could keep their tents so long as one flap remains open at all times.      Protesters said Tuesday that police had told them they had \\"a few hours\\" to remove a large blue tarp they had draped over a statue of the park's namesake, Civil War Gen. James B. McPherson. Protesters have dubbed the tarp, covered with stars, the \\"tent of dreams.\\"      They decided later to let police decide what to do with the tarp. Authorities did not immediately remove it.      Separately, a man attempted to tear the tarp down. He was stopped by protesters. Another man, or perhaps the same man, later cut some of the ropes holding up the tarp. He was removed by police. The tarp remained up.      Protesters who had struggled to stay awake overnight vowed to stay strong early Tuesday.      \\"I had more fun in the park last night than the whole time I've been here,\\" said demonstrator Amanda Rickard. \\"We were out here playing guitar, singing, playing drums, Scrabble, card games, you know, just stuff to keep us busy so we can stay here and stay awake.\\"      But one protester said he wouldn't be surprised if the mandate against camping gear and sleeping in the park takes its toll on protesters.      \\"To be honest, I don't know how long we can keep this up,\\" Kevin Wiley said after a sleepless night.      It was clear protesters did not like the rules. \\"No justice, no sleep,\\" one protester scrawled on a tent.      Another sign, written in white paint on a blue tarp, said: \\"Evicted from home by the banks. Evicted from the tent by the police. 99% has no safe place to rest.\\"      But Wiley said they were trying to abide by the rules to \\"show we are law-abiding citizens.\\"      \\"We're not out here just trying to have a good time. We are out here for a political message,\\" he said.      Protesters had made arrangements to sleep off-site in shifts, said Rickard, who acknowledged nodding off for about 10 minutes overnight.      In another court hearing Tuesday on a case brought by Occupy DC protesters, Boasberg said he would rule within two days on a request that park officials be prohibited from seizing tents and other property without evidence of a crime, an emergency or a warrant.      Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread across the country.      While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite.      On Monday, City Hall in Oakland, California, reopened after a violent weekend clash between police and protesters that resulted in about 400 arrests. Authorities said protesters broke into the building and committed acts of vandalism inside.      Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, also dismantled several tents at an Occupy camp there.      \\"We're doing the right thing, peacefully and quietly,\\" protester Malachi Vinson told CNN affiliate WCNC. \\"We're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"This article talks about a time when people were protesting and living in a park called McPherson Square.

Some protesters moved their stuff and some tried to find other places to sleep while still being part of the protest. The police and the protesters weren't sure what to do with a big blue tarp that they had put over a statue in the park, but they decided to leave it for now.

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

One Saturday afternoon last month, six second graders from P.S. 295 in Brooklyn got a head start on the fine-dining life when they visited the acclaimed French restaurant Daniel. There, five waiters presented them with a seven-course tasting menu (after the trio of canapés and an amuse-bouche, naturellement). The meal was overseen by the star chef and eponym himself, Daniel Boulud, whose goal was, he says, “for the children to really discover a lot of flavor, a lot of layers, a lot of texture.” These discoveries included Smoked Paprika Cured Hamachi (the “most-foreign thing for them,” Boulud says), Crispy Japanese Snapper (“which they loved to see”) and Wagyu Beef Rib-Eye (“a big success”). To capture the children’s reactions, the magazine asked Jeffrey Blitz, the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Spellbound,” to make a video. The initiates seemed to enjoy the experience, but that isn’t to say they loved all those flavors and textures.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Why do Indians think a lot about what others think? Why do Indians care so much about what others think about them? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"To answer the first part of your query, I will provide reasons why Indians may think a lot about what others think: Step 1: Identify cultural and societal values in India - Importance of collectivism: Unlike individualistic societies, Indians place a high value on the collective identity which includes family, caste, and community. This can lead to increased concern about social standing, reputation, and the opinions of others. Step 2: Consider the influence of tradition and familial expectations - Strong emphasis on family expectations: In India, families uphold traditional values, and there is an expectation to adhere to these values. Fulfilling responsibilities and meeting familial expectations are considered crucial, and the opinions of others on how well one is doing so can hold significant weight. Step 3: Reflect on the significance of social harmony - Maintaining social harmony: Indian society values maintaining harmony within the community. To ensure social stability, individuals may avoid conflict or confrontation by adhering to societal norms and adjusting their behavior according to the expectations of others. Now, I will answer your second question about why Indians care so much about what others think about them: The reasons for caring about what others think can inherently be derived from the same cultural and societal values I mentioned for the first question. The importance of collectivism, tradition, familial expectations, and the significance of social harmony all contribute to the reason why Indians may care about what others think about them. Lastly, I will evaluate if the two questions are the same: Upon analysis, the first question asks for a reason behind the thought process of Indians regarding the opinions of others. The second question is asking about the reasons for caring about those opinions. While the two questions might seem similar, they are not exactly the same. The first question focuses on the cognitive aspect (thinking about what others think), while the second question is about the emotional aspect (caring about what others think). However, the answers to both questions are interconnected and draw upon similar cultural, societal, and historical factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: The photo and video stream of Color CEO Bill Nguyen, which security researcher Chris Wysopal accessed in seconds by spoofing his iPad's location. For anyone sketched out by the privacy implications of Color, the highly hyped, highly funded, and highly public iOS and Android social media app that launched last week, now would be a good time to ratchet your creep-o-meter up another notch or two. Within hours of Color’s release last Thursday, security researcher and Veracode chief technology officer Chris Wysopal wrote on Twitter that with “trivial geolocation spoofing” the authentication model of Color is “broken.” Over the weekend, he put that idea to the test. Using a jailbroken iPad and an app called FakeLocation, Wysopal was able to set his device’s location to anywhere in the world. Launching Color a moment later, he found, as predicted, that he could see all the photos of any person at that location. “This only took about five minutes to download the FakeLocation app and try a few locations where I figured there would be early adopters who like trying out the latest apps,” Wysopal wrote to me in an email. “No hacking involved.” Wysopal is based in New York, but he sent me photos that he grabbed by hopping between Harvard, MIT, NYU, and then to Color’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, where he accessed the photo and video stream of Color’s chief executive Bill Nguyen. Wysopal’s screenshot of Nguyen’s photo stream is pictured above. Wysopal points out how useful that combination might be for paparazzi hoping to jump into exclusive locations anywhere in the world. “Which celeb nightclub do you want to spy on,” writes Wysopal, “The Box, Bungalow 8, Soho Grand?” FakeLocation allows you to jump to MIT's campus in a second. When I reached Color spokesman John Kuch, he answered with Color’s usual line on privacy: That it has never claimed to offer any. “It is all public, and we’ve been very clear about that from the very beginning. Within the app, there’s already functionality to look through the entire social graph. Very few people will probably do what you’re saying, but all the pictures, all the comments, all the videos are out there for the public to see.” (A relevant aside: As my privacy-focused colleague Kashmir Hill points out, that’s me and her in the image used on Color’s homepage and in the app store. No one ever asked our permission to use the photo. Not much of a privacy violation there, given that we were doing an early test of the app with Color’s execs, but a funny example of how Color thinks–or doesn’t–about privacy.) Color does, of course make everything public. But to access someone’s photos, a user generally has to be in the same geographic vicinity as another user, or cross paths with someone else who is connected to that user. With Wysopal’s trick, we can all start looking at Bill Nguyen’s photos immediately. Color’s founders have talked about adding a functionality called something like “peeking,” which would allow users to jump into a location or a user’s photostreams. But that peek would likely be limited in time and require the approval of whoever’s stream the user jumped into, Color’s staff has said. Wysopal’s trick, on the other hand, functions as an unrestricted peek anywhere without that permission. He suggests that one fix for the problem would be to track how quickly users travel between locations. Jumping between Boston, New York, and Palo Alto in a few seconds isn’t physically possible, so perhaps Color could track that sort of quick hopping to “detect obvious geo-spoofers,” Wysopal writes. But given Color’s attitude about privacy, it’s not clear they’ll want to add that safeguard. Don’t be surprised if this “everything-is-public” startup sees universal photo and video peeking as a feature, not a bug.

He opens the fridge and takes out sandwich ingredients. he Choices: [a]. then takes a bite and mixes the ingredients together with the sandwich.; [b]. takes one of them and cuts open the sandwich.; [c]. squirts mustard and mayo onto the sandwich.; [d]. then stuffs his mouth with the sandwich ingredients.; The answer is:","output":"[c]. squirts mustard and mayo onto the sandwich. In this situation, the boy is preparing a sandwich. The most common and sensible action among these choices for making a sandwich would be to apply condiments like mustard and mayo onto the bread. This is why option [c] is correct. [a] is incorrect because the boy would not take a bite and then mix the ingredients together with the sandwich; rather, he would prepare the sandwich first before eating it. [b] is incorrect because the boy wouldn't need to cut open the sandwich since he already has two pieces of bread, which are used to create a sandwich by putting ingredients in between them. [d] is incorrect because it is unlikely for someone to stuff their mouth with sandwich ingredients instead of putting them on the bread to make a sandwich."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks?  Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Article: Astronauts aboard the space station celebrated a space first on Wednesday by drinking water that had been recycled from their urine , sweat and water got from air. They said \\"cheers,\\" clicked drinking bags and toasted NASA workers on the ground. The urine recycling system is needed for astronaut stations on the moon and Mars. It also will have NASA money because it won't have to ship up as much water to the station by space shuttles or cargo rockets. Besides, it's important as the space station is about to expand from three people living on board to six. The recycling system had been brought up to the space station last November by space shuttles Endeavour, but it couldn't be used until samples  were tested back on earth. So when it came time to actually drink up, NASA made a big deal of it. The three-man crew stood holding their drinks and congratulated engineers in two NASA centres that worked on the system. \\"This is something that had been the stuff of science fiction,\\" American astronaut Michael Barratt said before taking a small mouthful. \\"The taste is worth trying.\\" The new system takes the combined urine of the crew from the toilet, moves it to a big tank, where the water is boiled off, and the vapor  is collected. The rest of the urine is thrown away. Then the water vapor is mixed with water from air, and then it goes through filters  . When six crew members are aboard it can make about six gallons from urine in about six hours. \\"Some people may find the idea of drinking recycled urine distasteful, but it is also done on earth, but with a lot longer time between urine and the tap,\\" said Marybeth Edeen, the space station's national lab manager. The technology NASA developed for this system has already been used for quick water purification after the 2004 Asian tsunami. Question: What did Edeen say about recycled urine and the recycling system? Options: A: The taste of recycled urine is not as good as that of common water. B: The recycling system has made a science fiction story come true. C: The idea of drinking recycled urine makes astronauts feel unpleasant. D: It takes a longer time on earth to make water from urine than in space.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet.

The woman is wearing a white shirt and shorts. 3. The woman is playing a red guitar. However, the statement \\"A woman is performing a guitar solo\\" carries implications that cannot be supported solely by the provided information. Here's a breakdown of the implied details in this statement: 1. The subject in question is a woman (consistent with the given information). 2. The woman is playing a guitar (consistent with the given information). 3. The woman is presently the only one performing (not explicitly stated in the given information). 4. The performance is focused on the woman's guitar playing, as opposed to her singing or participating in an ensemble, for example (not explicitly stated in the given information).

For instance, we cannot ascertain the context or setting of the woman's guitar playing, the presence of other musicians, or the nature of her performance from just the provided information. Without knowing the specifics of her performance or musical setting, we cannot conclude that the woman is actually performing a guitar solo; she may be playing with a group, practicing by herself, or even teaching a lesson, among numerous other possibilities.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where in the castle was the last room that was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan?  In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work.  The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action.

The tire   made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car. I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling  at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy. So I asked, \\"Why did you just do that? This guy almost sent us to hospital. \\" This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call \\"The Law of the Rubbish Truck   . \\" He explained that many people are like rubbish trucks. They run around full of rubbish, full of anger and full of bad feelings. As their rubbish piles up, they look for a place to throw it away and sometimes they'll throw it at you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their rubbish and spread it to other people at work, at home or on the streets. Successful people never let rubbish trucks change their moods  . Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love those who love you and pray  for those who don't. Question: A car accident nearly happened on the writer's way to the   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"airport\\"?

Halloween III is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist Michael Myers, nor does it include story elements from either Halloween (1978) or Halloween II (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as fictional films, as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. It also departs from the slasher genre which the first two installments were part of, instead featuring a \`\`witchcraft'' theme with science fiction aspects and parallels to old Celtic fairy tales. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the Halloween series had the potential to branch into an anthology series of horror films that centered around the night of Halloween, with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated that there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that Season of the Witch was meant to be the first of the anthology series. However, after the film's disappointing critical reception and box-office gross, Michael Myers was brought back six years later in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: does michael myers come out in halloween 3?","output":"No, sweetie, Michael Myers does not come out in Halloween 3.

Various human activities and industrial processes release pollutants into natural water sources. Here's the revised and complete process: 1. Various human activities and industrial processes release pollutants into natural water sources. 2. The pollution negatively affects the water quality. 3. The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals. 4. The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives. 5. The plants and animals do not reproduce very well. 6. The number of plants and animals decreases over time. 7. The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it. 8. Eventually, there is nothing living in the water, and it becomes unusable. This process illustrates the dire consequences of water pollution on the environment and the ecosystem. It starts with human activities and industrial processes introducing harmful substances, such as chemicals, heavy metals, and waste, into the water. These pollutants have negative impacts on the water quality, making it less suitable for the survival and well-being of aquatic plants and animals. As a result of the pollution, plants and animals suffer from various health issues, leading to shorter and less healthy lives. This, in turn, means they will not reproduce as efficiently, causing a decline in their numbers over time. With fewer living organisms present, the water quality worsens further, as plants and animals play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and filtering water naturally. In the final stage of this process, the water becomes so polluted and lacking in diversity and life, that it reaches a point where it is no longer usable or suitable for any living organisms. Ecosystems that once thrived in the area now cease to exist, which may have a ripple effect on other systems and species connected to these water sources. Ultimately, this process underscores the importance of paying attention to, and addressing, the factors contributing to water pollution, in order to preserve the ecological balance and protect the health and well-being of plants, animals, and humans who rely on water resources for survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What word became a derogatory term by 1915?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. A:","output":"Based on the provided context, the word that became a derogatory term by 1915 is \\"Victorian.\\" This can be inferred from the statement, \\"by 1915 the word 'Victorian' had become a derogatory term.\\" This shift in perception was likely due to changing tastes in art and literature, as well as societal attitudes towards what was considered appropriate or outdated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Lucy Crossley Fierce floods have forced almost 13,000 from their homes in the World Cup host state of Parana as it prepares to host its first game on Monday. Officials from the southern Brazilian state's civil defence department said flooding had struck 132 cities, including the state capital of Curitiba - a host city for the football tournament. It is currently unclear if flooding has affected the Arena da Baixada stadium, which will host the first of its four games on Monday when Iran take on Nigeria.

The situation in Parana has quickly become a cause for concern among the international community, as thousands of people remain displaced due to the severe floods. Local officials and public workers in Curitiba have been working tirelessly to manage the crisis, ensuring that those affected receive necessary support while keeping the city's activities running smoothly for visiting fans and teams, such as Iran and Nigeria. While the Arena da Baixada has not yet been directly affected by the flooding, the situation remains precarious as the stadium prepares to host important matches. The city of Curitiba and the Brazilian government have prioritized the safety and well-being of both the residents and the visiting teams, demonstrating their commitment to hosting a successful event. Aside from causing havoc in cities across the state of Parana, the heavy rains have also led to a unique phenomenon - the Iguazu Falls, a popular tourist attraction near the border of Brazil and Argentina, is experiencing an unprecedented increase in water flow. The remarkable sight has drawn tourists and journalists alike, including Lucy Crossley, who has been diligently following the developments in the region. As the World Cup matches continue to unfold in the host state of Parana, teams from countries such as Spain are also closely monitoring the situation. Although their matches are not scheduled to be held in the flood-affected areas, the Spanish team has expressed their solidarity with those impacted by the floods, acknowledging the collective effort needed to overcome such challenges. In conclusion, the fierce floods in the southern Brazilian state of Parana have caused widespread devastation and despair, with individuals like Lucy Crossley continuing to document the situation. While the authorities are doing their best to alleviate the ongoing crisis and ensure that the World Cup games in the area remain unaffected, it is crucial for the international community to stand together in support of the people of Parana, the city of Curitiba, and the beleaguered Brazilian government as they tackle this daunting challenge head-on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

Question: What did Demetrius do before invading Thessaly? Context: After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

Questions: The key to living life and not just existing is what? Options: - acquiring knowledge - happiness - purpose - existing - joy A:","output":"The key to living life and not just existing is purpose. It's beyond the limitations of acquiring knowledge, happiness, joy, or simply existing. It's about making full use of the knowledge and emotional capabilities we possess, and applying them in the most meaningful way, which is through our purpose. Firstly, let's explore what it means to exist versus what it means to truly live life. Existing can be seen as just going through the motions of life without much thought or consideration. You're merely reacting to life and allowing it to happen to you, rather than making active choices. It's like floating aimlessly in a vast ocean without a specific destination. On the other hand, living life implies being actively engaged in your existence. It entails passion, livelihood, fulfilment, and growth. Living life is not merely about existing but operating in a dynamic, meaningful, conscious, and intentional manner. While acquiring knowledge is a fundamental part of human life and growth, it isn't enough to facilitate an experience of living. Knowledge-led living can still churn out a monotonous life if there's no motivation or objective for its application. It's not the acquisition of knowledge that defines life; it's what you do with that knowledge. Similarly, happiness and joy are essential components of a rich, fulfilling life, but they aren't decisive factors either. Just as sadness and pain are part of life, so too are joy and happiness. But to live a life defined solely by the pursuit of happiness ignores the range of human experiences and emotions that contribute to a full, well-rounded life. Furthermore, simply choosing \\"existing\\" as the key to living life wouldn't differ from the state of simply being, which is contrary to the question's purpose. On the contrary, a purpose-driven life goes beyond just existing or experiencing feelings or gaining knowledge. Purpose provides a direction, a cause to fight for, a reason to get out of the bed each morning with determination and enthusiasm. It offers a broader perspective where happiness, joy, and knowledge have their roles to play, but they aren't the final destination. Purpose invokes a sense of belonging and helps bridge the gap between your inner self and the external world. It helps to make sense of our lives, provides a context for our experiences, and gives us a clear sense of direction. When we live a purposeful life, we become proactive. We strive to make changes in our lives and the world around us rather than simply reacting to life as it happens. This is why purpose is seen as the key to truly living life as opposed to simply existing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\"?

Manziel performed well during spring ball and fall practices and won the starting job over Jameill Showers and Matt Joeckel before the season began. His first game was supposed to be against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana on Thursday, August 30, 2012, but the game was postponed until October 13 due to Hurricane Isaac hitting the Louisiana coast two days prior to game time. Consequently, Manziel's college football debut was played as a redshirt freshman against the Florida Gators before a home crowd at Kyle Field.  Although Manziel began the season in relative obscurity, his play against Arkansas in which he broke Archie Manning's 43-year-old total offense record gained him some attention. Manziel produced 557 yards of total offense, breaking Manning's record of 540. Two games later, Manziel surpassed his own total offense record against #24 Louisiana Tech by achieving 576 yards of total offense, becoming the first player in SEC history to have two 500+ total offense games in one season. After Texas A&M's blowout of Auburn in the eighth game of the season, in which Manziel accounted for 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns through only the first half plus one series in the second, Manziel began showing up in national Heisman Watch lists.  Manziel was launched into the national scene after he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In that game, Manziel accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. In the following days, Manziel became the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy in most national watch lists and polls due to his performance during the game combined with other Heisman frontrunners faltering.  On November 24, during the game against the Missouri Tigers before a home crowd, Manziel left the game with an apparent knee injury late in the first quarter. He returned to the field for the next series of downs wearing a knee brace and finished the game with 439 yards of total offense, including 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns. During the game, he broke the single season record for offensive production in the SEC with 4,600 yards, surpassing Cam Newton and Tim Tebow, notable recent Heisman Trophy winners. He also became the first freshman and only the fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3000 and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, reaching that mark two games earlier than any other player. He won the SEC Freshman of the Year Award and College Football Performance National Freshman of the Year Award. Manziel won the Davey O'Brien Award on December 6 and the Heisman Trophy on December 8, making him the first freshman ever to win either award. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: which team did he play against the best?","output":"It is difficult to pinpoint the single best team Johnny Manziel played against, as he had several outstanding performances throughout his college football career. However, one could argue that Manziel's performance against #1 Alabama in 2012 stands out as a significant achievement. In that game, he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over Alabama in Tuscaloosa and accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. This performance launched Manziel into the national spotlight and made him the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy, which he eventually won. As Alabama was ranked #1 at the time and had a strong football program, it can be considered one of the best teams Manziel played against."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who is said to have had a heart attack?  In 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who is said to have had a heart attack is Dieter Vogel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 House Republicans and 41 out of 47 Senate Republicans had signed ATR's \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\", in which the pledger promises to \\"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\\"  The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to \\"fewer than ... 218\\" in the House of Representatives. According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the \\"fiscal cliff\\" have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist.  In November 2011, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed Norquist's influence for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction's lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans \\"are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They're giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader.\\" Since Norquist's pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican deficit hawks now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction. Former Republican Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), co-chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, has been particularly critical, describing Norquist's position as \\"[n]o taxes, under any situation, even if your country goes to hell.\\" Answer this question \\"Was there anything else significant about the pledge?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there was something else significant about the pledge. The pledge made it difficult for Republicans to compromise on deficit reduction agreements because it bound them to oppose any increase in tax revenue.

The album marks the end of a three-and-a-half-year hiatus for the group with the return of original lead vocalist Anthony Green. It also marks the subsequent departure of lead guitarist Justin Shekoski. Can we draw the following conclusion? Anthony Green left the group during 2012.","output":"Based on the information provided, Along the Shadow is the third studio album by American rock band Saosin, which was released on May 20, 2016, through Epitaph Records. This album marked the end of a three-and-a-half-year hiatus for the group, with the return of original lead vocalist Anthony Green. Furthermore, this album also witnessed the departure of lead guitarist Justin Shekoski. To draw the conclusion that Anthony Green left the group during 2012, we need to consider the three-and-a-half-year hiatus mentioned. It can be inferred that the hiatus started in 2012, as 2016 (the year of the album's release) minus 3.5 years approximately equals 2012. However, we cannot directly conclude that Anthony Green left the group in 2012 solely based on this information. To provide more context, Anthony Green initially departed from Saosin in 2004 and later rejoined the band in 2014. The hiatus mentioned in the original information likely refers to Saosin's period of inactivity between albums, not necessarily Anthony Green's absence from the band. While Anthony returned to the band in 2014, it would be incorrect to conclude that he left the group in 2012 based on the provided details. In conclusion, although the three-and-a-half-year hiatus corresponds to the timeline between 2012 and the release of Along the Shadow in 2016, we cannot directly conclude that Anthony Green left the group in 2012, as he had actually left the band in 2004 and later rejoined in 2014."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My date and I get to the restaurant around 6pm. We wanted sushi and this is an Asian Fusion place, so we figured we could get some decent Maki rolls. Half the tables in the restaurant are empty. The host asks if we have a reservation. We don't, so she says the only accommodations she can offer is at the counter. We take two seat at the end.   Our server comes around and asks if we want drinks. We don't feel like drinking and say 'no thank you'. Although the server was nice to us, I could secretly feel like he was annoyed that he knew he would be getting a check much smaller than average check.

Movie plot: CONTIENE SPOILERS La película trata la historia de dos atracadores y ladrones de coches (el Mini y el Meca), que conocen a una chica (Ángela). Planean nuevos atracos para los que necesitan otro miembro en su pequeña banda, así que introducen en el grupo a un conocido de ellos (el Sebas). También se relacionan con una amiga de Ángela, María, pero que no participa en los atracos. En los atracos, Ángela participa disfrazada de varón. La película retrata el modus vivendi de los delincuentes, el consumo de drogas, su relación con la policía (como cuando pasean por el Cerro de los Ángeles en Getafe y les piden la documentación y se tienen que deshacer de la droga que llevan encima). De día duermen, cometen algún atraco con el que vivir y comprar droga, y por la noche, van a la discoteca a bailar y drogarse. No tienen responsabilidades, así que si en medio de un colocón de droga les apetece coger el coche y recorrer 500 Km para ir a la playa, lo hacen. Tampoco les importa conducir drogados o mientras fuman porros. El coche no es suyo, ya que es robado, el dinero que se gastan también es robado. Y si se les acaba, siempre pueden robar de nuevo. Cuando no están drogados y tienen dinero, pueden parecer unos chicos normales que sólo quieren divertirse. Por ejemplo, salen a dar un paseo montados a caballo por el barrio de Villaverde Alto (de donde son originarios los actores en la vida real). Les advierten de que tengan cuidado con los caballos y de que no crucen la carretera con ellos. Y eso prometen, pero en cuanto están drogados, nada les importa, ni siquiera que se les escapen los caballos que les han prestado.

Write an article using the following points: Michael Evans on organization to forge friendships in Northern Ireland. He put Protestant and Catholic high school students on one team. Even after graduating from school, the former teammates are still friends. The friends communicate via Internet because it's too dangerous to visit. Article:","output":"Title: Michael Evans' Initiative Transforms High School Rivalries into Lifelong Friendships in Northern Ireland Introduction: In a region where sectarianism has often been the cause of tension and violence, Michael Evans, a visionary educator, has created a groundbreaking organization that aims to forge friendships between Protestant and Catholic high school students in Northern Ireland. His innovative approach of uniting students on one team, regardless of their religious backgrounds, has sparked meaningful connections that persist beyond high school. These bonds of friendship endure despite the challenges the friends face in their everyday lives, as they bridge the sectarian divide through online communication when physical meetings are too dangerous. Step 1: Establishing the organization and its goals Michael Evans, a passionate advocate for social change in Northern Ireland, founded the organization with a vision of creating opportunities for young people from different backgrounds to forge lasting friendships. He recognized that in order to overcome the deep-rooted divisions that have haunted the region for generations, transformative action needed to take place at the grassroots level. By bringing together students from different religious backgrounds and providing them with a shared platform to form meaningful relationships, Evans hoped to foster a sense of unity and understanding that would radiate beyond the immediate circle of participants. Step 2: Uniting students through a shared experience In a bold move, Evans put Catholic and Protestant high school students on one team, enabling them to work closely and develop a bond through their common interests and shared goals. This approach was a stark departure from the usual separation of these groups, which often led to animosity and mistrust. By promoting collaboration and cooperation between members of each religious group, Evans' organization facilitated the gradual breakdown of barriers that had previously kept young people from forming meaningful friendships across religious lines. Step 3: Fostering communication beyond high school As the former teammates graduated from high school, many of them went on to pursue different paths in life. Despite the geographical distance and the challenges they faced in their respective communities, the bonds they had formed during their time on the team remained strong. Thanks to the Internet, these friends have been able to maintain regular communication, providing them with a continued sense of support and camaraderie. Even when it is too dangerous to visit one another due to the ongoing tensions in Northern Ireland, they can rely on virtual channels to keep their friendships alive. Conclusion: Michael Evans' innovative approach to fostering friendships between Protestant and Catholic high school students in Northern Ireland is a testament to the transformative power of unity and collaboration. By breaking down the barriers that have historically separated these groups, his organization has demonstrated that true bonds of friendship can transcend divisive lines and persist in the face of adversity. As the former teammates continue to forge a path of understanding and mutual respect, they serve as trailblazers, embodying a hopeful future for a more inclusive and peaceful Northern Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Professor Anthony Hilton from Ashton University, UK, tested the rule with his students.They found that food dropped for five seconds is less likely to contain bacteria  than if it sits there for longer. For the study, Hilton and his students tested a lot of foods----bread, pasta, cookies and candy--to see how much bacteria they had when they made contact with the floor.They allowed the food to lie on the different types of flooring--carpet , laminate   and tile  -- for three seconds to 30 seconds. Not surprisingly, the longer the food was on the floor, the more bacteria it had.And the type of floor where the dropped food landed had an effect.Bacteria are least likely to transfer  from carpet, while they are most likely to transfer laminate or tiled surface after more than five seconds. The study also found that the wetter the food, the more likely it was to pick up bacteria.Although most people are happy to follow the 5-second rule, eating food dropped on the floor still carries an infection  risk.\\"It very much depends on which bacteria are on the floor at the time.\\" Hilton told Forbes. According to the test, we learn the following EXCEPT   _  . A) the dropped food had more bacteria if it sat on the floor for longer. B) the dropped food on the carpet had the least bacteria. C) bacteria was impossible to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces. D) the wetter food was likely to pick up bacteria.

After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform.  Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading.

Context: Understanding the context is crucial in determining the veracity of the hypothesis. In this case, the context refers to the circumstances or reasons surrounding the idea of having to sell the prize. These might include financial struggles, the prize's irrelevance to the person, or personal preferences driving the decision. However, the premise does not provide enough context to determine the reasons behind selling the prize. 2. Information given: The premise \\"yeah right so I'll probably have to sell the prize I get\\" implies that the individual thinks they are likely to sell the prize they receive. However, we do not have any specific information about the prizes offered in the draw, the probability of winning, or why they anticipate having to sell the prize. Therefore, the given information is insufficient to determine the hypothesis's truth conclusively. 3. Assumptions made: When analyzing the premise, we can identify an assumption that the individual has a need or motivation to sell the prize. However, this assumption is not verified, as we do not know the specifics surrounding this need or motivation. Moreover, there might be other unstated assumptions at play (e.g., their belief about the prizes' suitability or their likelihood of winning).

Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used. Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes. Be consistent while taking children's differences into account. Include all family members in money management discussions, decision making, and activities suitable for their age. Explan to children what they can and cannot do and the consequences of going above the limits. As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences. Expect all family members to perform unpaid, routine household work based on their abilities. Express your desire to have things you can't afford.

Answer the question...where does the flat iron cut of meat come from??","output":"The flat iron cut of meat is a relatively recent discovery in the culinary world. It comes from the chuck section of a cow. To be more specific, it is carved from the shoulder area, which is often referred to as the shoulder top blade in butchery terminology. This piece of meat is nestled just above the shoulder blade, making it a part of the primal cut known as the beef chuck. The beef chuck is a subprimal cut that includes the first through the fifth ribs and the shoulder blade.  Now, despite originating from the hardworking shoulder area, the flat iron steak is known to be impressively tender. The reason for this is due to its location in the cow. Despite being in the shoulder, it resides in a spot that does not bear much weight nor does it get heavily exercised. It is this position on the cow that helps to preserve the flat iron steak's tenderness. However, it is worth mentioning that this tender piece of meat remained largely ignored for a long time because it is traversed by an extremely tough piece of connective tissue. This connective tissue is so tough it rendered this cut nearly inedible. Its culinary potential was only realized when researchers at the University of Nebraska and the University of Florida developed a new method of butchery to remove this piece of connective tissue in the 2000s. The researchers discovered that if the shoulder cut was split along the connective tissue, they could remove it and create two pieces of steak. The distinct shape of the flat iron steak is what gave it its name. Once the connective tissue is removed, the remaining piece of meat is a uniform, rectangular shape that closely resembles an antique flat iron.  Since then, its popularity has increased rapidly. Butchers and chefs widely appreciate its flavorsome and tender characteristics, and the affordability compared to other premium cuts makes the flat iron cut a favorite among consumers as well. In conclusion, the flat iron cut of meat comes from the shoulder or chuck area of a cow. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its tenderness and rich flavor, which come as a result of its specific location within the cow and the specialized method of butchery developed to remove the challenging connective tissue running through it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.  - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution.  - Klinik, (sometimes called The Klinik), is an industrial music band from Belgium, originally formed around 1982 by electro-synthpop practitioner Marc Verhaeghen, who is the only constant member.  - Dive is a Belgian electronic dance music project formed in 1990 by Dirk Ivens ( Absolute Body Control , Klinik , Blok 57 , Sonar ) . Dive 's \`\` audio trademark '' is the experimental sound of abused drum machines , pulsating through crackling distortion on almost every song .  - Live PA (meaning Live Public Address, or Live Personal Appearance) is the act of performing live electronic music in settings typically associated with DJing, such as nightclubs, raves, and more recently dance music festivals.  - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\".  - A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue and bar which serves alcoholic beverages that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'.   - Dirk Ivens is a Belgian musician and performer in the industrial music genre.   - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.  - A rave (from the verb: \\"to rave\\") is a large dance party featuring performances by DJs and occasionally live performers playing electronic music, particularly electronic dance music (EDM). The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is accompanied by laser light shows, projected images, visual effects and fog machines. The word \\"rave\\" was first used in the late 1980s to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair?, using the article: Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three., what would be the answer ?

The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\"  Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given...

This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the Öffentlichkeit or public sphere. The concept of a public has also been defined in political science, psychology, marketing, and advertising. In public relations and communication science, it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field. Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, it has suffered in more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

The series had been a see-saw in victors, with the winning team alternating each time; the Bears won the most recent game in 2013 23-20, but the Ravens won the latest game in Baltimore (a 31-7 rout in 2009). For the Bears offense, the unit hoped to provide more support for Mitchell Trubisky in his first NFL away game. \\"The kid's going to be special and we've got to do our jobs around him; keep getting in the right spot, make plays and catch the football, and making sure we're keeping him out of first-and-17s,\\" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains stated. \\"We have a lot of faith and confidence in Mitchell.\\" To do this, USA Today's Lorin Cox wrote the offensive line needed to stop Ravens nose tackle Michael Pierce, whose 13 stops in 2017 tied for fifth among defensive linemen. On defense, the Bears entered the game with the sixth-ranked defense (allowing 305 yards per game) that also ranked ninth in average yards allowed per play (5.07). With Danny Trevathan returning from suspension, the defense faced a Ravens offense that ranked sixth in rushing with 130.4 yards per game. On the other hand, Baltimore's offensive line - particularly the guards - had been struggling due to injuries, and Cox wrote the defense should take advantage of the openings. While the Bears had yet to record an interception in 2017, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco had thrown 33 in his last 31 games, including one in ten consecutive games; Cox added, \\"It's up to this defense to actually finish the turnover.\\" The first five drives of the game ended with punts. The Bears opted for a run-based attack for much of the game; on their first scoring drive in the second quarter, all but one play was a run, with the series ending on Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal. On the Ravens' next drive, Maxx Williams was stripped by Christian Jones and Trevathan recovered the loose ball. Although the Bears were unable to capitalize on the takeaway, the defense recorded another turnover on the next drive when Bryce Callahan intercepted Flacco's pass intended for Breshad Perriman. On a halfback option, Tarik Cohen eventually threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller to put the Bears up 10-0. Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to put the Ravens on the scoreboard with three seconds remaining in the first half. During the third quarter, Trubisky led a 66-yard drive that ended with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Dion Sims. During the ensuing kickoff, Joshua Bellamy appeared to trip Ravens kick returner Bobby Rainey, but Rainey instead got back up and ran 96 yards for a touchdown. Upon review, the referees determined Bellamy's hand did not touch Rainey. Subsequently, the Bears committed two turnovers: Cohen fumbled at the Bears' 39-yard line - which set up Tucker's 31-yard field goal to narrow the gap to four points - and Trubisky was strip-sacked by Lardarius Webb with C. J. Mosley recovering. The Ravens reached the Bears' 30-yard line, where Flacco was intercepted by Adrian Amos, who returned his first career interception 90 yards for the touchdown to put the Bears up by 11 points with 5:08 left in the game. However, Tucker kicked a 50-yard field goal with 2:53 remaining, while Michael Campanaro scored on a 77-yard punt return touchdown and Flacco completed the two-point conversion to Nick Boyle to tie the game at 24 apiece and enter overtime. Neither team was able to score on their first drive; on Chicago's second series, the offense was pinned at its own seven-yard line. Jordan Howard recorded a 53-yard run on the first play of the possession, which was later followed by Trubisky's 18-yard pass to Kendall Wright on third down to draw the Bears closer. Barth kicked a 40-yard field goal to win the game. It was the Bears' first road victory since 2015 against the Buccaneers, breaking a ten-game losing streak. The Bears' rushing attack resulted in a career high 167 rushing yards on 36 carries for Howard, while Cohen had 14 carries for 32 yards. Trubisky threw just 16 passes, completing eight for 113 yards and a touchdown. John Fox explained the Ravens were the reason for the run-based strategy, having used the same philosophy with the 2012 Denver Broncos; in that team's game against Baltimore, the Broncos ran 44 times against just 21 passing plays despite the presence of Peyton Manning.","output":"Task: Create questions from the given passage that involve complex reasoning, including numerical reasoning.

Answer the following question: Given the fact that:  The closer the charged objects are, the stronger the electrostatic force.  Answer the question:   When two batteries are placed further apart, John can tell that the electrostatic force is more or less? Answer:","output":"When two batteries are placed further apart, John can tell that the electrostatic force between them is less.  To understand why, we must first comprehend what electrostatic force is. Electrostatic force is a type of physical force that electric charges exert on each other. It's explained by Coulomb's Law, which states that the force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  Batteries, in particular, operate on electrical charge. The negative terminal has an abundance of electrons, which are negatively charged, and the positive terminal lacks electrons, giving it a positive charge. When two batteries are placed close to each other, the positive terminal of one battery will naturally attract the negatively charged electrons from the negative terminal of the other battery. This is the basic principle behind electrostatic force. Now, when the distance between these batteries is increased, the electrostatic force between them decreases. This is because the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two batteries. So essentially if the distance is doubled, the force will decrease to one fourth of its original value. Therefore, considering this, if John were to place two batteries further apart, he would notice that the electrostatic force between them decreases or in other words, it becomes less. This would make it harder for electricity to flow because there would be more resistance against the electrons trying to move between the batteries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph does indicate that the four multinational companies have gained access to large potential new markets in Eastern Europe and the Far East due to political changes and the removal of trade barriers. However, it does not directly mention the preference or likeness of Eastern Europeans for foreign cigarettes. Access to new markets does not necessarily translate into immediate preference or popularity among the consumers. It is important to consider other factors that could influence the popularity of foreign cigarettes in Eastern Europe. For example, the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, the availability of local cigarette brands, consumer preferences, cultural differences, and pricing. Without more information on these factors and the actual sales performance of the foreign cigarettes in the Eastern European market, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the preference or likeness of Eastern Europeans for these foreign cigarettes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Q:Information:  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Guatemala is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The capital is Guatemala City, which also serves as the national capital.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent.  - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize. Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea.  - The Darién Gap is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama's Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department in South America. The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway.  - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse.  - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately , called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to \\"Guinness World Records\\", the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \\"motorable road\\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - Huehuetenango is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It is situated in the western highlands and shares borders with Mexico in the north and west; with El Quiché in the east, with Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos to the south. The capital is the city of Huehuetenango.  - Guatemala City, locally known as Guatemala or Guate, is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Guatemala, and the most populous in Central America. The city is located in the south-central part of the country, nestled in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita. In 2009, it had a population of 1,075,000. Guatemala City is also the capital of the local Municipality of Guatemala and of the Guatemala Department.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people.  - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).  - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.  - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic.  - Huehuetenango is a city and a municipality in the highlands of western Guatemala .

Select the topic that this about: Palestinian officials on Sunday accused the United States of harming prospects for Mideast peace after the latest indications that Washington is ready to accept some Israeli expansion of West Bank settlements. Available options: [+] World; [+] Sports; [+] Business; [+] Science/Tech;","output":"[+] World The latest accusations made by Palestinian officials against the United States over its acceptance of some Israeli expansion of West Bank settlements have the potential to impact prospects for peace in the Middle East. This issue falls under the category of world affairs, primarily as it involves multiple nations and their relations, as well as global peace efforts. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has had a significant effect on the Middle East, with multiple attempts from different countries and international organizations to negotiate or impose a viable peace solution. The United States has long been involved in the efforts to resolve the conflict, often acting as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. However, its policy on the Israeli settlements in the West Bank has shifted across various administrations. This latest move by the United States to seemingly accept some form of Israeli expansion in the West Bank contravenes the international consensus on this matter. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, as they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into the territory it occupies. The expansion of these settlements has been viewed as a hindrance to peace, as it continues to encroach upon Palestinian lands and diminishes the prospects of creating a contiguous and viable Palestinian state. Palestinian officials have argued that acceptance of Israeli settlement expansion by the United States sends the wrong message to Israel, as it emboldens further incursions and devalues the Palestinian claims to a future state. This stance from the United States may lead to increased tensions within the region, further complicating an already complex situation and undermining international efforts towards peace. Furthermore, this issue has ramifications beyond the immediate actors involved. Regional stability and the security of the wider Middle East are jeopardized by a lack of progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Countries such as Iran and Turkey have interests and influence within the region, and tensions between Israel and the Palestinians can exacerbate existing issues or create new geopolitical challenges. As such, the recent accusations made by Palestinian officials regarding the United States’ position on Israeli settlements should be considered an important development in world affairs. Acceptance of Israeli settlement expansion by the United States has implications not only for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also for regional stability, international peace efforts, and the overall geopolitical landscape of the Middle East."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: Who spies on the aviation tycoon's daughter? is inside the article: Mike Regan is a self-made aviation tycoon who lives in a state-of-the-art smart house full of modern technology with his wife Rose and 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn. Mike's company is developing an app called \\"Omni Jet\\" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed financial capital with a stock offering. However, it requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old information technology consultant and calls him to fix his home's Wi-Fi signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the Global Positioning System in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the National Security Agency and had taken part in a military exercise in Kandahar. Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the house. He also spies on Kaitlyn and secretly records her masturbating in the shower. Porter sends fake emails to Mike's clients and the SEC, threatening the company's survival. He also takes full control of the house's technology, which leaves the family terrified. He uses a spoof email to send Rose fake mammogram results, saying that she tested positive for breast cancer.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: For each row in musical table, find the corresponding rows in actor table. Step 2: find Nominee of the results of step 1 whose Award equals Tony Award or actor's Name equals Cleavant Derricks Output:","output":"Based on the given steps, we can create the following SQL statement: SELECT actor.Nominee FROM musical JOIN actor ON musical.id = actor.musical_id WHERE actor.Award = 'Tony Award' OR actor.Name = 'Cleavant Derricks';"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Surround yourself with mature people. Learn new things every day. Accept constructive criticism. Take responsibility for your actions. Improve your communication skills.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Path to Personal Growth: How Maturity, Learning, and Accountability Lead to a Better You Introduction Personal growth and self-improvement are lifelong journeys that encompass emotional, intellectual, and social development. One of the critical elements to achieve this is to surround yourself with mature individuals who share the same growth mindset and possess qualities that foster learning, acceptance, responsibility, and effective communication. In this article, we will look at how each aspect contributes to your journey and aids in developing a stronger sense of self and emotional well-being. 1. Surround Yourself with Mature People The company you keep has a significant impact on your thinking, habits, and overall outlook on life. Mature people approach situations with wisdom, understanding, and a genuine desire for personal growth. They possess emotional intelligence and are always striving for self-improvement. By surrounding yourself with a mature and supportive group, you will reap the benefits of their positive influence. They can provide valuable insights, challenge your assumptions, and encourage you to strive for improvement. Their guidance and support can be invaluable assets in helping you navigate the ups and downs of life while staying focused on your objectives. 2. Learn New Things Every Day Curiosity and the act of continuous learning are essential ingredients for growth. Embrace lifelong learning to develop a richer understanding of the world around you, enhance your skills, and cultivate a mindset of growth and adaptability. Learning can be achieved through various avenues, including reading, attending courses and workshops, engaging in new hobbies, having thought-provoking conversations with others, and even through travel and exposure to different cultures and ideas. The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know, which fuels your desire for further knowledge and growth. 3. Accept Constructive Criticism Feedback and constructive criticism are vital for personal growth. While it can be uncomfortable to hear critiques of one's actions and ideas, embracing them with an open mind allows for a deeper understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Mature individuals view criticism as an opportunity to learn, improve, and ultimately become better versions of themselves. When facing criticism, actively listen and hold back the urge to defend immediately. Give yourself time to reflect on the feedback and assess whether it adds value to your growth. If it does, incorporate it into your self-improvement plan and use it to fuel your progress. 4. Take Responsibility for Your Actions Personal growth and accountability go hand in hand. When you take responsibility for your actions, you acknowledge the role you play in shaping your life's outcomes, both positive and negative. This understanding empowers you to make necessary changes, to apologize when necessary, and to learn from your mistakes. Taking responsibility also means recognizing and understanding your emotions and how they contribute to your reactions. When you acknowledge the role emotions play in your life, you can develop better coping mechanisms and management strategies. 5. Improve Your Communication Skills Effective communication is a skill that, when mastered, can lead to better relationships, higher levels of understanding, and more efficient problem-solving. Improving this skill is an investment in both your professional and personal life. To enhance your communication skills, focus on aspects such as active listening, empathy, assertiveness, and body language. Engaging in activities such as public speaking, writing, and even improvisational acting can also contribute to this crucial skill. Conclusion In our pursuit of self-improvement, we should aim to surround ourselves with mature individuals, continually expand our knowledge and skills, welcome constructive criticism, take responsibility for our actions, and polish our communication skills. By incorporating these elements into our personal growth journey, we will inevitably emerge as better, more well-rounded individuals ready to thrive in all aspects of life."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

His research reveals that the town's population has remained at exactly 436 for over 100 years.

He also befriends Amanda (Reva Timbers), a young girl whose father was killed trying to escape the town, and who is being held at Dr Greaver (David Fox)'s clinic, on the pretext of treating her for schizophrenia. Courtney and Amanda both express a desire to leave the town, but are afraid of the consequences of trying.After stumbling upon some books on Biblical numerology, Kady realises that the townspeople attach a mystical importance to the number 436 and are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the population at exactly that number, including executing surplus residents.

Ms Summerfield, who also runs a veterinary practice, said the service was not means tested and would \\"rely on people's honesty\\". All they need to show is a utility bill with an address to access the service. \\"This is the first one I'm aware of in the country,\\" she said. \\"I'm hoping that other areas eventually will have little branches like ours in other communities. \\"If you ring any rescue centre they're getting at least four or five calls a day from people saying 'I'm having to rehome my pet because I can't afford to feed it'. \\"Some might say, if they can't afford to feed it then should they have a pet? But if you've had a pet for years but have had your [work] hours dropped or lost your job or your home, what are you meant to do?\\" Donation points will be set up in Tesco and Dudley & Friends pet shop in Prestatyn. The project will also recruit volunteers to help sort donations and deliver packages to people who are unable to visit the pet food bank in person. Summary:","output":"Marjorie Summerfield, who runs The Pet Rescue Welfare Association, has established a pet food bank in Dyserth due to rising numbers of people unable to feed their pets, which she attributes to austerity measures; the service is open to all without means testing, aiming to prevent pets needing to be rehomed due to financial difficulties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage. Even though I was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days, I can't predict which way the court will come down. But the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization. Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. DOMA passed in 1996 with 78% of the U.S. House and 85% of the Senate and was signed by President Bill Clinton. When her partner died in 2009,","output":"Edith Windsor was faced with a hefty estate tax bill because, under DOMA, her marriage to a woman was not recognized by the federal government. If her spouse had been a man, she would have qualified for the marital tax deduction and avoided the exorbitant tax. Windsor sued the federal government, arguing that the unequal treatment of her marriage for tax purposes violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Both Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor were monumental cases in the fight for marriage equality in the United States, but it was ultimately another case, 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges, that established the right to same-sex marriage nationwide. However, the outcomes of these cases significantly influenced the broader conversation on same-sex marriage rights and laid the groundwork for the landmark decision in Obergefell. As for DOMA, it was largely ruled unconstitutional in the Windsor case, allowing married same-sex couples to receive federal benefits. In conclusion, while it was impossible to predict the outcome of Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor at the time, these cases played a critical role in the advancement of marriage equality in the United States. Their outcomes ranged from leaving existing laws unchanged to necessitating significant shifts in the legal framework surrounding marriage, ultimately contributing to the recognition and protection of same-sex marriages under the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nonetheless, fresh turmeric can often be found at farmers' markets, larger grocery stores, health food stores, and asian markets.","output":"Step 1: Gather ingredients and supplies - Choose your turmeric, as stated in the given information. - Purchase or gather additional ingredients, such as black pepper, ginger, honey, lemon, and cinnamon (depending on personal preference for taste). - Gather any necessary supplies, such as a kettle or saucepan, teapot, mugs, spoon, or strainer. Step 2: Prepare the ingredients - For fresh turmeric, peel the skin and grate the desired amount. - For ground turmeric, measure out the desired amount. - Prepare any additional ingredients, such as slicing the ginger or lemon. - Justification: Preparing ingredients beforehand will make the process easier and smoother. Step 3: Boil water - Fill a kettle or saucepan with the desired amount of water (depending on the number of servings) and bring it to a boil. - Justification: Boiling water is necessary for the tea-making process, as it helps to extract the flavors and benefits of the ingredients.

Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men.

Options: - ditch - terrarium - thick forest - kew gardens - feild  The answer is \\"kew gardens\\" because A:","output":"Kew Gardens, also known as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is an excellent hiding place for a snake in the United Kingdom. The sprawling landscape, extensive horticultural collections, and varied microhabitats within the gardens make it a perfect environment for snakes to thrive, hide, and find plenty of food options. While there are potential hiding spots in ditches, terrariums, thick forests, and fields, Kew Gardens offers a more ideal environment for a snake due to the following reasons: 1. Biodiversity: Kew Gardens is home to a variety of flora and fauna, creating a thriving ecosystem with a rich biodiversity. This abundance of plant life provides a multitude of places for a snake to hide without being easily detected. Moreover, the diverse presence of insects, amphibians, and small mammals makes it a prime location for finding food. 2. Microhabitats: The garden is divided into various sections, such as the arboretum, glasshouses, woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands. These different habitats provide appropriate environments for different snake species, catering to their individual needs and preferences. 3. Shelter: Kew Gardens features numerous natural and manmade hiding spots for snakes. The landscapes include rock gardens, fallen tree branches, dense foliage, and carefully managed woodland areas with heaps of dead leaves and other organic debris, giving snakes ample opportunities for shelter and camouflage. 4. Climate Control: The glasshouses in Kew Gardens maintain controlled climates tailored to the needs of particular plants and animals. These structures can offer suitable temperatures and humidity levels to accommodate snakes that would prefer warmer or more tropical environments, allowing them to find a comfortable hiding place, which is not possible in an open field or a typical dense forest in the United Kingdom. 5. Conservation Efforts: Kew Gardens is an internationally renowned center for the study and conservation of plants and fungi, as well as the wildlife that interacts with them. By residing in such an environment, a snake can potentially benefit from these ongoing research and conservation measures, resulting in minimal human disturbance and a more sustainable habitat for the snake. In conclusion, Kew Gardens provides an exceptional hiding place for a snake within the United Kingdom due to its extensive biodiversity, multiple microhabitats, ample sources of shelter, controlled climates, and ongoing conservation efforts. While the other options may offer suitable hiding places in certain situations, Kew Gardens offers a more comprehensive and diverse environment that caters to the needs of various snake species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Endorphins also help counteract the prostaglandins in your body that cause contractions and pain. Because of this, physical activity may help relieve cramps. Try different kinds of aerobic exercise, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, kayaking, hiking, or a class at the gym. Stretching helps relax your muscles and alleviate cramps. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched far apart. Stretch forward to catch your toes or ankle. Breathe in while keeping your back straight. After a few breaths, lean forward towards the floor. You can try other simple stretches as well to stretch out your back or abdomen, depending on which areas hurt the most. Some women experience relief from menstrual cramping with orgasm. The reason behind this is not well understood, but may have something to do with endorphins released during sexual arousal. Much like with exercise, the endorphins released during orgasm can help relieve the menstrual cramps and inflammation. Similar to aerobic exercise and stretching, yoga helps relax the body and reduce aches and pains in the lower back, legs, and abdomen. When you begin to feel menstrual cramps, you can try various yoga poses to help you with your pain. Before you start, get in some comfortable clothes and put on soothing music.  You can do the head-to-knee forward bend. Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Pull one of your legs in and bend it 90 degrees so that the sole of your foot rests against the inside of your thigh. Inhale and grab your shin, ankle, or foot. Stretch the torso over your leg towards the foot. Exhale and bend down from the groin. Lengthen and stretch your back instead of rounding it. Breathe as you hold the pose, extending through the heel and pressing your sitting bones towards the floor. Hold for 1-3 minutes, then switch sides. You can also try the noose pose. Get into a full squat with your feet together. Lower down until your buttocks are towards your heels. Inhale, then move your knees to the left as you turn your torso to the right.

Choices:  a). yes;  b). no;","output":"a) Yes; The famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers is the Mayflower. The Mayflower was an English ship that transported a group of English families known today as the Pilgrim Fathers or Pilgrims from England to the New World in 1620. The Pilgrims were religious dissenters seeking to establish a new life in the New World, free of religious persecution from the English monarchy and the Church of England. The Pilgrims initially planned their voyage on two ships: the Mayflower and the Speedwell. However, the Speedwell faced numerous issues and was deemed unseaworthy, causing all passengers to be consolidated onto the Mayflower. The journey took around 66 days, and the 102 passengers, accompanied by 30 crew members, faced a challenging and treacherous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. They finally reached the shores of present-day Massachusetts, North America, where they founded Plymouth Colony. The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by 41 of the male passengers, became a valuable and historical document. It served as a basis for the colony's early self-governance, creating a foundation for later democratic principles and the establishment of the United States of America. The story of the Pilgrims' journey on the Mayflower has become a significant and celebrated event in American history. Annually, the United States celebrates Thanksgiving Day in commemoration of the Pilgrims' harvest feast held in the autumn of 1621, attended by Native Americans, who provided significant help and support to the settlers, especially in the form of agricultural knowledge. The Pilgrims' journey has subsequently become a symbol of human resilience, courage, and determination in the face of considerable adversity. Moreover, the voyage of the Mayflower from Southampton's port ultimately transformed North America and laid the foundations for future European settlement and the eventual birth of the United States of America."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Contemporary biographers have turned Lewis Carroll (pictured in later life) into a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls. Lewis Carroll has been cast by many modern biographers as a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls that led him to take hundreds of nude photographs of them. But a leading authority on the author has now claimed this is a ‘myth’ created by spurious and sloppy research. Edward Wakeling has criticised biographers who have given the author of two of literature’s greatest children’s classics - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass - a disturbing modern reputation. Previously-unpublished letters and reminiscences of those who knew him are among thousands of documents which Mr Wakeling has collected over four decades. They offer evidence that Carroll was in fact a sociable man who enjoyed adult company as much as children’s, he said, adding: ‘It’s both. You can’t just say it’s one and not the other.’ From an opus of some 3,000 photographs, Mr Wakeling has calculated that nude photographs of children represent ‘no more than 1 per cent of Carroll’s output’. While Katie Roiphe wrote a novel portraying Carroll as holding sexual feelings towards his muse, biographer Morton N Cohen observed that it would be ‘naïve’ to suggest that Carroll’s interest in children was ‘strictly artistic’. But Mr Wakeling points to unpublished material, including reminiscences of Mabel Amy Burton, who was eight when she met Carroll in 1877. She recalled: ‘As a small child I much disliked strangers, but the personality of this gentleman attracted me and I chatted away with him quite freely.’ Young girl: Alice Liddell (pictured) was photographed many times by Carroll. Pictured above in 1858, she was the daughter of family friend Henry George Liddell and the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland. On news of his death, she wrote of the ‘irreparable loss in the hearts of many who had been his child-friends’. Mr Wakeling says: ‘It is about time we cleared up, once and for all, the pervading false myth about [Carroll’s] unhealthy relationship with children. He was a lover of children but he was not an abuser of children.’ He added: ‘There must be 30 or 40 biographies since his nephew wrote the first one in 1898. ‘People who decide to write about Carroll realise that they’re not going to get their book published unless they can find a new angle. ‘Quite a few of them have scratched their head and come up with something outrageous and controversial like Lewis Carroll was Jack the Ripper, that he didn’t write Alice - Queen Victoria did - that he was having a sexual affair with Alice’s mother, and a lot more nonsense…. ‘Then there are biographers who really don’t do their homework. They read a few other biographies, regurgitate them, add a few bits of speculation - and that’s it.’ Also pictured by Carroll: Gertrude Chataway, photographed (above) in 1876, was one of the author's closest friends. The girl inspired his nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark. Then, he suggests, like Chinese whispers, untrue facts get shared and embellished. He argues that, if biographers went back to the primary sources, they would discover a very different picture of Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll (above) needed to explore children, a leading authority says. Mr Wakeling is a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, who regularly advises auctioneers and exhibitions worldwide. His books include Carroll’s ten-volume Diaries, which he edited in 2007 following their release by the family. He also owns one of the finest Carrollian collections, including a database of 6,000 letters, of which some 4,000 are unpublished: ‘So there’s a great wealth of material I can draw on.’ He publishes his research later this month in a new book titled Lewis Carroll: The Man and His Circle. Numerous ‘myths’ that he challenges include those relating to Carroll’s photography, of which perhaps the most prevalent – ‘frequently used by writers, biographers and journalists’ – is the supposed large body of studies of nude children: ‘This is not borne out by the facts.’ He argues that picturing nude children and focussing his camera on girls was common practice among Victorian photographers and that, when Carroll visited family friends, boys were more likely to be away at school. Vilifying a man who believed in girls’ education is therefore unjustified. Anyway, there are as well many photographs of boys and adults. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll needed to explore children, Mr Wakeling pointed out: ‘His relationship with children is not an all-encompassing part of his life, which many of the biographers tried to suggest. ‘He was a teacher. He actually enjoyed the intellectual banter that he could have with children. Children in Victorian times found that very refreshing because it was very uncommon for someone to treat them as equals. Children were seen and not heard.’ Photographed: Carroll also took portraits of poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1857 (left) and Prince Leopold, the eighth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1875 (right) For Carroll, Mr Wakeling added, ‘they were seen and heard’. Reviewing reminiscences by Carroll’s child-friends, Mr Wakeling could not find ‘a bad word spoken against him’. Those friends included Edith Litton, who described Carroll as ‘one of my most delightful friends’ with a ‘sweet smile’. She was seven when he read her the story of Hans Andersen’s Ugly Duckling: ‘Being very sensitive about my ugly little self, it greatly interested me.’ He told her that ‘it was better to be good, truthful’. Mr Wakeling ridicules Carroll’s portrayal as an eccentric misfit: ‘The vast majority of the biographers say he was a shy, reclusive man. Nonsense. He was a socialite. ‘He mixed with the great and the good of Victorian society - all the Pre-Raphaelites, Arthur Sullivan [the composer], famous politicians. ‘He was a friend of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, whose parties he was often invited to. This man is not a recluse and he isn’t shy.’ His evidence includes an unpublished letter from Lady Georgina Salisbury, telling Carroll: ‘The children are very anxious you should come to their party… and, if you could come on the 31st and stay over the 3rd January, we should be delighted to see you.’ His circle of friends included Sir James Paget, surgeon to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. In response to Carroll’s concern for a friend who was dying from cancer, Paget wrote: ‘I will gladly see the poor lady.’ ‘Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it,’ thought Carroll, and in Mr Wakeling’s book it is clear: to defend him from his modern character assassins. The book is published ahead of next year’s celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice, and include a major BBC documentary, books and exhibitions worldwide. But no doubt those with suspicious minds will be back.

Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Besides making them stronger, why is taking HGH attractive for some athletes?

A pantry is a room, closet, or designated area where food, beverages, and sometimes kitchenware and tableware are stored. The primary purpose of a pantry is to keep food items well-organized, easily accessible, and safe from any potential contaminants. - Bottom floor: Food is generally not stored on the floor in a pantry because it is less organized, can lead to contamination or pests, and is harder to access. - Shop: A shop refers to a retail establishment, which does not relate to the storage of food in a pantry.  - Kitchen: Although a kitchen is where food is stored and prepared, it is not a specific location within the pantry for food storage. - Shelf: A shelf serves as the primary storage space in a pantry as it provides an organized, easily accessible, and visible method for storing food items. Shelves can be either built-in, attached to the wall, or part of a freestanding unit. Foods can be sorted on shelves according to category, size, or desired organization. - Refrigerators: While refrigerators are essential for preserving perishable items, they are not relevant to storing non-perishable food in a pantry.

Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. Question: In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\" you should practice how to   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"fall safely\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"fall safely.\\" In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\", which is Step 3, you should practice how to fall safely on your skates. It is important to know how to fall properly to minimize injuries and build confidence while skating. By practicing falling and getting back up, you become less afraid of potential falls and can focus on improving your skating skills and finding your balance.

Ellsworth-vuoret Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The phrase \\"Ellsworth-vuoret\\" is Finnish and translates to \\"Ellsworth Mountains\\" in English. The Ellsworth Mountains are a mountain range in Antarctica, named after American explorer, aviator, and polar adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth. The Ellsworth Mountains are the highest range in Antarctica, extending about 350 kilometers (220 miles) inland and reaching an elevation of 4,898 meters (16,076 feet) at Mount Vinson, which is the highest peak on the continent. The mountains are significant not only for their size but also for their geological features, which provide valuable information for scientific research. The range is separated into two main parts: the Sentinel Range in the north and the Heritage Range in the south. The Sentinel Range is more massive and contains some of the highest peaks in Antarctica, while the Heritage Range is lower and more accessible. Both ranges are characterized by a diverse array of majestic peaks, glaciers, icefalls, and valleys. The remote and harsh environment of the Ellsworth Mountains makes them difficult to access and explore. Over the years, various scientific missions have attempted to study and map out the range, with the purpose of understanding the geology, climate, and history of the region. Since the mountains are located within the boundaries of the Antarctic Treaty, they are protected and managed under this international agreement. The treaty aims to preserve the Antarctic environment and its unique ecosystems, promote scientific cooperation, and ensure the peaceful and non-military use of the continent. In summary, the Ellsworth Mountains, known as \\"Ellsworth-vuoret\\" in Finnish, are an important and impressive mountain range in Antarctica. They offer significant opportunities for scientific research, geological exploration, and understanding the history and evolution of our planet. At the same time, the Ellsworth Mountains serve as a symbol of international cooperation and environmental conservation through their inclusion in the Antarctic Treaty system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

Help as much as you can. Question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Paragraph: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener didn't increase predator population? Answer:","output":"Kat did not increase predator population, as she applied conventional gardening methods."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\",  answer the following question.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly explain how sedimentary rocks form.  Sedimentary rocks form through a step-by-step process: 1. Weathering and erosion: Rocks on Earth's surface are exposed to weathering, which breaks them down into smaller particles called sediments. Erosion then transports these sediments to new locations. 2. Deposition: The sediments are eventually deposited through processes like settling in calm water, accumulation on floodplains, or as windblown deposits. 3. Lithification: Over time, the layers of deposited sediment accumulate and become compressed under the weight of overlying layers. The pressure from this buildup, combined with chemical reactions from groundwater and minerals, causes the sediments to bind together and harden into solid rock. 4. Compaction and cementation: The final stages of sedimentary rock formation involve further compaction of the sediments and cementation, where minerals like silica or calcite fill in the spaces between sediment particles, \\"gluing\\" them together. These processes result in the formation of sedimentary rocks, which constitute a significant portion of Earth's crust and can provide valuable information about Earth's history and the environments in which they were formed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This includes people born in the UK who are of Indian descent, and Indian-born people who have migrated to the UK. Today, Indians comprise about 1.4 million people in the UK (not including those of mixed Indian and other ancestry), making them the single largest visible ethnic minority population in the country. They make up the largest subgroup of British Asians, and are one of the largest Indian communities in the Indian diaspora, mainly due to the Indian-British relations (including historical links such as India having been under British colonial rule and still being part of the Commonwealth of Nations). The British Indian community is the sixth largest in the Indian diaspora, behind the Indian communities in the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Nepal. The largest group of British Indians are those of Punjabi origin, accounting for an estimated 45 percent of the British Indian population (based on data for England and Wales), with smaller groups including Gujarati and Malayali communities.  - The IBSF World Billiards Championship (previously known as the World Amateur Billiards Championship) is the premier, international, non-professional tournament for the game of English billiards.

Firstly, the reviewer uses highly positive adjectives to describe both the film and the performance of the actress Barbara Stanwyck. The words such as \\"appealing,\\" \\"great,\\" \\"wonderful,\\" \\"amazing,\\" \\"sexy,\\" and \\"excellent,\\" all indicate a high level of satisfaction. The reviewer also expresses love for happy endings, showing approval for the narrative direction, despite mentioning that it may have been \\"tacked on.\\" Secondly, there is distinctive admiration for Barbara Stanwyck’s character. The reviewer points out that she knows what she wants and admirably goes after it. This character intrigue indicates the reviewer's appreciation for character development in the film and believable acting. We also can see the reviewer's neutral to mildly positive sentiment towards the film’s ending. Despite calling it \\"perhaps tacked-on,\\" which implies a mild critique, the reviewer immediately mitigates the potential negativity by affirming their love for \\"happy endings\\". Therefore, the provided critique does not significantly detract from the overall positive sentiment. In sum, the minor criticisms do not overpower the glowing commendation, thus the sentiment conveyed is largely positive.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power.  Which country used more coal?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The answer to this question is:","output":"Turkey used more coal in producing their electricity as they primarily relied on fossil fuels, while Greece utilized nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, generate electricity upon combustion, releasing greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the environment. Coal, in particular, is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to global warming and air pollution. As mentioned in the hint, these environmental effects are detrimental to living organisms and ecosystem health. On the other hand, Greece chose a different method for electricity production: nuclear power. Nuclear energy comes from the splitting of uranium atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This process releases energy in the form of heat, which then generates steam that spins turbines and creates electricity. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases or any direct air pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Although nuclear energy presents its own set of challenges, including the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, its environmental impacts are dramatically less concerning than those caused by the combustion of coal. In conclusion, Turkey, which relied on fossil fuels to generate electricity, consequently used more coal than Greece that opted for nuclear power as their primary energy source. Although both fossil fuels and radioactive elements are nonrenewable resources, the environmental consequences associated with coal usage make it a less sustainable choice for electricity generation in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: what is the meaning of quaid e azam?","output":"Quaid-e-Azam is a title in Urdu that is given to an individual who holds great importance and is highly regarded in a society or nation. The term \\"Quaid-e-Azam\\" can be translated to \\"Great Leader\\" or \\"Supreme Leader\\" in English. This title is most famously associated with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in Karachi on December 25, 1876, and received his early education from the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam in Karachi, and later the Christian Missionary Society High School. He then proceeded to England to pursue higher education from the Lincoln's Inn. Throughout his life, he practiced law, was a renowned political leader, and played a crucial role in the creation of Pakistan. Therefore, due to his immense contribution, he was given the title of \\"Quaid-e-Azam.\\" Jinnah first entered politics in 1906 when he joined the Indian National Congress. However, during his time in Congress, Jinnah grew disenchanted with the Hindu-majority organization, primarily due to its lack of consideration for Indian Muslims' rights and representation. Consequently, Jinnah joined the All India Muslim League in 1913, where he actively began working to protect Muslims' rights and the demand for separate electorates for both Hindus and Muslims. By the 1940s, it had become increasingly clear that Hindus and Muslims could not coexist harmoniously in a unified India. Jinnah was a strong advocate for the creation of a separate Muslim-majority nation and gave the idea of \\"two-nation theory.\\" This theory asserted that Muslims and Hindus were two separate nations and could not be assimilated into a single country. According to Jinnah, only a separate country would allow Muslims to reside and practice their religion and customs without any hindrance. Quaid-e-Azam's tireless efforts and astute leadership eventually led to the successful creation of the new Muslim-majority country of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Under his guidance, Pakistan managed to secure independence from British rule, free from political subjugation, cultural domination, economic exploitation, and social injustice that Indian Muslims had previously experienced. In summary, the meaning of \\"Quaid-e-Azam\\" is primarily associated with Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It denotes a title of utmost respect and admiration for the great leader who played a pivotal role in securing a safe homeland for India's Muslim population. Jinnah's unwavering determination and his charismatic leadership forged a nation, and his legacy lives on as the guiding spirit of Pakistan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: OGHuXKJodoDxBTmcIkPnJDHQu, SjCyoDxBTmcIkPOYl Student:","output":"To solve this problem, I used the definition of the longest common substring. A common substring is a sequence of characters that appear in the same order in both strings. The longest common substring is the one with the most characters. To find the longest common substring, I first divided the problem into smaller subproblems, comparing individual characters in both strings. I created a matrix of size (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1), initializing all elements to 0. This matrix will store the length of common substrings ending at each character in A (rows) and B (columns). Now, I looped through the strings A and B, represented by i and j respectively. If the characters A[i] and B[j] match, then I updated the value at matrix[i+1][j+1] by adding 1 to the value at matrix[i][j]. This means that the common substring extends by 1 character. As I progress through the matrix, I keep track of the maximum length of common substring found so far, and its ending position in string A. After finishing the iteration, I know the maximum length of the longest common substring and its ending position, so I can extract it from string A.

What Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons recorded by the medieval scribe Geoffrey of Monmouth included a character  considered a villain, obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father? Answer:","output":"The Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons, as recorded by medieval scribe Geoffrey of Monmouth, is \\"King Lear.\\" This renowned tragic play was written by William Shakespeare between 1605 and 1606, and it revolves around the story of an aging King of Britain, King Lear, who decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters based on their expressions of love for him. The character in question, considered a villain and obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father, is Regan. Regan is the second daughter of King Lear, and alongside her sister Goneril, she demonstrates her evil and cunning nature throughout the play. Initially, Regan flatters her father with eloquent declarations of her love and devotion to gain a larger portion of his kingdom. However, her actions soon reveal her true intentions and insincerity. As the story unfolds, Regan's hunger for power becomes more apparent. She plots against her father, treating him with extreme cruelty and disregard after Lear has divided his kingdom. Regan aims to usurp him completely by forcing him to give up his retinue, humiliating him, and ultimately leaving him vulnerable and powerless. This underhanded behavior is often paired with her older sister, Goneril, forming a formidable alliance driven by their shared ambition for power. Regan's ruthlessness extends not only to her father but also to others around her, including her own husband, the Duke of Cornwall, and her suitor, Edmund—the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester. Throughout the play, she vies for Edmund's affections with her sister Goneril, which eventually leads to their mutual demise. In the plot's climax, Regan is poisoned by her sister Goneril, who is driven by jealousy in their competition for Edmund's affection. The revelation of their treachery against their father and one another ultimately contributes to the tragic outcome of the play. In conclusion, \\"King Lear\\" is the Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Regan, one of King Lear's daughters, is the character considered a villain in the play. She is driven by a relentless pursuit of power, resulting in the cruel and merciless treatment of her aging father and others around her. Regan's villainous nature serves to heighten the drama and tragedy in this classic work by Shakespeare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[-] positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful","output":"The given phrase can be considered negative for several reasons. Here is a detailed analysis of the negative aspects present in the phrase: 1. \\"look down on\\": The phrase ‘look down on’ conveys a sense of superiority, as if the filmmakers are judging their working-class subjects in a condescending manner. This negative viewpoint fosters the idea that the filmmakers have a feeling of being above their subjects, which can make this phrase appear derogatory and unsympathetic. 2. \\"from their lofty perch\\": The use of the words \\"lofty perch\\" denotes a sense of detachment and distance between the filmmakers and their working-class subjects, which can further contribute to the negative perception of their relationship. This sense of separation can be interpreted as both physical (as in a higher position) and metaphorical (suggesting a difference in status or understanding). 3. \\"finally makes sex with strangers... so distasteful\\": The phrase \\"so distasteful\\" evokes a strong negative response. By stating that the film is \\"distasteful\\" it suggests that there is an unpleasant or morally disturbing aspect to it, which is not a positive qualification for any piece of art. 4. \\"opens today in the New York metropolitan area\\": Although this statement in isolation is neutral, it gains a negative connotation when paired with the previous negative comments about the film. Considering the overall negativity in the phrase, readers may interpret this as a negative event happening in the New York metropolitan area, as the film, labeled \\"distasteful,\\" will be accessible to the public there. In conclusion, the given phrase is considerably negative due to its portrayal of a condescending view by the filmmakers, the sense of detachment and superiority, and the strong distaste it evokes towards the subject matter. These negative aspects all contribute to creating an overall unfavorable impression of the film and its creators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]  There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.  Which village is situated closer to sea lever?

This move comes as a response to increasing scrutiny and pressure from various sources, including ongoing probes into the administration's activities as well as numerous civil lawsuits. Executive privilege is a legal doctrine which allows the president and other high-level executive branch officials to withhold information from Congress, the courts, and the public in order to protect the confidentiality of their communications and to ensure the proper functioning of the executive branch. This privilege is not absolute, and in some circumstances, can be overridden by a compelling need for information that is deemed necessary for the interests of justice.

Step 2: Explanation of executive privilege The text goes on to provide a general explanation of what executive privilege is and its purpose in protecting the president's communications. It also briefly mentions that this privilege is not absolute and can be overridden in certain situations. Step 3: Context behind the move The text will delve deeper into the reasons behind Clinton's legal team considering the option of invoking executive privilege. This includes detailing the ongoing probes, civil lawsuits, and other situations that have put pressure on the former president's administration. Step 4: Legal precedents and challenges The text will discuss the historical precedents for invoking executive privilege, citing examples of past administrations that have used this strategy to protect their communications, whether successfully or unsuccessfully. This will set the stage for a discussion on how Clinton's case might differ from others, and what specific challenges the legal team might face in using this approach. Step 5: Potential implications and outcomes Finally, the text will consider the possible outcomes of Clinton's legal team invoking executive privilege, including potential obstacles they might face in court, as well as the wider implications of this decision both for Clinton's administration and future administrations.

Photo: Freebase/Public domain      Known for: Acting in the late 1920s and early 1930s, known as \\"Hot Toddy.\\"      Thelma Todd was an actress in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She owned a café that she ran on the Roosevelt Highway (now called the Pacific Coast Highway), where she lived in the above apartment with her boyfriend at the time, Roland West. She was found dead inside a garage, behind the steering wheel of her car. At the time, some believed that she had committed suicide or accidentally killed herself while warming up her car when she got locked out of the house.      Todd had no signs of struggle on her, though she did have a broken nose. Her blood alcohol level was too high to have allowed her to climb the steps to the garage, and her sandals were too clean if she had, in fact, climbed the stairs herself.      A rumor spread that West confessed on his deathbed that he had unknowingly locked Todd in the garage. Todd's body was cremated, lending some to believe it was done to cover up her death by the corrupt District Attorney's office. Others suggest that it could have been her ex-husband or gang leader Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano who might have killed her, as she had had confrontations with both of them shortly before she died. ||||| Most knew her as Alicia Silverstone's chirpy, scene-stealing sidekick in \\"Clueless,\\" but Brittany Murphy stood at the brink of a promising Hollywood career that included a plum role in the Eminem film \\"8 Mile\\" and a public romance with her \\"Just Married\\" co-star Ashton Kutcher. But things spun out of control for Murphy, who was appearing increasingly more frail in her later years. On Dec. 20, 2009, the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at Murphy's home to find the 32-year-old actress unconscious. Murphy was pronounced dead on arrival at the Cedars-Sinai Medicinal Center after going into cardiac arrest. Though the primary cause of death was declared as pneumonia, many speculated that over-the-counter and prescription medications were to blame. Husband Simon Monjack died just five months later, also from pneumonia. There have been many conspiracy theories surrounding the two deaths, including mold and murder by government spies. The murder theory links to a wider terrorism conspiracy touted by Homeland Security whistleblower Julia Davis. In November 2013, a new lab report done at the request of the actress' father suggested that the actress may have been poisoned, however the Los Angeles County coroner has announced there are no plans to reopen the investigation into her death.      Thirty years following her death, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened the Natalie Wood case on Nov. 17, 2011, claiming officials received credible new information. The original investigation concluded that Wood, 43, accidentally drowned while yachting off the coast of California with husband Robert Wagner and their guest Christopher Walken. But the boat's captain Dennis Davern claims he heard the Oscar-nominated actress fighting on the deck with Wagner. Shortly thereafter, no one could locate Wood. Davern claims Wagner impeded their search for Wood by refusing to turn on lights or call for help. Wood's body was found the morning of Nov. 29, 1981 on Santa Catalina island, about a mile from the yacht.      Anna Nicole Smith, the rags-to-riches Playboy Playmate, was 26 years old when she married 89-year-old wheelchair-bound oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall. For years, she was a tabloid sensation and a realty TV star. After Marshall's death, a lengthy court battle over Marshall's inheritance proved more lurid, draining and outlandish than any Hollywood script, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in September 2010 -- not that Smith would live to see its outcome. On Sept. 7, 2006, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Smith gave birth to her daughter Dannielynn. Three days later, Smith's 20-year-old son Daniel Smith died in the same hospital, allegedly from a prescription drug overdose. Soon after, a distraught Smith married long-time friend and lawyer (and listed father on daughter Dannielynn's birth certificate) Howard K. Stern. Five months later, Smith was found dead in a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florido from a lethal \\"combined drug intoxication.\\"      Kurt Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 5, 1994, and though officially ruled a suicide there are those who believe he was murdered. Conspiracy theorists say he was murdered claiming that too much heroin in his system be able to function and turn a shotgun on himself, and point to the fact that there were no \\"legible\\" fingerprints on the gun, believing it may have been wiped clean.      Immortalized by friend P. Diddy's 2009 biopic, \\"Notorious,\\" Biggie Smalls, née Christopher George Latore Wallace, dominated a rapidly growing hip-hop scene in the early '90s and blew through the roof with hits like \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Big Poppa.\\" He also found himself at the center of an increasingly tense bi-coastal rivalry that pitted Tupac Shakur on the West Coast against Wallace, Sean Combs (later P. Diddy) and Uptown Records' founder Andrew Harrel on the East Coast. Wallace was shot in the chest four times early in the morning on March 9,1997, when a black Chevrolet Impala SS pulled up to Wallace's car in Los Angeles and its driver shot through the window. Wallace was pronounced dead a short while later at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; many consider his death an act of revenge for the mysterious killing of Shakur in 1996 . Wallace's murder case remains unsolved.      Silent film star Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle became one of the most famous men in America throughout the 1910s, starring in 37 films with everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. (He is credited with discovering Lloyd and Bob Hope, while also mentoring Chaplin.) In 1921, Arbuckle signed a then-record deal with Paramount worth 1 million. To celebrate, he threw a party over Labor Day at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. An actress named Virgina Rappe became ill at the party; she died four days later, and Arbuckle was accused of raping and accidentally killing her. Following three trials, Arbuckle was finally cleared of Rappe's death, but by then the damage had been done: his films were banned for short period of time, and he couldn't get work even after the ban lifted. Arbuckle returned in 1932 and later signed a contract with Warner Bros. to appear in feature-length comedies. \\"This is the best day of my life,\\" he was quoted as saying. Arbuckle died that night in his sleep after suffering a heart attack; he was 46. As for Rappe, she died from a ruptured bladder, which may have been caused from a botched abortion she had days before the Labor Day party.      On July 20, 1973, martial arts star Bruce Lee, 32, died as the result of an apparent allergic reaction to Equagesic, a painkiller. According to the coroner's report, Lee died \\"by misadventure.\\" He did suffer from seizures -- one happening just a month before his death -- but popular urban legends persist that Lee was murdered by triads, a curse on his family and/or the delayed reaction from Dim Mak strike (called the \\"Touch of Death\\").      While no one will dispute that bombshell Jayne Mansfield's death on June 29, 1967 was from anything other than a car accident, she's still the subject of a particularly gory urban legend. It's long been rumored that the actress was decapitated, but that wasn't the case according to the police report. It seems that a widely-circulated photo of the accident scene with the actress' wig lying outside the car may have misled some into believing otherwise.      Known as \\"The Father of the Western,\\" Thomas Ince was a famed silent film actor, producer, writer and director in the 1910s and early 1920s. On Nov. 15, 1924, on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst, Ince fell ill and was returned to shore. He succumbed to heart failure, on Nov. 19, but in the newspaper that evening it was reported that Ince was shot on Hearst's yacht. So, what possibly happened? In one version of events, Hearst allegedly walked in on Marion Davies -- whom he was in love with -- and Charlie Chaplin in a compromising position. During the ensuing struggle, Ince arrived and was accidentally shot. Another theory posits that Hearst shot Ince thinking he was Chaplin. The Peter Bogdanovich-directed film 'The Cat's Meow' with Kirsten Dunst focused on Ince's mysterious death. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Ince died on Nov. 15. He died on Nov. 19.      On Aug. 5, 1962, 36-year-old Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her home, after overdosing on barbiturates. The coroner's report listed Monroe's death as probable suicide, but many -- including the first LAPD officer to the scene -- believe she was murdered. But skeptics say there was no trace of drugs in Monroe's stomach, meaning she didn't swallow the drugs. They also say she was covered in bruises, including a major one on her hip. The toxicologist on the case wanted to examine her to understand how the drugs got into her system, but the initial examination destroyed organs. Another suspicious sign was revealed that Monroe had enough chemicals in her system to kill 10 people, but intravenous injection was ruled out by examiners. At the time of her death, Monroe was allegedly involved in a relationship with John F. Kennedy, and perhaps his brother, Robert. FBI files released in 2006 showed that Monroe was considered a security risk after cavorting with known communists during a vacation in Mexico.      In 1951, George Reeves became Superman on television. It was the biggest role of his career, and the one that sank it as well: Reeves could never escape the shadow of playing Superman -- he was reportedly cut out of 'From Here to Eternity' after test audiences shouted, \\"There's Superman!\\" at the screen -- and, on June 16, 1959, killed himself because of depression over his career. Or maybe he didn't. While the official cause of death is suicide -- Reeves was found laying naked on his bed, face up, with a gun between his feet on the floor -- many believe he was the victim of an accidental shooting or murder. It was rumored that George's former girlfriend, Toni Mannix, ordered a hit on him after he broke up with her. Mannix died from Alzheimer's disease in 1983, but in 1999, Los Angeles publicist Edward Lozzi said that Mannix confessed to him that she told a priest she was responsible for Reeves's murder. In 2006, a film about Reeves life and death called 'Hollywoodland' was released. Ben Affleck played the doomed Superman      Between 1926 and 1935, Thelma Todd appeared in over 120 films, including the Marx Brothers' 'Horse Feathers' and 'Monkey Business.' On Dec. 16, 1935, Todd was found dead in the garage of actress Jewel Carmen, the former wife of Todd's lover and business partner. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Police found that Todd had spent the night before her death at a popular Hollywood restaurant, where she had an argument with her ex-husband; she then retreated to Carmen's home, which was a block away from a restaurant that she owned. Whether foul play was involved in the death remains up for debate. Some believe Todd was targeted for extortion, while others wonder if she was locked inside the garage by a murderer. Blood was found on her head and dress, leading some to believe she was knocked unconscious before being exposed to the gas. Complicating matters? Todd's ex-husband was murdered two years later.      On June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were found murdered at Brown Simpson's home. Evidence at the scene pointed to Nicole's ex-husband, O.J. Simpson, as the prime suspect in their murders. On June 17, 1994, Simpson, a Hall of Fame football player and actor, was set to turn himself in, but he tried to escape with friend Al Cowlings in the infamous \\"Ford Bronco Chase.\\" Simpson was eventually caught and at his trial, pleaded not guilty to killing his ex-wife and Goldman. Simpson was found not guilty of the murders on Oct. 3, 1995, but later he was found liable for the wrongful death of Ron Goldman in a civil case which forced Simpson to pay the family 33.5 million in damages. He's currently serving 33 years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery after breaking into a Las Vegas hotel room to steal memorabilia. Simpson is eligible for parole in 2017, when he'll likely continue to search for the real killers of Nicole and Ron.      Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actor, became known as Black Dahlia in 1947 after she was found murdered, her body naked and severed in two, in a vacant lot in Hollywood, California.      The 'Hogan's Hero' star was murdered on June 29, 1978, allegedly bludgeoned to death with what might have been a camera tripod. Crane had a voracious sexual appetite and often filmed his escapades with the help of a man named John Henry Carpenter, who police suspected in Crane's death. No charges were filed against Carpenter until 1990, but Carpenter was acquitted because of a lack of evidence. The murder remains unsolved, but authorities believe Carpenter was the killer. He died in 1998.      Rapper and actor Tupac Shakur was killed on Sept. 9, 1996 in Las Vegas after attending the Mike Tyson vs. Bruce Seldon boxing match. Video surveillance from the MGM Grand showed Shakur and his entourage fighting with an alleged Crips gang member. Later, as a passenger en route to a Vegas club, Shakur was killed by a shooter in a car that pulled alongside him. No one has been charged in Shakur's death, but theories contend it had to do possibly with the fight earlier that night or a long-simmering feud with East Coast rapper Notorious B.I.G.      On July 18, 1966, Bobby Fuller, who sang \\"I Fought The Law,\\" was found dead in a car parked outside his Hollywood home. An autopsy report stated that Fuller's face, chest, and side were covered in hemorrhages likely caused by gasoline vapors and heat. The coroner checked \\"accident\\" and \\"suicide\\" as causes of death. Those checks, however, were accompanied by question marks, leading some to believe that Fuller was actually murdered.      B-movie actress Lana Clarkson was killed by Phil Spector in the music producer's California mansion on Feb. 3, 2003. They had met in the House of Blues earlier that night and Clarkson was killed by a gunshot to the face. Spector denied the murder charges, claiming her death was accidental and that she had \\"kissed the gun.\\" A judge declared a mistrial when a jury couldn't reach a verdict, but another jury found Spector guilty of second-degree murder in 2009. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison.      On June 4, 2009, David Carradine was found dead in a hotel room in central Bangkok, Thailand, where he was shooting his latest film \\"Stretch.\\" Speculation pointed to death by suicide, given that police found Carradine naked and hanging by a rope in the room's closet. However, two autopsies later claimed that the death was not a suicide, leading many to accept the theory that Carradine died from accidental suffocation during autoerotic asphyxiation, a pleasure that his ex-wives claimed he enjoyed.      Grace Kelly was an American movie star who married Monaco's Prince Rainier III in 1956, raising her profile as she became a royal. She died in 1982 while driving with her daughter in France, apparently suffering a stroke while in the driver seat on a mountainous road. Her daughter survived, but suffered serious injuries.      On March 31, 1993, Brandon Lee died after being shot by actor Michael Massee on the set of his latest film, \\"The Crow.\\" The fatal wound, which struck Lee's abdomen, was fired from a gun that was hastily rigged with improperly constructed dummy rounds and used without approval from the film's hired weapons coordinator, who had been dismissed early that night. The death was ruled accidental and no charges were filed.      English musician Kirsty MacColl, well-known for writing hits in the 1980s like \\"They Don't Know\\" for Tracy Ullman, died at age 41 in a Mexican boating accident on Dec. 18, 2000. While diving at a reef near Cozumel, a speedboat zipped through waters towards her sons. In an effort to save them, MacColl was hit by the boat and nearly cut in half by the propeller. The boat that killed her was owned by Mexican supermarket mogul Guillermo González Nova, who was on board with family and a crew member José Cen Yam. Cen Yam claimed he piloted the boat, leading to a conviction and small fine. But MacColl's boyfriend said Nove was at the helm and critics believe Cen Yam took the fall for the wealthy patriarch.      Actor Jon-Erik Hexum's cause of death is no mystery, but it's certainly one of the most peculiar in Hollywood history. The actor died on Oct. 18, 1984 when he accidentally took his own life on set of the NBC show \\"Cover Up.\\" While on break the actor was playing around with a prop gun that had been loaded with blanks and he jokingly put the barrel to his head and then fired. The actor apparently didn't realize that blanks use paper or plastic wadding to seal gunpowder into the cartridge, and can be dangerous when fired at close range. Hexum's injuries ultimately left him brain-dead.      Eighties teen heartthrob Corey Haim passed away unexpectedly at the age of 39 in the spring of 2010. The actor -- whose Hollywood career as a youngster included roles in films like \\"Lost Boys\\" and \\"License to Drive\\" -- had publicly struggled with prescription drug abuse and made news when he claimed he had been sexually abused at age 14 by an acquaintance of his then-best friend Corey Feldman. Haim got attention again in 2008 when he ran an advertisement in VARIETY stating he was ready to work and was serious about a comeback. But Haim became destitute and increasingly troubled. In March 2010, his mother called the police in a frantic message that leaked online: \\"Oh my God. I think my son is dead\\" before administering CPR. Haim's death was later said to be due to pneumonia and a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs.      In 1984, the comedy world lost one of it's finest entertainers -- or at least they think they did. Known for his elaborate stunts and ability to toy with an audience's emotions, Andy Kaufman and his death were surrounded by mystery as the 35-year-old star passed away from an undisclosed illness. Kaufman claimed that if he were to fake his own death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004.      The presence of multiple anti-anxiety medications and the general anesthetic Propofol in Jackson's system prompted a murder investigation into the pop icon's June 25, 2009 death. While some say that Jackson was heavily addicted to the pain medicines, a court convicted Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, of involuntary manslaughter on Nov. 7, 2011, for administering the lethal dose.      On April 4, 1958, underworld bodyguard Johnny Stompanato was stabbed to death outside the Beverly Hills home of his girlfriend actress Lana Turner. While Cheryl Craine, Turner's then teenage daughter, claimed that she stabbed \\"Handsome Harry\\" while defending her mother, skeptics have argued that it was in fact Turner who killed Stompanato, only to place the blame on her daughter who she knew would face minimal consequences.      Heath Ledger, 28, passed away on a chilly January afternoon in 2008, having just completed filming the role of a lifetime -- his brilliant turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" -- vaulting his career to new heights. Just two years after his Oscar-nominated performance in \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" Ledger's body was found naked and not breathing by his masseuse. His death was deemed accidental by the Chief Medical Examiner of New York. They wrote in a statement: \\"We have concluded that the manner of his death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications.\\"      On May 4, 2001, after enjoying an Italian dinner at Vitello's Restaurant with her celebrity husband, Robert Blake, Bonnie Lee Bakley was shot in the head while seated in a car around the corner from the eatery. Blake, the star of TV's \\"Baretta\\" in the 1970s, claimed that when the shots were fired he was retrieving his own gun from the restaurant, which he carried for protection. The gun he admitted carrying didn't match the bullet that killed Bakley, but critics contended he hired a hit man to blast her. Blake was acquitted of his wife's murder in 2005, but was later found responsible in a civil case for causing her death. His defense team suggested many people wanted to Bakley dead, including Marlon Brando's son. Bakley was on probation for fraud when she married Blake.      On Nov. 22, 1997, Australian musician and actor Michael Hutchence was discovered dead in Room 524 of Double Bay, Sydney's Ritz-Carlton hotel. A coroner who found alcohol and drugs later determined the incident to be death by suicide, but years later, Hutchence's partner at the time of his death, Paula Yates, came out claiming his death was possibly an accidental suffocation brought on by autoerotic asphyxiation. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Thelma Todd was a popular actress in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Sadly, she was found dead inside a garage, sitting behind the steering wheel of her car.

Step 4: Provide the answers Once I have all the necessary information, I would provide the user with answers to their questions. Answers: 1. Transferring from state board to CBSE board in 11th and 12th grade largely depends on the CBSE board's policies and the specific requirements for students transferring from a state board. Generally, students may transfer to CBSE board in 11th grade after completing 10th in a state board, provided they fulfill certain criteria like passing the 10th standard exams and submitting the required documents within a specific period. 2. Changing the board from 11th state to 12th CBSE is typically not recommended, as it could create difficulty for students to adapt to the change in curricula and examination patterns between two different boards within a short period. However, it may be possible to do so if there are exceptional circumstances and the proper documentation is provided. 3. The two questions do not have the exact same meaning. The first question asks whether the student can transfer to the CBSE board for both 11th and 12th grades after completing 10th grade in the state board.

Police in the city of Perris responded at around 11:20 a.m. to reports of an air emergency at the popular skydiving site of Perris Valley airport. They arrived to find Granger, an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers, suffering serious injuries after a parachuting accident. Tragic: Jason Granger, pictured with his family, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. Perris Valley Skydiving general manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld told the Press Enterprise the man was coming in for a landing when he made a turn at low altitude. Such turns increase a jumper's speed and are prohibited below 300 feet at that drop zone for that reason, Brodsky-Chenfeld said. He said he didn't know Granger's elevation when he turned, but it was very low. Injuries: Granger, pictured left and right, was an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers. Sad: Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. 'We're not sure why he made that turn,' Brodsky-Chenfeld told the newspaper. He added that the cause of the crash had nothing to do with equipment failure, weather conditions or collisions. The man was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said. Brodsky-Chenfeld said he had brought a family member to Perris Valley on Friday but in the fatal fall hew as jumping alone.

In this photo of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin, Canadian defendant Omar Khadr attends a hearing in the courthouse for the U.S. military war crimes commission at the Camp Justice compound on Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, April 28, 2010.      WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The youngest prisoner and last Westerner held in the Guantanamo military base, Omar Khadr, was sent to finish his sentence in his native Canada on Saturday, the Canadian government said.      Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said that Khadr, who was a 15-year-old fighting in Afghanistan when captured in 2002, had been flown from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a military base in Trenton, Ontario and transferred to the province's Millhaven maximum-security prison.      Khadr's case has been controversial both in Canada and abroad given his age when he was captured, the nature of his detention and hearing, and the reluctance of Canadian officials to accept his return.      \\"I am satisfied the Correctional Service of Canada can administer Omar Khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of Canadians is protected during incarceration,\\" Toews said in Winnipeg, Manitoba.      A U.S. war crimes tribunal in 2010 sentenced Khadr, now 26, to 40 years in prison, although he was expected to serve just a few more years under a deal that included his admission he was an al Qaeda conspirator who murdered a U.S. soldier.      Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to charges that included murdering American Army medic Christopher Speer with a grenade in a 2002 firefight, conspiring with al Qaeda to commit terrorist acts, making roadside bombs to target U.S. troops in Afghanistan, spying on American military convoys and providing material support for terrorism.      Khadr was the first person since World War Two to be prosecuted in a war crimes tribunal for acts committed as a juvenile. He was the youngest prisoner still at Guantanamo, but younger boys were previously held there.      Canadian-born Khadr was taken to Afghanistan by his father, a senior al Qaeda member who apprenticed the boy to a group of bomb makers who opened fire when U.S. troops came to their compound. Khadr was captured in the firefight, during which he was blinded in one eye and shot twice in the back.      HAPPY TO BE HOME      \\"He's finding it hard to believe that this has finally happened,\\" said John Norris, one of Khadr's lawyers, according to a Canadian Press report. \\"His spirits are good. He is very, very happy to be home.\\"      In a written statement, Toews said Canada received Khadr's application for transfer from the United States on April 13, 2012. He said U.S. officials assured Canada it would receive a videotape copy of an interview with Khadr, but it, along with other videotapes of interviews and unedited reports, was not sent until this month.      Former Canadian ambassador Gar Pardy, however, said Canada's Conservative government, which cultivates an image of being tough on crime, dragged out the transfer.      \\"I think the government was mainly very mean-spirited in how it handled the case,\\" Pardy said to CTV News.      The Canadian Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Canada breached Khadr's rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him in Guantanamo Bay in 2003 and 2004 and sharing the results with the United States. Khadr's continuing detention meant his rights were still being infringed, the judges ruled. The top court also said that Canada was not obliged to repatriate him, however.      Toews said he remains concerned that Khadr \\"idealizes\\" his father and denies Ahmed Khadr's association with al Qaeda. The Canadian public safety minister said he is also troubled by how \\"radicalized\\" Khadr has become from his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Guantanamo Bay.      The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that it transferred Khadr to Canada, leaving 166 detainees at Guantanamo.      In the 2008 presidential election campaign, President Barack Obama promised to close the Guantanamo prison during his term, but that pledge has gone unfulfilled amid security concerns among Americans and opposition from Congress, which enacted laws making it more difficult to transfer prisoners from Guantanamo.      The transfer represents progress, but the Guantanamo prison should close immediately, said Suzanne Nossel, Amnesty International USA's executive director.      Canadian authorities should also investigate Khadr's allegations of torture while in the prison, she said.      \\"Canada now has the chance to right some of these wrongs.\\"      Khadr's sentence will expire on October 30, 2018.      (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Hodgson in Toronto and Jane Sutton in Miami; Editing by Bill Trott and Sandra Maler) ||||| OTTAWA -      After a slew of court challenges demanding his homecoming and a decade in Guantanamo Bay, convicted terrorist Omar Khadr is back in Canada.      Khadr landed at CFB Trenton military base Saturday morning after being transported from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, aboard a U.S. government plane and was then brought to Millhaven maximum-security prison in Bath, Ont.      In a hastily organized news conference in Winnipeg, Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said Khadr is now in the hands of Canada's correctional services, which he is satisfied it can “administer Omar Khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of Canadians is protected during incarceration.”      The 26-year-old Toronto-native struck a plea deal in 2010 that saw him sentenced to eight years in prison for five war crimes, including killing U.S. special forces medic Christopher Speer 10 years ago in an Afghan firefight.      He was captured in 2002 when he was 15.      Despite green-lighting the repatriation, Toews expressed several concerns about the case to the media Saturday.      These included that Khadr has \\"had very little contact with Canadian society and therefore will require substantial management in order to ensure safe reintegration\\" and that he has \\"participated in terrorist training, military operations, and meetings involving al-Qaida leadership.\\"      Brydie Bethell, one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers, said her client is relieved to be back on Canadian soil, and described him as being “in a state of disbelief and really pinching himself wondering when he's going to wake up from this dream.”      “This is someone the correctional authorities will think is a miracle. He's the kind of prisoner they hope everyone would be,” she added.      His advocates — many who maintain he was a child soldier at the time of his capture — were cheering his return Saturday.      They included Amnesty International Canada and the federal New Democrats and Liberals — though the Grits didn't push for his repatriation when they were in power before 2006.      Ottawa could be on the hook for multi-million dollar payout after the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 Khadr's charter rights were violated during his time in U.S. custody.      A Canadian citizen and the last Western detainee held at Guantanamo Bay, Khadr had been petitioning the Canadian government for his return since as early as 2005.      As per a diplomatic agreement signed between the U.S. and Canada in 2010 regarding Khadr's repatriation, his personal transfer application landed on Toews' desk in March 2011 and the minister received the formal U.S. application in April. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Omar Khadr, who was the youngest prisoner at Guantanamo military base, has been sent to Canada to finish his time in jail. He was only 15 years old when he was captured while fighting in Afghanistan in 2002. Many people had different opinions about his case because he was so young when he was caught, and also because of how he was treated in jail.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Trump's stance on China change after the election?

Q: Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Nigel Sherratt, 47, from Cannock, engaged in messages of \\"sexual content\\" with a fictitious 14-year-old girl, played by a member of Soul Survivors. He was later confronted by the group, with footage streamed on Facebook. Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh wants his death to be a \\"lesson\\". Mr Sherratt's sister described the group as \\"judge, jury and executioner\\". Mr Sherratt agreed to meet a fake adult female - also played by Soul Survivors - in a pub car park on 3 August 2018 but was confronted about chat logs relating to the teenage girl, the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court was told. The men from the group were aggressive, using raised voices and threats about what might happen to him, the hearing was told. Mr Sherratt was arrested over the allegations of potential communications with a child and held by Staffordshire Police overnight. He was released under investigation while inquiries continued but was found dead by his brother Mark on 5 August. Toxicology tests found he had a fatal concoction of overdosed drugs in his body. 'Judge, jury and executioner' \\"I sincerely doubt that suicide ever crossed Nigel's mind until that day,\\" said his sister Lynn Thacker, whose evidence was read by coroner's officer Andy Heathcote. \\"If it was not for the unjust actions he would be alive today.

There's no safeguarding.\\" Coroner Mr Haigh ruled Mr Sherratt died as a result of a suicide, which was subject to his learning difficulties. \\"I hope these sad circumstances might be a form of lesson to those [groups] that indulge in this sort of activity,\\" he added.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. walk opposite left thrice and run right twice Output:","output":"I_TURN_LEFT, I_WALK, I_WALK, I_WALK, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN, I_RUN"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: There are many different creatures that are easy to see for people even in a city here. Options: - forest - library - woods - black lagoon - zoo  Explain why a human would choose \\"zoo\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"First, I would analyze the question, which is asking about places where many different creatures can be easily seen by people, even in a city setting.  The next step is to carefully review each of the options presented:  - forest  - library  - woods  - black lagoon  - zoo  Among the choices given, the forest and the woods are habitats where one would expect to see many different creatures, but these are natural environments and are not typically located within a city where the creatures would be easily visible to people.  The black lagoon might evoke thoughts of aquatic creatures, but again, such habitats don't usually exist in city settings.  When it comes to the library, while it's a common city establishment, it's not a place designed to house or display creatures.  Finally, examining the \\"zoo\\" option, it becomes clear why this would be the correct answer. Zoos exist in many cities, making it feasible for people to see a variety of creatures there. The main purpose of a zoo is to house and display a myriad of animals to the public for educational and conservational purposes. Therefore, the zoo is the choice that best fits the question's criteria—it's a city venue where different creatures can be easily seen by people.  In summary, \\"zoo\\" is the logical choice as it aligns most closely with the requirements set out in the initial question."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
