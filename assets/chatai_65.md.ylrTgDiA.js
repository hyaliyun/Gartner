That’s why DC comics has their own Thor. That’s why a movie studio I have never heard of could make a movie entitled Thor: End of Days that is as blatant a rip-off as I have ever seen. [LINKED_TEXT: THOR: End of Days| Invincible Entertainment] [URL: https://www.invincibleent.com/thor-end-of-days-movie?wix-vod-video-id=5ec33935cec94b7ea0001198b7db44b2&wix-vod-comp-id=comp-k7gub2lh] It’s why the New Zealand TV show, The Almighty Johnsons, about incarnations of the Norse gods could have Thor as a character. Marvel only owns the very, very specific version of Thor that appears in its comics. Marvel’s copyright covers works it published featuring Thor. And it’s trademark applies in the most narrow possible of ways to specifically their version of Thor. Anyone can use Thor or any element of Norse mythology in any work. And as long as they can plausibly claim that it is based on the myths themselves and not the very specific version of Thor appearing in Marvel comics, then there’s nothing Disney can do about it. Now a character like the Enchantress who is original to the comics… well she’s much more well protected from infringement. If anyone gets tripped up and successfully sued by Disney it would far more likely be because they used something unique to the comics, like the Enchantress or the Warriors Three, than because they used Thor himself (no matter how similar to the comic book version he is)."},{"instruction":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","output":"There are many reasons why people might stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships.

To tap into the potential, consider key factors. Choose a niche wisely, drive traffic, and craft quality content. Monetize through ads, affiliate marketing, sponsored content, or digital products. Realistic expectations vary with stages—starting, mid-level, and advanced. Boost earnings with consistency, diversified income streams, audience engagement, SEO optimization, and networking. Learn from successful case studies: for Example, Blogger A earns 5,000/month via affiliate marketing, Blogger B makes 2,000/month from sponsored content, and Blogger C generates 8,000/month selling courses. In the journey from blog to bank, persistence, strategy, and dedication are the building blocks.

Having a strong social media presence offers numerous benefits to your business. You have a larger reach to customers outside your immediate area. Leveraging your social media marketing correctly can profit you more customers and sales. Living in the digital age, it is important to learn how to take advantage of this unique opportunity to grow your business. Firstly, different social media apps and websites combine billions of active users daily. Reaching even the smallest fraction of these users can take your business to the next level. Having engaging content, compelling designs, and promotion will attract more customers who have not found your business yet. One of the benefits of social media is the advanced tools it offers to reach a specific audience. If you are a business that sells kitchen tools, you don’t want to spend money on advertisements that will be sent to kids, teenagers, gamers, etc. You would want that ad to target someone in their mid-20s and up, a mother or grandmother, cooks, and chefs. You want your advertisement to target an audience that will be interested in your product. Being able to target your audience by interest, location, and demographics is some of the few ways to narrow your reach to your target audience. This allows you to maximize the return on your advertisement investments. Having a strong social media presence can give any business a competitive edge. Consumers that have to decide between two businesses will be more than likely to choose the business with the most recognition and strong reputation. In order to maintain this competitive edge, your business has to actively engage with your customers. Leveraging your social media correctly will set you apart from other competitors. To be a successful business, you need feedback to learn and improve on. Social media has many tools to help you with. Social media provides you with files of data and feedback from your audience. The data includes engagements, demographics, reach, and more. Using this data you can modify your product or marketing strategies to better relate with your audience. If you haven’t noticed the trend throughout this reading; relating to your customer is extremely important. Social media pushes you to build a meaningful relationship with your audience. Consistent efforts to interact and push out engaging content will build that trusting bond with your customers. Having a brand with loyal and supportive customers will create a fulfilling and long-lasting business. In conclusion, social media marketing offers numerous benefits for businesses in the digital space. Increasing social media engagements and building customer relationships are some of the few ways to thrive on social media. To create a long-lasting social media brand, you need to be fully committed and engaged in the entire process. With the correct marketing strategies and commitment, you can elevate your business to the next level.

Anakin Skywalker was an unusual case and was chosen by a Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, to become his apprentice. Jinn chose to do this because he was convinced Anakin was the Chosen One. The Jedi Council did not want Jinn to accept Skywalker as his apprentice, regardless of how powerful he was, because he was too old, but Jinn ignored them. When Jinn died, his last words were a plea to Kenobi to take Anakin as his apprentice because Jinn was sure Anakin was the Chosen One. The Council relented and allowed Kenobi to do so. The Jedi Council was not even going to allow Anakin to become a Jedi, and only because of extraordinary conditions and happenings did they finally allow it to happen. This would most likely never happen for anyone else."},{"instruction":"What is IPL and its full form?","output":"What is IPL full form IPL full form Indian Premier Leage Read More —: [LINKED_TEXT: IPL - 2021 Stadium List : IPL- 2021 कितने स्टेडियम मे होने वाली है] [URL: https://www.buddybaz.com/2021/04/ipl-2021-stadium-list-ipl-2021.html] IPL is called a professional cricket game.

I went to a conservative Christian college, where alcohol use was prohibited. So, being normal young people, my friends and I broke the rules now and then. During our senior year, we started collecting our empty bottles because we had the same concern that the asker had. We didn’t want to get caught disposing of the evidence of our crime. The night before our graduation, as we were gleefully creating more empty bottles, we hit on the idea of taking all our empties and covering the Dean of Students’ car with them. We weren’t malicious. We liked her just fine, and she was a family friend of mine. Still, we wanted to make a statement, and under the influence of impending freedom and plentiful alcohol, having our parents show up for graduation and see the evidence of our crime seemed like a great idea. So, that’s what we did. We went to the parking lot and gently covered every available horizontal surface on her car with bottles. We never got caught and we never found out what happened as a result of our prank, but it is a glorious (if fuzzy) memory. Where can I discreetly get rid of wine bottles?"},{"instruction":"Do British people wholeheartedly agree with Suella Braverman when she said “Boris Johnson is one of the greatest prime ministers ever”?","output":"Suella Braverman is so deluded, the vast majority of the British electret don't just hate Boris Johnson, they despise him like they do her.

One day, he told me that he had found a good way. It is the story about my little nephew. “Dad, how do you do this question?” Hearing his son’s question, the father frowned. He don’t know how many times his son had asked questions. Whenever he encounters a problem, he asks his parents for help, and he doesn’t even know his own thinking. Seeing the question his son brought, Dad’s brows deepened. Such a question is not difficult for his son at all. As long as he uses his brain and thinks a little, the answer will come out. “You take a good look at the question yourself, then think about it, you will know the answer.” Dad didn’t want to tell his son the answer directly, he wanted his son to try to think for himself. The son who didn’t get the answer returned to the table, frowning and looking at the question in front of him, he couldn’t do anything. Looking at his son who was thinking hard, he felt that this was useless. So, Dad put down the newspaper in his hand, came to his son and sat down. Seeing his father sitting next to him, the son thought that his father was willing to tell him the answer. However, Dad still did not say the answer, but took a pen and a piece of paper. Write down the conditions listed in the title on the paper. At first the son didn’t understand what his father was doing, so he stared at the paper closely. Slowly, he saw the answer from the paper. So he wrote the answer in his own way. During this period, the father didn’t say a word, but only used his eyes to encourage his son to find the answer by himself. From then on, when his son encountered a problem again, he no longer asked others the first time, but tried to think for himself and find the answer by himself. Einstein once said: “Learning to think independently and judge independently is more important than acquiring knowledge. People who do not make up their minds to cultivate the habit of thinking will lose the greatest joy in life.” If children do not have the quality of independent thinking and judgment, they may lack independence throughout their lives, let alone any breakthroughs and creations. Therefore, parents should provide children with as many independent thinking and problem-solving opportunities as possible from an early age, so that children can grow into talents who can think and judge independently. Independent thinking can enrich children’s imagination and develop children’s intelligence."},{"instruction":"Can a sociopath feel happiness or have mania/hypomania?","output":"I’m manic right now actually.

I suppose I could tell you about the swinger party I went to a couple weeks ago. All I wanted to do actually was be a fly on the wall. For real. The whole group thing grossed me out and once that happened everything is ruined. People got annoying too. It felt like I was on a set for a porno which that was interesting.

As someone who has studied the topic of happiness extensively, I know many factors contribute to our generation's perceived unhappiness. One major factor is the increasing pressure to compare ourselves to others on social media constantly. We are bombarded with images of people living seemingly perfect lives, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with our lives. Additionally, social media can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, as we spend more time scrolling through our phones than engaging in meaningful face-to-face interactions. Another factor is the societal pressure to achieve success at a young age. This pressure can come from our families, peers, and even ourselves as we compare our progress. Many of us feel the need to have our lives figured out by our mid-20s, which can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. I have experienced both of these factors in my own life. In my early 20s, I struggled with feelings of inadequacy and comparison as I saw my friends achieving seemingly great things on social media. It wasn't until I took a step back and realized that people only share their highlight reels on social media that I could break free from these negative thought patterns. Additionally, I focus more on cultivating meaningful relationships with people rather than solely relying on online interactions. In terms of the pressure to achieve success, I struggled with this as I entered the workforce. I felt like I needed to figure everything out right away, leading to stress and anxiety. However, gaining more experience and perspective, I realized that success is more than just a one-size-fits-all concept. I learned to set goals and pace myself rather than constantly comparing myself to others."},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

She said her daughter was not allowed to go, as there was a lot of Evil around on Halloween night, and the children could be infected. ….This from a physicist! How could she believe Evil was infectious? On one night of the year only!!! And surely the evidence of her own eyes would show her that these children were not infected by Evil when they were dressing up.

But I would reframe the question to ‘What should I choose, a dual degree or a BTech in IIST?’ because one is not better than other. It is just different. Dual degree program at IIST is for people who are interested in pure science rather than engineering aspect of it. The five fields offered for a dual degree are different from Aerospace or Avionics. In a general sense you can say that if you are interested in pure research at a later stage, then you can choose a dual degree program. It helps you save an year when you decide to do a PhD later. But, it is not neccessarily the case. I did BTech in Aerospace Engineering at IIST and worked in ISRO for 3 years. But, since I was interested in fundamental research (which doesn’t seem to happen a lot in ISRO), I pursued MS in Sweden and now I am doing my PhD in Netherlands. When I took Aerospace, I didn’t know whether I wanted to research or not. You are also too young to know whether you want to do research in atmospheric science or astrophysics, or whether you want to work in ISRO and build rockets and satellites. So, in my opinion there is no wrong choice here. Whatever you choose, you can always change later. If you are very well informed as a kid and are interested specifically in Astrophysics/Astronomy or Earth sciences, then take dual degree because that will increase you chances of working in Space Physics Lab (SCL) or Physical Research Lab (PRL) which are mainly focused on fundamental research in Astronomy and Earth Sciences. If you are an engineer by heart (if you like building things and if you like Jugaad) then by all means go for BTech. I hope this helps. Send me a pm if you need more specific advice.

But how do people who follow this diet manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, staying hydrated is key. Drink lots of water or switch things up with some herbal tea or flavored water. This can help you feel fuller and prevent hunger pangs. Additionally, when you do eat, go for nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins. These will help keep you feeling fuller for longer. It's also important to choose low glycemic index foods and stay away from sugary snacks and processed foods, as they can cause your blood sugar to spike and then drop, leaving you feeling hungry again soon after eating. Mindful eating is another helpful practice. Slow down and savor your food. Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues to prevent overeating. Planning is also crucial. If you know you'll only be eating once or twice a day, it's important to plan your meals ahead of time to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need. It's important to keep in mind that intermittent fasting isn't for everyone, and it's crucial to listen to your body's needs. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to make sure you're meeting your nutritional needs."},{"instruction":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"I have attended both private and public schools at different points in my life. And while I only attended a private school for 4 years (K-3), I feel I have had enough of an experience to know for sure. When it comes to education, yes, private schools tend to be much better. Smaller class sizes allow for more personalized instruction. This, in turn, creates more success. in the students, and allows them to grow better. Some of them also offer religious classes. So, education-wise, yes, private schools are head-and-shoulders above public schools. However, in the atmosphere, private schools also have a chance to have a much more toxic environment, at least from the students. The students who are better off can feel like they have the right to do anything to the students who are less wealthy. And, if the families of the wealthier students donate enough money to the school, the administration can be too afraid of losing that funding to do anything about it. So, there are ways where private schools are better than public (such as the education), but some ways that public schools can be better than private (the enviroment/atmosphere). If you wish to get the best of both worlds, you should pick a charter school. -Allons-y!"},{"instruction":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie “300”?

With the chaos swirling all around there was no time to draw it out, so General Loan made it quick. I knew General Loan because after the war he opened a pizza and sub shop in a strip mall two blocks from my house. It was a good place to grab a quick bite and I was single at the time so I ate there often. Because we were both former air force pilots during that war, we had some interesting discussions. His face is so famous that I used to take out-of-town guests there for a quick dinner and, as we were sitting and eating, I’d ask So, see that guy behind the counter? Does he look familiar? At first they looked at me like I was nuts, and I could tell they were thinking, How in the hell would a random Vietnamese guy who owns a pizza joint in Burke, Virginia look familiar to me? But then they looked. They stared. Then they said OMG! He was a very nice person, who at that moment in history was doing his duty to protect the citizens of his town as well as his own family. And then he moved to Burke and continued to take care of his family, grateful that he didn’t need to kill anyone to do it.

It is a technique of expressing one’s feelings and thoughts with the help of words. “Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on.”- Louis L’ Amour. You can write on whatever topic you like and you can explain things magnificently through your writings. Here are some things that aspiring writers should know about writing: · Write regularly and read more- For being a successful writer one should practice writing routinely and should read more as the more you do so, the more innovative ideas you will get and the better you will become. · Select your niche- Select the genre on which you would like to construct the story or writings. There are aspects like fiction, mystery, non-fiction, romance, biography, short stories, etc. By selecting your niche, it will be easy for you to focus on that specific area and build on it further. · Understand your audience group and their requirements- Be mindful of which audience group is mainly targeting and what are their requirements. For instance, you are writing a self-help book then your main audience group targets are the youth and the adults, so you need to understand their requirements and write down your views and ideas in such a manner that it captures the interest of the audience and increases their curiosity and interest to read more of what you have written. · Check that your texts are free from plagiarism- One should always check that what he/she has written is original and not someone else’s idea. Your text should reflect your writing style and form. Also, be particular regarding the vocabulary and grammar. I hope you like this answer.

However, I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of scientists, scientific organizations, and governments around the world agree that climate change is real, and that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise and the climate to change in ways that will have severe consequences if not addressed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. They have stated that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. There is also a consensus among scientists that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, the world will warm by several degrees by the end of this century, leading to increased heat waves, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and more severe weather events. It's worth noting that, though Climate change is a complex issue with many different factors, with a great number of scientific studies, data analysis and evidence-based research that support the scientific consensus on climate change.

I am a working musician and, as you would expect, travel a lot. I have been noticing strange things happening when I get home. Her mobile phone rings and she steps outside to answer it or she says, \\"I'll call you back later\\". When I ask her who called she gets evasive. Sometimes she goes out with friends but comes home late, getting dropped off around the corner and walking the rest of the way. I once picked up the extension while she was on the phone and she got very angry. A buddy of mine plays guitar in a band. He told me that my wife and some guy have been to his gigs. He wanted to borrow my guitar amp. That's when I got the idea to find out for myself what was really happening. I said, \\"Sure, you can use my amp but I want to hide behind it at the gig and see if she comes into the venue, and who she comes in with\\". He agreed. Saturday night came and I slipped behind my Marshall JCM800 half stack to get a good view. It wasn't long before I saw my wife come in with another guy. He bought them drinks and they sat down, conversing flirtatiously with each other. Then, after a while, he got up to go to the bathroom, and she started flirting with the bartender! She wrote something (I'm assuming her cell number) on a bar napkin and gave it to him. He gave her a wink and a nod. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My wife - the sweet little coquette!! At this point it was getting awfully warm for me. I was sweating. I could feel the heat coming off the back of the amp. It was at that moment, crouching down behind the amp, that I noticed that one of the tubes was not glowing as bright as the other three.

With a dedicated ministry and budget in its name, railways help large portions of the country’s population in running their daily businesses successfully. However, there are a few things you probably don’t know about our trains and how the entire system works. Read on, and maybe you can remember them; or simply be awed every-time you pass by something even remotely related to the railways. 1. Indian Railways is the largest railways network to be operated by a single government and is the world’s third largest network with a total length of 127,760 kms. 2. Indian Railways owned the longest railway platform in the world at Kharagpur with a length of 2,733 feet. Now, breaking the record, Gorakhpur station has recently taken its place with a span of 4,430 feet. 3. Two historical railway elements are included in the UNESCO’ World Heritage site list – the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, and the Indian Mountain Railways. The Indian Mountain Railways includes three railways – the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways, Nilgiri Mountain Railways and Kalka Shimla Railway. All three trains have been functional for some 100 years. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is a classic fusion of Gothic art with Indian architecture. 4. Indian Railways has five luxury trains. These are: Royal Rajasthan on Wheels,Palace on Wheels (Rajasthan),The Golden Chariot (Karnataka and Goa),The Maharajas’ Express (begins in Delhi but the itinerary differs) andThe Deccan Odyssey (begins in Maharashtra but itinerary differs). They are the pride of Indian Railways as they hold an eminent position among the luxury trains of the world. Palace on Wheels is the oldest one of them. 5. The Vivek Express (Dibrugarh to Kanyakumari) travels a distance of 4273 km, which is the longest run in the railways. The shortest run is taken by a few scheduled services between Nagpur and Ajni – a total of 3 kms. 6. Srirampur and Belapur are two different stations in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. They are both situated at the same point on the railway route, but are located on opposite sides of the track. 7. Mathura junction has the maximum number of routes emerging from it. 7 of them include – Broad Gauge (BG) line to Agra Cantt, BG line to Bharatpur, BG line to Alwar, BG line to Delhi, Metre Gauge (MG) line to Achnera, MG line to Vrindavan and MG line to Hathras. 8. The resonance frequency of the suspension for the coaches is kept as close as possible to 72 bpm or 1.2 Hz while designing. The human body is most comfortable at 1.2 Hz frequency as it’s one of the most fundamental frequencies of our bodies (normal heartbeat) – which is why people sleep soundly in trains. 9. The railways functions on an operating ratio of 94%, that is, it spends 94 paisa on every rupee that it earns. The amount of Rs. 4 saved from every Rs. 100 earned is minuscule and the revenues of the railways have been suffering because of the negligible revision of prices. 10. The diamond crossing (dubbed so by railways themselves), in Nagpur, is one-of-its-kind, from where trains go East, West, North and South. 11. The Indian Railways is constructing the world’s highest rail bridge over Chenab. The bridge will be 1,315 meters long and will use up to 25,000 tonnes of steel. The idea was initially conceived in 2008 but the project was paused due to safety concerns. The work, however, began in 2010 and it is expected to be completed this year. 12. The longest tunnel in the country is Pir Panjal Railway tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir which is 11.25 kms long. 13. The busiest junction in the country is Howrah junction in Kolkata with as many as 974 trains stopping there daily. 14. All the electric appliances (fans, lights) in rail coaches function at 110 volts instead of the Indian standard 220 volts. It is a very effective counter-measure against thieves! 15. The mascot for Indian Railways is Bholu, or Bholu the guard elephant, which was designed by National Institute of Design. It was unveiled on 16th April 2002. 16. The oldest working Indian locomotive still in use is the Fairy Queen, which worked with a steam engine. It was built in 1855. After retiring in 1909, it was relaunched in 1997 and operates as a tourist train between Delhi and Alwar. It travels at a speed 40 km/h. 17. The Indian Railways is the world’s eighth largest employer with a total of 1.4 million employees 18. Computerized reservations began in New Delhi in 1986. 19. Indian Railways launched an awareness campaign train on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2007, called the Red Ribbon Express. 20. India has eight Railway Museums – in Delhi, Pune, Kanpur, Mysore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ghum and Tiruchirappalli. Out of these, the National Railway Museum in Delhi is the largest rail museum in Asia. 21. Indian Railways, a mode of transport that connects the whole nation, is the largest rail network in Asia and second largest in the world. 22.The New Delhi Railway Station has the world's largest Route Relay Interlocking System, an achievement that has won the station a place in the Guinness Book of Records. 23.Indian Railways (IR) carries over 25 million passengers daily which is perhaps more than the entire population of Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania put together. Annually Indian Railways ferries 7.2 billion passengers (nearly 6x India's current population). 24.The Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corporation website is rather busy for it gets close to 12 lakh hits each minute. 25.The toilets found in Indian trains have always been a rather talked about feature but did you know that our trains got toilets only after Indian Railways completed about 50 years! 26. Indian Railways have always been the backbone of our country’s public transport system with 16 zones which cover a route of 65,808 km with 7,112 stations. 27.The Darjeeling toy train is still running on a steam engine that was made all the way back in 1881. 28.Longest station name: Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta on the Arakkonam-Renigunta section near Chennai. 29.Shortest station name: Ib, near Jharsuguda in Odisha and Od, near Anand in Gujarat. 30.The railway station of Navapur is built in two states; one half of it is in Maharashtra and the other half is in Gujarat. Even a train which halts at Navapur Railway station is stationed half in Maharashtra and half in Gujarat."},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"To tell you the truth I haven’t seen anything too horrible. Stafff are well trained and don’t attack like police officers. I’ve never seen them torture people like what happens to me when in cells. IF someone is out of control, they overwhelm them with people by ringing the alarm and summoning people to that area or room. Staff can misbehave as people do, and sometimes others will back the people up as nurses tend to do. That’s difficult. IT’s not nice watching someone being forced a medication by depo. Held down screaming. They forced me to have the wrong medication and I’d really like to make some changes surrounding that.

No way of knowing which until GNS locates the epicentre. If you have a grab bag ready take that, otherwise go as you are and fast. Higher ground, or a few miles inland. You may be able to return home within a few hours but you won’t know that for a while. Evacuation centres are only set up once it’s known where and if they’re needed."},{"instruction":"Would joining Ashoka university for BSc Physics be a good decision? As opposed to, say, DU or maybe IISER?","output":"Well B.Sc Mathematics both at Ashoka University and IISER Mohali is more or less the same and if a Student is coming from outside NCR or Punjab then he can go for either one as distance and locations would not matter much to him and the course structure and standards are also more or less the same. As for comparing DU with Ashoka or maybe IISER then these two institutes can never be near the top 3 colleges of DU – Stephens, SRCC and LSR. These are similar in Brand & educational quality to Harvard & Stanford of USA and Oxford, Cambridge of UK. Ashoka or IISER will never ever be able to provide that same Brand & Students profile (even if they provide Academic rigor). Other than these 3 top colleges of DU Ashoka is better than any other DU college. Of course the fees still would be of some concern but if money is not the primary consideration then Ashoka would be a clear choice of preference. Multidisciplinary course curriculum in Ashoka and IISER give them an edge over DU especially in the professional courses. Also the faculty at Ashoka would be a notch better than the DU. Ashoka and IISER being private institutions have a reputation to be taken care of and take the placements very seriously. Special care is being given to groom the students for the final event – the Placements. So from the trio of Ashoka, IISER and DU – Ashoka and IISER have the edge on DU, of course the top 3 of DU (Stephens, SRCC & LSR) are not taken into consideration. But if someone asks me for my honest opinion about doing a B.Sc Maths in NCR then Ashoka and IISER are topped by Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University). Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (Deemed to be University) also located at Greater Noida is perhaps one of the best institutes offering world class professional courses in streams of Management, Engineering, Science with Maths. Some of the differentiating features of B.Sc Mathematics course at Shiv Nadar IoE are: The B.Sc Mathematics (research) program here is of international standards and very popular among the students aspiring to take up mathematical studies to become learned and qualified mathematicians.Shiv Nadar IoE offers a unique multidisciplinary B.Sc course offering foundation and major subjects at initial and later stages respectively, in the course curriculum.Faculty is top class and drawn from top universities across the globe.Shiv Nadar IoE also has excellent facilities both for learning and staying which are the best in the industry.Placements at Shiv Nadar IoE have always been very impressive being almost 100% in every placement drive. However, the placements in B.Sc Maths have been very few with most of the passing out students opting for higher studies.Students take pride in calling themselves as scholars of Shiv Nadar IoE. So, in my personal opinion Shiv Nadar IoE is a much better choice than Ashoka, IISER and DU for doing a B.Sc Maths."},{"instruction":"Can you describe your wholeday routine at an IIT/NIT?","output":"Hey guys, so my routine is usually like everyone.

The biggest problem I have with my parents is \\"over controlling\\". My parents don't allow me to have snap chat or instagram, track me everywhere I go, and have very strict limits with everything. I can see why they do this because they want me to be safe and all, but I'm telling you right now that this is going to make us do bad things behind your backs. When you tell us we aren't allowed to do something or have something, it makes us want it so much more. For example, I've tried sneaking social media onto my phone, and other little things they tell me not to do or have. I understand parents want us to be safe and healthy human beings, but restricting everything and controlling everything is not the way to go. If you give us little privileges, we will slowly begin to understand how to use those privileges, and if we make a mistake with those privileges, we learn from those mistakes. In fact it's better to make mistakes as teenagers instead of waiting to make those mistakes as adults.

I think IQ tests are a great way of measuring a person’s intelligence. Not in a deep way, and not even in a particularly accurate way. However an IQ test is definitely a good, even great way, of measuring intelligence. A lot of smarter folk will say, “not really, I’m not really that smart, I’m just good at these kind of tests for some reason or another”. You see… to smart people, the tests seem a bit silly. However to those not as smart, the tests seem difficult, confusing, and it is very easy for them to agree with their smarter counterpart and also say it’s “silly”. The standard IQ test determines the general intelligence of all quite well in an overall sense. It separates smarter people from less smarter people relatively accurately (which covers a lot of people). I think it’s relatively accurate towards the middle of the group… the “one hundreds” (and below). It’s not as accurate at the higher side. Despite whether or not you find it silly, it works very well to differentiate smart from not so smart. What it’s not so good at, is differentiating “smart” from “very smart”. I believe it starts getting a bit curly at that level."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"Hello all !!

Some composers did turn works for piano into orchestral pieces — Ravel is well known for this — but most orchestral music tends to be conceived orchestrally from the outset. Composers have differed in their approaches to coming up with full orchestral scores. Sometimes a draft or a series of sketches are made in which there are quick notes about the plans for orchestration, which are then fully executed in a later pass over the music to produce the finished version, a little like a pencil or ink study in preparation for a painting. And sometimes composers work out the details in their heads, writing straight into a full score, watercolors and all. Which method works best depends on both the composer and the nature of the music. Reverse-engineering orchestral music into piano solo or duet arrangements — the opposite of the process suggested by the question — was common in the mid-to-late 19th and early 20th century. The publishers of Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Debussy, Stravinsky, and many others of that era often insisted on the creation of such arrangements, done or at least supervised by the composers themselves. The income stream generated from a symphonic work could be augmented (exponentially) by play-at-home arrangements. These sold quite well among curious enthusiasts in the days before recording and broadcast."},{"instruction":"Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?","output":"Elijah, people with listed degree awards longer than your name have been pondering that since the time of Socrates. Any answer from anyone -no matter about credentials - is a supposition. Mine is that Working for others means that one has agreed to do certain tasks for a specified payment. This working is a part of maintaining civilization and that is what we do in the norm to make civilization function. (Its good to remind oneself that without the maintenance of our industrial civilization, its back to slavery - as history has taught over and over.) Alas, no one does or can sign an agreement with oneself to do certain things because events happen in a stream interrupting our plans and we can not work around them. To visualize this in the extreme imagine a zebra on the Serengeti who started out to peacefully graze this morning while in the company of peers. The herd was enjoying lush green grass. But a hungry lion appears and the zebra’s plans are shot to hell as the prey and its peers focus on their escape. Finally, there are esoteric circumstances where devils and conflicts banging around in one’s head that prevent one from performing the planned and necessary daily tasks for oneself - but that is not a topic for a blog answer.

What will be the consequences?","output":"**Kya Hoga Agar 1 Rupee Dollar ke barabar hojaye?:-** Friends, many times this question must have come to your mind that **Kya Hoga Agar 1 Rupee Dollar ke barabar hojaye?** Today in this article we will talk about what will happen if one rupee becomes equal to one dollar. The first and most important thing is that if this happens then it will not mean that the economic system of our country is very strong. The day one rupee becomes equal to one dollar, India will suffer a lot. Those who know the economy say that if this happens even for just one day, then it will take years for India to make up for this loss. So let us know why this would happen. So let us know through an example that in 1986, the currency of Japan became very strong. Whose loss was so much that he has to suffer even in the year 2021? In 1986, overnight the dollar fell from 280 yen to 140 yen. Due to such a big change, there was such a big blow to the economy of Japan. The loss of which this country is still suffering today. **Why does the rupee weaken or strengthen?** The value of the rupee depends entirely on its demand and supply. This has an impact on imports and exports. **Kya Hoga Agar 1 Rupee Dollar ke barabar hojaye?** The day this happens, electronic goods, software, and all those goods that India buys from other countries will become very cheap. Because India will not have to pay 70 times to buy such goods. We can also buy branded things at cheap prices. Like the iPhone which sells at the highest prices in our country today, it will be available for only 1000 to 1500 rupees. Because the cost of the iPhone in America is only 1000 to 1500 dollars. **Kya Hoga Agar 1 Rupee Dollar ke barabar hojaye? (damage)** **Population and hunger will increase.** On the day when 1 became equal to one rupee, on the same day Indian laborers working abroad would leave their work and return to India. Soon India's population and unemployment will start increasing. Along with this, citizens of many other countries will also move to India, due to which the population will increase further. Frankly speaking, there will be money but learn to live and there will be no grain to eat. If one rupee becomes equal to one dollar, then the things we send to other countries will become expensive for them. So a lot of countries will stop buying stuff from our country. Because of this exporting will stop in our country. **Unemployment will increase.** All the call centers that run on the basis of IT companies in the USA, UK, and Canada will be closed. Because such a company gets work done in India at low prices and more than 70% of IT companies in India have call centers in their name. So you can imagine to what extent unemployment will increase. Simultaneously, money coming from abroad through IT companies will also stop. Even more important is that all this work will be handled by Pakistan again. **People will stop coming for tourism.** If the value of the rupee increases, then the tourists will also reduce their arrival. Because where earlier they used to find it cheap to travel in India, now they will find it very expensive. **Foreign investment will be done.** Foreign investment is mostly done in the IT and service sectors of our country. These sectors contribute 60% of the GDP of our country. 27% of the population of our country also get employment from these sectors. Which will be completely closed because foreign countries will stop investing in our country. **There will be a reduction in taxes.** Taxes will have a bad effect. This is because if there is no production in our country then no tax will come. Because of which the government will not even get money. It is because of this that the Reserve Bank of India has made some assumptions. Due to which the rupee is neither allowed to fall much nor is it allowed to rise much. Because in the presence of these two, somewhere India may have to suffer heavy loss. By the way, it is common for the dollar and rupee to go up and down, so RBI does not worry much about it. But even then, too much fluctuation in the dollar and rupee will not be good for our economy. Hope you liked this article. Thank you very much for reading this article.

The US at the time had a lot of gold, but not enough to exchange for all those dollars. The fear was that European investors would attempt to exchange all those dollars and thus remove all or almost all of our US gold reserves. That would make US dollars worthless. Nixon wisely closed the ‘gold window’. If these investors wanted to dump their dollars they would have to spend those dollars in the US for US manufactured goods.

Despite its commendable academic infrastructures, the country faces challenges in terms of educational diversity and student welfare. If you are eager to know what is wrong with the current education system in the United States, then invest some time in reading this blog for in-depth analysis and knowledge. 1. Cost of tuition is high This is one of the most alarming limitations when it comes to talking about the challenges faced by the education system in the United States. The cost of tuition is said to be high as compared to other countries. So much so, the tuition fees apparently go upward with 45-50,000 per year. If students need to spare such hefty amounts to support their tuition's, then how will they afford other expenses such as college fees, admission costs and the likes? 2. Teaching diversity is one alarming factor The courses in the education system in the United States are subjected to high diversity. This has resulted in each of the 50 states offering a substantially different syllabus and academic norms based on the same field of study. Now, this is creating discrepancies and gaps in teaching as contents tend to differ from one university to the other. 3. Limited employment opportunities for international students Apparently, the United States has certain immigration restrictions for the international students. This has led to complexities in terms of international students seeking admission in US universities and looking for employment opportunities post graduation. So, if we are to consider the factors as mentioned above, then it seems that the country is in some serious needs for revamping the way its government looks at education-based prospects."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

(However under the right conditions 50V can push enough current through your body to kill you). Walking across a carpet can generate 30,000V of static electricity. It’s good practice to leave a multi-meter on a high Voltage range when not in use. It’s the deliberate impurities that are added to silicon that make it into useful semiconductors. Some types of electric motor should never be operated without a load. Imaginary numbers are very useful when solving or analysing certain electrical or electronic problems.

But there IS something that I can attest works quite well, and is as close to “prediction” as you can get with current science - the MyShake app. We all carry a very sensitive instrument in our cell phones, an accelerometer. It has many uses, but if you opt in to the app, your cell phone accelerometer readings are combined with tens of thousands of others to produce a pretty sensitive shake detector. Cell phone systems are faster than earthquakes. In the event of a quake, the app sends a signal to cellphones in range of the detected quake to wake up a verbal Notification: “An earthquake has been detected. Take cover and hang on!” I had just installed the app on my cell phone and was awakened in the middle of the night. I did in fact take cover and hang on, and the earthquake was very noticeable - in a 30′ RV, mind you.

There will be adult style conversations about science, politics, and whatever else the child is interested in from when the child is about 8 years old. If you can offer them engaged discussions, extension materials, and interesting problems the child will grow up fine. When they are little they only try everything once - until they mastered it, then they want to move on to the next thing to learn which can be exhausting for the parent. Problems may arise if one of the parents - or both - are not on the same level as their child. The main danger is being sucked in by so-called experts who offer help with educating a high IQ child. If that expert is high IQ themselves (and I consider many - but not all - people from 120 onward as suitable) then things will be fine. However, if it’s just someone who is fascinated by the subject and is just average things can go horribly wrong. Problem is - people who are not highly intelligent themselves cannot distinguish between the real thing and wannabees. I have seen highly intelligent children ‘accelerated’ until they were on the 75th percentile for the age group they joined which led to one child attending university at age 14. Another started uni at age 7. The parents were paraded on TV and were super proud. Not sure what became of the child. Last thing I heard was they needed someone to write for them as they weren’t able to take notes themselves. Their fine motor skills just weren’t up to the task. I have never heard anything about this so-called ‘genius child’ - no big scholarships, no Maths Olympiad, no Bright Sparks Competition - nothing. Accelerating a child means taking them out of their comfort zone, making them a social loner - something they already are by definition. The theory I have heard is that a bright child may find peers in an older age group. This is just utter rubbish - unless there is an equally intelligent child in the new class who doesn’t mind being associated with a ‘baby’. If you’re a high IQ person and your child is, too, you don’t see anything special in them. They are your child, they are just normal - and a privilege to raise."},{"instruction":"What is the most foul smelling thing you found when cleaning out a room or closet in your house or garage?","output":"Dead fish in my daughter's pocket when she was about 10.

I know this from years of persona experience actually using an SSRI myself and also working with clients in therapy who were medicated with Anti depressants or other psychiatric medications. However, in some cases people do not have good responses to these drugs and should not use them. The usual way to learn about a specific person’s response is to try the drug. There may be tests for this also which I am not aware of. Anti depressant drugs are not generally dangerous but they do change your brain chemistry while you are using them and for many months after stopping using them. Suddenly stopping these drugs can be dangerous because the sudden withdrawal can cause deep depression. For a person with stubborn depression, it is foolish not to give these meds a try.

If you you are familiar with an M4 you want to use an M4 out of practicality. Special forces is completely different. Green Berets are often fighting with local forces they trained side by side with similar weapons. Direct Action units do use enemy weapons when they need to blend in with locals.

Travellers expecting Hollywood glitz and glamour were shocked to find what they called a run-down, dangerous and dirty urban sprawl. Many said it was concrete and “uninteresting”, believing there was little more to it than the tacky Hollywood Boulevard (with homeless people sleeping beside the Walk of Fame). One of the biggest gripes was the fact that great distances make it impossible to walk around, and that the public transport is poor, making much of the city inaccessible to non-drivers. 2/9 The Pyramids: ‘Stayed 15 minutes’ Egypt tops many a bucket list, particularly for the world-famous Pyramids of Giza. But you may think twice after you read reams of horror stories of stolen belongings and garbage-strewn streets. The wondrous pyramids themselves “can be seen from Pizza Hut”, and are so close to the city you cannot imagine them away from the noise and chaos, visitors said. Many said they were constantly harassed by locals trying to sell them things, and one said it was a “kick in the stomach” to find that the inside of the central chamber “looked like a cow shed.” 3/9 Stonehenge: ‘Very anticlimactic’ The ancient English monument is a major disappointment for tourists. It’s small, you can’t get very close to it, and it’s really not worth the rather long journey from London, many agreed. One commenter said his wife was back in the car before he had reached the second information board. Many were confused over what a “henge” even was, with one asking if it was “Latin for tourist trap”. An archaeology student pointed out that nearby Avebury Henge was much better — “bigger and you can walk right up to it.” 4/9 Paris: ‘Worst city on earth’ The French capital comes in for plenty of criticism from the naysayers, mainly thanks to the reported rudeness of the locals. While some said this was down to tourists’ failure to attempt the language, others called it a general air of superiority. “I couldn’t order a f***ing coffee, in English or in French, without a disdainful look from any cafe employee,” became a familiar story. Other accusations levelled at the city were that it was overpriced, dirty and “smelled of urine.” 5/9 Venice: ‘A gigantic tourist trap’ While Rome and Naples also got votes, picturesque Venice was most frustrating for visitors. Many thought it was sad to see how it had declined because of tourists, making it impossible to find affordable food and drink in central areas. “The famed canals are horribly polluted and filled with garbage,” said one visitor. Others said it was crowded and full of scammers, and worth a weekend visit at most. “Disneyland for middle aged American yuppies,” was the verdict. 6/9 Dubai: ‘Smoke and mirrors’ The UAE’s massive, expensive land of giant malls and skyscrapers hit the wrong note for many visitors. Tourists slammed it as “overpriced, superficial, fake and unfriendly”, with others left feeling empty at the lack of culture. Many hated the intense heat, coupled with scenery of “malls and slums”, while others objected to what they saw as a sexist culture. The large buildings were “cool to see for about 45 seconds. 7/9 Jamaica: ‘I will never go back’ Jamaica came up frequently for being full of opportunists looking for “tips” for doing nothing. Even beauty spots like the Duns River were dismissed as no more than “tourist traps”. Some found that local vendors were aggressive or hostile, and even said they felt physically threatened by people who were simply after their money. 8/9 Bali: ‘Every beach sucks’ Lucky for Australians, our country only came up a few times, with a couple of complaints about Uluru being dull and one black traveller saying they had “never felt more ostracized or aware of my skin colour”. But Aussies’ favourite holiday destination — Bali — was a crushing disappointment to visitors from further away. One said the infrastructure was so bad they wanted to “run away and hide” so as not to contribute to the “degradation of culture”. Others said Bali’s beaches were filthy, touristy and full of scammers; certainly not the paradise they had flown around the world to see. 9/9 And the rest... From Philadelphia to Florida, Tunisia to Turkey, the long list of shattered dreams shows that bad trip can really stick in your head. The over-hype of world-famous landmarks from Niagara Falls to Times Square to the Taj Mahal has inevitably left us asking: “Is that it?” Dirty streets, conmen and crowds of tourists were repeat offenders for ruining holidays, although the influx of visitors ruining popular resorts seems a self-fulfilling prophecy. Reassuringly, for every negative comment there was someone who loved a place, recommending off-the-beaten track secrets and nearby hidden gems."},{"instruction":"What are some unique startup ideas for India?","output":"Here are some startup ideas for India: EdTech: The Indian education sector is a massive market, and there is a growing demand for online education.

There are always some disadvantages such as cost and complexity. Before robots were installed in Kodak film manufacturing, I could specify the formula for a given film product in a two-page document. With a fully integrated robotized manufacturing facility there were about 70,000 fields that had to be specified in the computer system for one product. Not only did I have to specify the number of layers and the quantities for each ingredient in each layer, but I also had to specify the vessel that each layer used, the containers that were used to deliver each component, and the scheme for multiple containers (ex: two full bottles and one partial bottle or three partial bottles). It was crucial for the robot to know the container size to be picked up, de-capped, and poured into the kettle. If the formula called for a 2 L bottle and a 1 L bottle was delivered, it was dropped on the floor. If a 4 L bottle was delivered, the robot would squeeze it until it was the width of a 2 L bottle. Much of the liquid was now on the ceiling from the geyser that this produced. I also had to specify all of the tests to be done on each mix before it was delivered to the coating machine. The aims and tolerances had to be specified for each test. The corrective actions had to be specified to determine the remediation for any tests that failed the specs. Was this a huge piece of work for the people like me who specified the formulas? Hell yes. We spent weeks debugging formulas. Did it reduce errors in the long run? It sure did! I’m sure that modern robots with vision systems could recognize when the wrong size bottle was delivered. The vision system might be worthwhile, but it would be necessary to teach the robots what to look for. During this time a manufacturing guru came to Kodak to speak. (His name will be added when I can look it up.) His first rule of robots was: Before you install robots, do all the things necessary to allow robots to work. If you have consistent containers, consistent labels, and consistently open pathways for robots to work, human workers will demonstrate significant productivity increases. The additional cost to install robots may not always be justified."},{"instruction":"What is the easiest and best way to wake up in the morning?","output":"Go to bed early enough the night before that you wake up comfortably when the sun comes up - or use a sun lamp if you live somewhere that’s dark half the year like I do. Make sure you get everything you need for the next day before you go to bed so there are no worries on your mind that you can do anything about and put to rest any thoughts about stuff you can’t do that night. Aim for 8+ hours between your going to bed and sunrise and it will actually feel GOOD when the sunshine hits your face.. If you’re looking for a pick-me-up if you need some easy quick energy that is healthy, leave the caffeine alone and go for some cold smoked salmon if you can. Any fatty fish will do, but smoking it is important because it begins to break down the protein before it ever hits your stomach. Something well marinated or pickled or fermented would work just as well. A small amount of easy-to-digest protein & fat should be your best friend in the morning. I used to work out right after eating it and it won’t cramp you when you’re exerting yourself like some other things do.

Say you encrypt a text with a Vignere cipher by shifting each letter up by some fixed amount, say 3, then 5, then 18, then 7, and then repeat 3, 5, 18, and 7. I can decrypt this very simply by shifting down these same values. Say you encrypt a text by multiplying every three letters by some fixed matrix mod 26. I can decrypt this by multiplying by the inverse of the matrix mod 26. There are however, some operations that are hard to “invert”. At first it seems like modular exponentiation might be such an operation. If you encrypt x into y = x^e mod p, (p a prime) then decrypting this seems to require trying every x mod p to see which one turns into y. That takes O(p) steps, and if p is large, it will take too long. If, however, e and p-1 have no common factors, then you can decrypt y quickly, because (using Fermat’s Litte Theorem) it turns out that d^y = x mod p, where d is the inverse of e mod p-1. And, the operations of calcualting an inverse mod p-1 and doing a modular exponentation are all O(log p), i.e. very fast. You can throw a monkey wrench into the decryption by using pq instead of p, and using the inverse of e mod (p-1)(q-1). It all still works, but factoring pq, takes too long… So that the particular encryption, x^e mod pq, where e and (p-1)(q-1) have no common factors, is fast while decryption is slow. In general, not every mathematical function is easily inverted."},{"instruction":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","output":"Sir, I understand the need to monetize. I understand the need to expand your audience. I understand the need for competition. But there is something of an exchange between broadness of appeal and the ability to attract and retain specific groups. The broader the appeal of a site is, the less appealing it may be to specific groups. Over the last two years, just from a purely subjective point of view, I have been watching my feed change. When I joined in 2014, I could routinely find something new to learn. The questions (aside from feminism as a topic, which tends to attract people with issues) were generally well-written or easily corrected to be well-written, and could be usefully answered. I felt privileged to be a part of the website, and genuinely looked forward to growing my knowledge base through reading the material presented by experts in their fields. Since 2017 and especially since 2018, my feed has become increasingly filled with various violations of site policy ranging from polemics with a question mark to obvious violations of BNBR to increasing and incredible insincerity to absolutely stunning demonstrations of the inability to engage in reading comprehension. I have taken my duty as a member of the site seriously and I report the more obvious violations so that I can help clear the feed, but what was an occasional report has become a daily or near daily chore. The number of answers written by experts demonstrating expertise has slowed to a trickle, compared to a veritable slew of flaming illiterate garbage which cannot usefully be commented on, answered, or even edited to be useful. I’ve un-followed and had to repeatedly remove topics from my feed which were essentially an excuse for someone to post nude selfies, pictures stolen from various porn sites, and advertisements for adult or hacking services—if I wanted to be a part of a generic social media website or the open sewer that is most social networking sites, there are plenty of them on the internet for me to join that aren’t Quora. Part of the appeal here for me was a site for learning, particularly as someone who left academia but still loves to learn. I have zero desire to meet hot singles, to see nudes in my feed, to have hacking services advertised to me, or to see any of the same puerile political questions that are, once again, polemics with a question mark affixed to the end of it. I understand that some of this is inevitable to being more popular on the internet, but some of it is also the deliberate choice to widen the appeal of the site to a broader audience. I’m also not terribly fond of seeing the same low quality question posted by different people multiple times a day. I itch for a Stack Overflow type community policy so that I can ban-hammer people’s apparent inability to read the questions and answers that have already been posted. It is exhausting to keep seeing the same basic questions posted over and over in the same topics, and it is a strong disincentive to experts to keep writing in topics. I find myself increasingly thinking about migrating, and many of the experts I follow are complaining about the same. The search function could definitely be bettered, but I’m managing to find a lot of repetitious questions when I consider posting them, so I’m tempted to cite at least some of the repetition to general laziness and arrogance on the part of the person asking questions. One of the exchanges the site is making is to appeal to the broader public at the expense of the ability to retain or attract experts. The broader the appeal to the public, the less likely Quora is to have and keep the experts that can most usefully answer site questions. I don’t make the mistake of thinking I’m particularly important, but I have to tell you that about three times a week for the last year, I consider permanently leaving without fuss or much in the way of announcement. I’m starting to find answering questions here stressful not because I may be disagreed with, but because the quality of the feed, questions, and discussions in my comments are going down precipitously over time. And I doubt my leaving will make much difference one way or the other, but based on what I’ve read of other long time authors here, it’s not an uncommon sentiment. Assume I have the same complaints about the QPP as everyone else—I increasingly wonder if my participation in this site is a waste of time, since I can be tagged on the same very basic question as many times as anyone might wish without any hope of ever having actually helped anyone by answering a question. The same question continues to pop up over and over. Part of the incentive for writing answers is to help others learn, and the Sisyphean treadmill that is the QPP is discouraging when it isn’t depressing. Incentivizing it with money simply makes it more depressing: I know that the treadmill will continue. I also see, frequently multiple times a day, questions alleging a conspiracy against right wing members of Quora or anyone who happens to interact with moderation. I don’t know that this is the case, but I suspect there to be a dramatic upswing in those types of questions or comments of late, likely because people either aren’t reading the site terms (particularly with regard to BNBR) or because they don’t believe those terms will be enforced. While I’ve never had a bad interaction with moderation (thank you, moderation), I suspect from reading other answers on the topic that moderation is a bit overwhelmed or otherwise over tasked. I personally would not wish to be responsible for moderating this site, but something should likely be changed there. There’s no reasonable way to moderate truly large sites. The larger the site gets, the harder that problem becomes, but there are ways to disincentivize participation for people inclined to abuse the space, most of which involve not appealing to them in the first place. This is another of the exchanges that comes from a broader audience: it becomes impossible to stem the tide. I really like this site, despite my complaints—I like the reason it was founded, I like what I understand of the purpose, I like many of the people I’ve ‘met’ through Quora, I like learning things I did not know before. I do not, however, like the direction the site is taking. This is not, nor should it be, a social networking site. I probably will end up leaving if the site continues to become indistinguishable from a social networking site: I joined to ask and answer questions, and to learn new things. I did not join to watch the formation of a slightly geekier Facebook. Please, please don’t let it go there. Edited to add: Look, I know some of this is the difference between a particularly academic ethic of knowledge and participation and other ethics of knowledge and participation, but if the point is to provide a unique question and answer website, it might pay to default to a more academic ethic."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of arguments against the existence of an afterlife?","output":"It depends, I suppose, on your definition of death.

In this sense, it remains quite popular, particularly in urban areas around the world. The emphasis in such cases is on spontaneity, retaining a rough, unfinished feel to the finished product, embracing a sense of ragged, second-hand, repurposed style (ie “thrift-store chic”), and advancing some type of socio-political agenda. With this understanding, one could see that “punk rock” continues to remain popular in various forms like spoken word street poetry, visual art, culinary endeavors, social organizing, and yes, rock and roll bands. When someone turns a vacant building into an improvised art and performance space, that is punk rock. When someone organizes a group to protest income inequality (or some such social cause) and does so without a formal meeting space, agenda or even a consistent roster of members, yet manages to maintain a recognizable public presence of some sort, that is punk rock. When someone turns their garage into an impromptu restaurant featuring young, relatively inexperienced culinary staff and scraping together whatever local ingredients they can from unconventional suppliers, that is punk rock. When someone creates their own “radio station” with a bunch of past-its-sell-by-date equipment, a closet sized studio space in a corner of a repurposed warehouse, and an all volunteer staff of untrained broadcasters, that is punk rock. And of course, whenever a group of teenagers gathers to compose music with only rudimentary musical skills, performs in public, and makes recordings on a shoestring budget, that is still punk rock."},{"instruction":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","output":"Business analysts are professionals who help organizations improve their operations, make better decisions, and achieve their goals by analyzing data and identifying opportunities for improvement.

I'm barefoot most of my life so I like to ensure that my feet are clean and pretty, for women’s, men’s and my own pleasure. I enjoy it that my bare feet look attractive to others— hence the toe rings and ankles. However, being married, I'm not really in a position to paint my toes. I have done it before a few times — a couple of times for an ex girlfriend many years ago, and a few times for my ex boyfriends over the last five years. I find it sexy and it adds to my femininity. Plus, being the submissive bottom in a gay relationship, it turned my partners on so much that they could not stop fondling, massaging, licking and kissing my feet and sucking my toes, which drives me wild with lust. So, if I was ever in a serious, committed 24/7 gay relationship in the future, and identified myself as an open and out member of the gay community, then I might paint my toes sometimes — pink, red, blue and black being my favourite colours, but french pedicure probably being my favourite."},{"instruction":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","output":"What is Liposuction? 7 Types of Liposuction Surgeries Liposuction is a surgical procedure used to remove excess fat from specific areas of the body.

No, that's not enough. When Deepika posted the picture of Raw mangoes on her Instagram, the whole media started discussion about the same and end with a conclusion that she is Pregnant. Wow!!! Let's clap for our media for showing so relevant news on a daily bases. Now, let me show you some pictures and news which Indian media believes isn't relevant to be known :- What do you think after seeing this picture? This boy who is less than 3 years old is trying to wake up her dead mother in Muzafarpur station. But India media didn't pay any attention on this. Now meet this man, he is 80 year old Muzibola. He is a porter ( kuli) by profession. He is helping the poor passengers from the past 50 years continuously. And now when the situation are so worst for migrant workers, this man is doing the work of a God. He is giving food, milk, banana and some packet food to the migrants in Railway station. When a passenger asked him how much money did it cost? He replied:- Bhagwan ko mouh bhi dikhana h jaa kar. Agar aap s rupees liye to mera bhagwan mujhse naraz ho jayega ( I need to face God. If I take money from you then my God will be angry on me). In total, there are 892 news channels in India but not even a single media appreciated this man. Every other person is appreciating Sonu Sood as he is helping migrants to reach their home but what about people like him who are doing this work for years. No appreciation for them? Don't they even deserve to be known? I believe this man is the own person of God. And this doesn't end here. If you don't believe me then let me show you something These news anchors are spreading fake news to encourage religious differences and a gap between Hindu and Muslim. Open any news channel most of the time, either there is debate going on among the various politicians if not then news anchors mainly talk about Hindu and Muslim. Indian media shows the news that can catch the interest of people whereas they should show the news which are in the interest of people. I think Indian media and Reality can never go along."},{"instruction":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","output":"An ex-roommate in college bought a brand new Mitsubishi Eclipse turbo (this was back in 1992 or 1993). He loved to drive fast and gave me a spin to show me how quick it hit 60 (in a 25mph zone, no less). Not sure how he got the money as we were both full-time students at the time and he only had a part time job waiting tables. Anyway, a few weeks later he calls me to tell me he was driving it on the freeway late at night, the road was wide open, so he decided to see how fast he could get it. Says he got it up to something like 140mph before bringing it back to regular freeway speeds. He thought everything was fine but then a minute later a cop car comes speeding up behind him out of nowhere with lights flashing and pulls him over. They immediately arrested him for reckless driving and impounded his car. Turns out the cop didn’t even get him on radar, the cop just happened to be somewhere behind him on the freeway when he decided to floor it, and judged him to be going “well over 100mph” based on how fast his taillights were moving away. I’m not sure what ultimately happened with the case. This was in Washington state and speed alone is not enough to prove reckless driving, so I’m guessing he lawyered up and got it reduced, although I do recall him mentioning he got dropped by his insurance."},{"instruction":"Which university is better for BSCS in Lahore, Comsats or PUCIT?","output":"PUCIT is far better than comsats."},{"instruction":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible?","output":"Probably great screen density.

One mechanism for this is dissociation. When we dissociate, we split our mind and/or body into separate facets unconsciously. Dissociation usually begins during a traumatic event during which the brain is overwhelmed by what it is experiencing and therefore, to protect itself in the moment, it allows us to go to a sort of ‘happy place’. We may learn to visit this place in our mind during further distressing times. What can begin to happen is that we repress our trauma and fail to integrate it as a part of our story. From personal experience I can say that this works surprisingly long until the traumatic memories begin to resurface through our sub-conscious. For example, I’ll have nightmares and night terrors. One form of dissociation is a disconnect from one’s emotions, and especially the bodily responses associated with these emotions. For me, I just felt nearly all emotions as anger as it felt like it served me better than to spend time undercovering what I’m truly feeling. In this way dissociation is an adaptive mechanism to help us survive an overwhelming experience. Another typical emotion masking the shades of grey in our emotional life is anxiety. Nevertheless, this kind of coping mechanism develops slowly over time and isn’t something we choose consciously. It happens as a result of our brain rewiring its connections in response to our trauma. One great way to help undercover one’s emotions is to do so with the help of a therapist. I spent 1.5 years in therapy and it definitely helped me recognize my emotions better. I am much less angrier, albeit somewhat more anxious. It didn’t magically cure me but made the problem better for sure."},{"instruction":"Who is the best email campaign management vendor out there?","output":"Just for a quick data point.

Cats are solitary hunters, and larger body size can help them take down larger prey. Larger size also makes them more intimidating to other predators, which is important for their survival. As a result, natural selection has favored larger body size in many cat species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars. Dogs, on the other hand, have evolved to hunt and scavenge in packs. In this social context, cooperative behavior and intelligence are more important for survival than physical size. As a result, natural selection has favored traits such as loyalty, obedience, and the ability to work with others, rather than body size. Additionally, the environments in which dogs and cats evolved have also played a role in determining their size. For example, smaller dog breeds may have been selected for their ability to fit in small spaces, such as dens, to hunt or protect their owners, while larger dog breeds may have been selected for their strength and ability to guard livestock. In summary, the difference in size between big cats and dogs is due to a combination of evolutionary, ecological, and selective pressures that have favored different traits in each species."},{"instruction":"World War II, why did Stalin order that Moscow buildings be burned down, despite the freezing Russian winter?","output":"He didn’t he had buildings rigged with explosives to destroy Moscow in the event of the Germans capturing it"},{"instruction":"Am I paragender or demigender?

The “radical” income tax proposals by the - fairly fringe, by her party’s standards - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were mainstream in a large part of the post-WWII period, in America or Europe. In fact, for a significant part of the 1950s and 60s, the top income tax rate was over 90% (though with plenty of reductions) and JFK was pushing to decrease it to 70%. Her ideas about subsidized education aren’t that much out of place considering how expensive it has become over the last few decades; the push for Green energy is new, but remember, we know a lot more about climate change and the risks it poses today than our grandparents did. Where today’s Democrats well exceed their predecessors are issues such as LGBTQ rights and so on, but there are not inherently a left vs right issue, rather than authoritarian vs individualistic one.

Has anyone tried both softwares?","output":"Basecamp really should be called BasicCamp. It does not have much functionality. Is essentially just lists and comms. It makes great first impressions (nice clean UI) but once you put a lot of projects and tasks in it, it becomes cumbersome to find things and to filter views the way you want. In short, it does not scale well. Wrike is one of the best pieces of tech I've come across. It can operate at a simple level if you want that (Tasks, Subtasks, Folders (Projects), Subfolders etc.), but if you want proper Project Management with Gantt ('Timeline' view in Wrike), workload monitoring, great dashboards/metrics etc., Wrike is the best tool we have come across. It's also excellent on social/collaboration front. We have been using it for a couple of years now, after going through around 8 tools in the same category across (a fatiguing) 18 month period -- we tested in depth (i.e. actually used as operational tools, inputing lots of projects/tasks/data into them) Basecamp, TeamworkPM, Trello, Nozbe, AffinityLive, DropTask... we found that some of them were great as tools for individuals but not great for teamwork collaboration (including collaboration with contractors and clients). We also found that Project Management tools built for 'Project Managers' were too onerous, rigid and slow to use. Wrike hits the sweet spot of simplicity balanced with functionality. It's a crowded space (so many apps, and more entering each month it seems) and I'm aware of well-regarded tools like Asana and Podio (they are up there with Wrike in calibre), but Basecamp really is elementary school compared with grad school for proper tools like Wrike, Asana and Podio. One last observation on Wrike... their innovation rate is astounding. Every quarter the app gets better. They have recently released v3 of their API which enables a lot of automation and efficiency... e.g. we are setting it up so that when someone becomes a member (client) of ours via a sign-up/purchase via an Infusionsoft webform, that Folders and Tasks are automatically created in Wrike. That is mindblowingly efficient."},{"instruction":"Do people in Portugal and the United States know that the actor Carlton from the show “Fresh Prince” is ethnic Portuguese?","output":"Can you explain how come you make actor Carlton ETHNICALLY Portuguese?

However, there are some strategies that can help you reduce overall body fat, which may lead to a reduction in face fat as well. Here are some tips: Caloric deficit: Reducing your calorie intake and creating a caloric deficit can help you lose overall body fat, which may also result in a reduction of face fat. However, it's important to create a moderate caloric deficit and not to reduce your intake too drastically.Cardiovascular exercise: Cardio workouts can help you burn calories and improve your cardiovascular health, which can aid in overall weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise per week.Strength training: Resistance training can help you build muscle mass, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day.Balanced diet: Eating a balanced diet that is low in processed foods, added sugars, and unhealthy fats, and rich in whole foods, can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight.Facial exercises: While there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of facial exercises, some people believe that these exercises can help tone the muscles in the face and reduce facial fat. It's important to remember that facial fat may be influenced by factors such as genetics, age, and hormonal changes, and reducing it may not be possible for everyone.

When a client makes a request to access a resource on the Internet, the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client, and the response is sent back to the proxy server, which in turn sends it back to the client. One of the main reasons to use a proxy server is to improve security and privacy. By using a proxy server, the client's IP address is hidden from the destination server, and the destination server sees only the IP address of the proxy server. This can help to protect the client's identity and location from being tracked. Additionally, some proxy servers can filter content and block access to specific websites, which can be useful in environments where Internet usage needs to be restricted. There are several types of proxy servers, including: HTTP proxy: This type of proxy is used for web browsing and can only handle HTTP requests.HTTPS proxy: Similar to an HTTP proxy, but is used to handle secure HTTPS requests.SOCKS proxy: This type of proxy is more versatile and can handle a variety of protocols and applications. Overall, a proxy server can be a useful tool for improving security, privacy, and network performance, and can be used in a variety of settings including businesses, schools, and homes.

I was a candystriper or a volunteer for the hospital in other words. I was looking for my future career and I had to choose whether it would be Police or working in the medical field. I obviously chose the medical field as you can see I’m studying to be a doctor. Anyway, I worked as a volunteer for two hospitals. One, a smaller one and one, a large one with day hospital and ICU and much more. Had a Level II trauma center but had to give up that certification. The smaller one, volunteers worked admissions which means I often stood around in the Emergency Department and I would ask the person their name, what they are there for and so on and so forth. I would direct them to triage when they were called. The smaller hospital was servicing the Rural population of a community in North Carolina where the opioid epidemic had hit hard and unfortunately I was an addict myself when I was 12–13 and so, I knew the signs of an addict. The person, a 15 year old boy had traveled from a small town in North Carolina by bus, I believe he said and he was badly hurt. He said he was robbed and had a gun pointed to him. Standard procedure for assaults and whatnot was to call the police (in all hospitals I volunteered at) but I called the Sheriff and in this small county, they were pretty busy I guess as it was a while before they arrived (about an hour)…. meanwhile, the kid was triaged and called back soon enough. About thirty to forty minutes later. ER is dead, only three people in there as this was a Tuesday at 1 AM. I hear some shouting and I hear someone yelping. The doors leading to the ER rooms slam open and this kid comes running out with vials of medications and also blisterpacks of meds. He’s not really looking ahead of him only behind him so I take the chance to trip him. He ends up falling on the ground and thankfully none of the vials broke. The sheriff was by at that point finally arriving and had placed the kid in handcuffs and took him into custody. I believe he was released either into his mom's care or something. I didn’t really follow the case. But the hospital had a small pysch-ward (2–3 beds, managed by two pysch doctors one for day, one for night and four nurses) and a medium-sized ER. Anyway, someone left the small hospital pharmacy unattended. I’m not sure why or how but the kid had gotten into his ER room and snuck out and then snuck into the pharmacy which was quite open. He placed vials of Morphine, hydromorphone and blisterpacks of Adderall, Ambien, Haloperidol, and many other controlled substances along with some medications that didn’t really make sense to take. He took antibiotics in tablets and blister packs, anticonvulsants, allergy medications, steroids and other stuff. It was really weird. We just chalked it up to being him grabbing whatever he could that he thought was an narcotic. Some time later, the kid was back and apologized. While I don’t know what happened to the kid in the end. I know that his family was very addicted to all manner of prescription drugs and forced him to do this, unfortunately. The Big Hospital in which I was a volunteer had me working getting people flowers, helping hand out meals, etc. I was doing a lot of that stuff until someone requested that I bring a Sprite for someone. I thought that was a little odd since nobody is allowed a drink until the doctor has examined them. I asked who this was and verified that this was an correct order. They said it was “doctor so and so” and that it was okay. So, I left my area and got a sprite from the cafeteria for free explaining why. I went to the Emergency Room and I bought the sprite out and I asked the nurse doing admissions who “doctor so and so” ordered the sprite for? They said “there’s no doctor so and so as far as I know”. I figured it was another volunteer playing a joke on me. I go back to my assigned area, drink the sprite since nobody else was going to. I hear some grunting noises. I turn a corner to gawk/rubberneck and someone had stolen one of the volunteer radios and had a crowbar, trying to get into the medical supply room. While the medical supply room had a few medications, it did not contain narcotics as far as I know. The hospital pharmacy usually had that. I backed away, gave some distance stealthily since he had a deadly weapon and could easily crack my skull with that crowbar. I switched to the security frequency on the radio and asked for hospital security to come. They did, got him restrained and held him until the local police came and arrested him. Turns out the guy had passed by me when I was busy and saw the medical inventory room, got curious. Stole one of the volunteer radios that one of our elderly volunteers forgot to put up and lured me away from the area near the door and went to town on it once I was gone. So, that’s my two memories of what I’ve seen. I hope they bring you interest."},{"instruction":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","output":"Lower back pain can be extremely debilitating, and it's something that millions of people suffer from on a daily basis.

A lot of lawyers get this wrong on the bar exam. Judges don’t. You have “intent” whenever you take a voluntary action. His “motive” may have been to protect bystanders and exert control until law enforcement arrived, but your motives don’t matter at law. At law, you suffer any reasonable consequences of your actions. For example, I shoot a five-year old girl and my defence is “But your honor, I wasn’t trying to kill that little girl, I was shooting at the local drug dealer, and I only meant to wing him, not kill him”. Too bad. Intent literally follows the bullet, not the scope. Now, whether he’s guilty of manslaughter or murder, or nothing at all is up to a lot of other factors, but wrestling a person to the ground intentionally establishes intent no matter what his motives were. I mean, if he’s found guilty, it could be considered in sentencing, but not with respect to guilt. If it were me defending him, I would focus on defence of third parties, which is a valid defence, and focus on the fact that my client didn’t use a weapon or more force than was necessary in the circumstances.

Cryptocurrency arbitrage is profiting from simultaneously buying a cryptocurrency from an exchange and selling it on a different one with a slightly higher price.Arbitrage means capturing the profit opportunities stemming from the price differences between different markets for an asset. Assume an asset X is traded in two markets, market A and market B. If it is traded at 100 in marketplace A and 105 in marketplace B, one can enjoy a riskless 5% profit opportunity excluding transaction cost. To be able to profit from arbitrage trading in the cryptocurrency market, you should be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges. Also, you should be able to detect and catch the opportunities that appear for a very short period of time.

Old TVs had a 300 Ohm flat cable that modern FM radios, for which also have connectors for.

To be fair, though, even as late as when I studied physics, it was not uncommon to have Heisenberg explained as “when you measure the momentum, you perturb the position, and vice versa”. It wasn’t until Aspect did the experiments on Bell’s inequality in the mid-80s that the matter was settled. Indeed, I gave a presentation as a part of an undergraduate course on exactly his: how Bell and Aspect had proven, Bell in theory and Aspect with experimental verification, that a quantum particle does not even possess a position and a momentum until we measure it. What happens is that under some circumstances, a quantum object behaves as if it has a definite position, and under other circumstances, as if it has a definite momentum, and that there can be no circumstances where it has both at the same time. My professor was thrilled; this was not part of his everyday work and it was actually all news to him. What your thought experiment does is to try to measure both at the same time.

Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‘bouncy’ than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for.

Most workers delude themselves into thinking that the companies they work for actually care about them and will help them if they get a chance. The sad fact is in the end when we need them most, most companies will tell us to go fuck ourselves and will not be there to take care of our needs. The only person looking out for us is ourselves and if we can’t motivate ourselves to do that in the service of self then nobody else will bother to care what happens to us.

Most people don’t really have the resources to take care of huskies: they require a ton of exercise, lots of space, and lots of constant stimulation. Since most people live in the cities or suburbs and have 9–5 jobs, they just aren’t capable of giving that kind of dog what it needs to be happy and healthy. Unfortunately, they also are a very popular dog breed to adopt because they are extremely good looking dogs and sort of look like what most people think they want in a dog. Add to this the fact that, when understimulated, they can be downright dangerous (Huskies are one of the breeds genetically and temperamentally still closest to wolves), and you can see how many people come to regret to decision to acquire a Husky. There are also two other strong factors that influence this kind of regretful turnaround: the first is that Huskies hate heat. Much of the US is pretty warm, at least in summer, and Huskies will be fairly uncomfortable in most climates. Relatedly, Huskies are very difficult to groom properly. They have thick, multilayered guard hair coats that require constant brushing and frequent trimming. Most people have no time, money, and inclination to put up with all of this. In short, huskies are easy to adopt but hard to take care of, a combination which makes for a lot of jettisoned pups."},{"instruction":"Do you agree with environmentalists that keeping dogs or cats is bad for the environment as they leave a large carbon footprint?","output":"I don't no about the cat but I been told by several guys they rather be dead if they couldn't enjoy dog fun"},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"Starting to make money online with affiliate marketing requires careful planning and execution.

This initiative was approved by a majority of D.C. voters in a ballot measure. However, it's important to note that Initiative 71 did not establish a legal framework for the sale or commercial distribution of marijuana. The process behind this legalization was somewhat nuanced. Initiative 71 was able to move forward and become law due to the unique status of Washington, D.C. as the nation's capital. The district operates under a different set of legislative rules, which grants it limited autonomy in enacting local laws. While federal law prohibits the regulation and taxation of marijuana, the D.C. Council used this limited autonomy to pass Initiative 71, focusing on personal possession and cultivation rather than commercial sales. This allowed the district to navigate the legal complexities and effectively decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana within its jurisdiction.

While exercise is undoubtedly beneficial, there are numerous other factors that contribute to weight loss. By making simple yet effective changes to your lifestyle and eating habits, you can achieve noticeable results without sweating it out. The Role of Diet in Weight Loss Your diet plays a pivotal role in your weight loss journey. Focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and energy without excessive calories. Opt for whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Mindful Eating for Weight Management Mindful eating involves paying full attention to the act of eating, savoring each bite, and recognizing hunger and fullness cues. By eating slowly and consciously, you'll be less likely to overeat and more in tune with your body's needs. Quality Sleep and Weight Loss Believe it or not, sleep plays a significant role in weight management. Poor sleep can disrupt hormones related to hunger and appetite, leading to overeating. Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Hydration and Its Impact on Weight Staying hydrated can actually help with weight loss. Drinking water before meals can help control your appetite, making you feel fuller and ultimately consuming fewer calories. Stress Management and Its Connection to Weight Gain High-stress levels can lead to emotional eating and weight gain. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and yoga to manage your stress levels effectively. Metabolism Boosters for Effective Weight Loss Certain foods, such as green tea, chili peppers, and protein-rich sources, can give your metabolism a natural boost, aiding in weight loss. Incorporating Physical Activities into Daily Routine While this article focuses on ways to lose weight without traditional exercise, incorporating light physical activities like walking, taking the stairs, or doing household chores can contribute to your overall calorie expenditure. Portion Control and Plate Awareness Being mindful of portion sizes can prevent overeating. Use smaller plates, bowls, and utensils to help control portions and prevent consuming more calories than necessary. Choosing Nutrient-Dense Foods Opt for foods that offer more nutritional value per calorie. This includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. The Importance of Protein Intake Protein is not only important for muscle growth but also for boosting metabolism and promoting feelings of fullness. Include sources like lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts in your diet. Fiber-Rich Foods for satiation Fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes provide satiety, helping you feel full for longer periods and reducing overall calorie intake. Avoiding Processed Foods and Sugary Drinks Processed foods and sugary drinks are often high in empty calories and provide little nutritional value. Cutting back on these can significantly aid your weight loss efforts. Monitoring Progress and Staying Motivated Keep track of your progress, whether it's through measurements, photos, or journaling. Celebrate your successes and use any setbacks as motivation to continue your healthy lifestyle journey.

No."},{"instruction":"Who would win between Mr. Mxyzptlk (DC comic) and Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen)?","output":"The powers of Gojo are absolutely nothing compared to those of Mxyzptlk. Even a DC 5D hat is more powerful than Gojo. Not so long ago Mxyzptlk gave Calendar Man a 5D hat. And just the power that the hat gave him, was enough for him to do the highest level of reality warping. With the hat, Calendar Man could bypass the fictional reality he exists in. That's why he could punch Superman without breaking his hands, because the hat made it so his punches packed the strength he thought about. Calendar Man could even move from place to place, by moving from one panel in the page to another panel. The thing about Calendar Man is that he wasn't that smart, or he would've figured out that he could do much more with the hat. So this is just what a DC 5D hat can do, but Mxyzptlk power far surpasses even that. The powers of Mxyzptlk are only limited by imagination, meaning that all multiverse scale reality and concepts are things he can just unimagine or change completely. And now I'll show what would happen to the powers of Gojo, if he had to fight Mxyzptlk. Infinite = According to Gojo the Infinite is a neutral ability that generates an infinite amount of spaces between him and anyone or anything, trying to touch him. That means that he can only be touched by what he wants to touch him. Mxyzptlk power extends through infinite realities and dimensions. Infinity of space and time on a several multiverse scales means nothing to him. He could easily touch Gojo by just moving his hand through the panels in the page. Same as he could imagine a scissor cutting the page where Gojo his, killing Gojo immediately. Limitless = Grants Gojo near absolute control over space, by manipulating it on an atomic scale. But to Mxyzptlk, anything below imagination is his to control as he wants to. Because space, time, matter, energy, dimensions, even life and death are just concepts. And he can imagine those concepts as he wants to, same as he can unimagine them and destroy them. And when Gojo tried to use Limitless, he would find that he couldn't do anything Mxyzptlk didn't allow him to do. Tobari (Curtain) = This technique that creates barriers would be useless against Mxyzptlk, because space means nothing to him. And so he can just appear wherever he wants to. Muryōkūsho (Ultimate Void) = Gojo's domain expansion, that creates a metaphysical space where Gojo will is absolute. Would fall apart facing the might of Mxyzptlk. Metaphysical space or not, again it's space and any kind of space is just a concept to Mxyzptlk. One he can manipulate as he wants to, or just unimagine it out of existence. Gojo simply can't fight Mxyzptlk powers of imagination, where he could create a reality of any kind so complex that Gojo would be trapped or completely powerless there. The thing about Mxyzptlk is that something like Cursed Energy would also just be a concept to him, and if he just tossed it away or erased it completely then Gojo would have no energy to power his abilities and techniques. This of course reduces the ability Six Eyes to nothing at all. Because although it has been hinted that Six Eyes allows Gojo to reduce his consumption of Cursed Energy to almost nothing, Mxyzptlk could just remove or erase all the Cursed Energy in Gojo. To fight Mxyzptlk is to fight a being whose powers are imagination itself. That means that anything below imagination is Mxyzptlk playground. The only thing the powers of Mxyzptlk can't affect at all is the impossible, also known as the 6th existential dimension of the DC Verse. And his only weakness is a dimension specifically made to cut him off from the 5th dimension. Both of which are beyond Gojo powers to do. And so Gojo chances of winning against Mxyzptlk are zero."},{"instruction":"What was your strangest holiday gift that left you shaking your head?","output":"One year (back in the 80s) a couple, who was a good friend of our extended family and almost considered family themselves, gave me a Chia pet for Christmas.

Being in a relationship at your age is pretty much a waste of time because only about two percent of high school sweethearts who marry end up having a fifty-year marriage (that's only 2 out of 100 couples). My recommendation is that you don't group date until you're a freshman in high school and that you don't one-on-one date until you're a junior in high school. If you decide to date one day, may I suggest that the first question to ask yourself when considering whether or not to date someone is, “Is this person a strong person?” If they’re not, no matter how much you like them, how much they like you, or how “cute” or “hot” they are, - please don’t date them. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you’re not already) and eventually look for this type of person (otherwise you’re setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately, this type of person is difficult to find – but save yourself the heartache and don’t settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS The best way to get to know a strong person without dating is to participate in the activities of a community service or a school organization."},{"instruction":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

Sense of Smell: Cats have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell, and the aroma of food plays a significant role in their appetite. If a particular brand's scent doesn't appeal to them, they may be less likely to eat it. 2. Texture and Consistency: Cats can have preferences for certain textures and consistencies. Some may prefer crunchy kibble, while others might prefer a softer texture. If the texture doesn't match their preference, they may avoid the food. 3. Previous Experiences: Cats may have had positive or negative experiences with certain foods in the past. If they've enjoyed a particular brand or flavor before, they may be more inclined to stick with it. 4. Taste: Just like with humans, cats have individual taste preferences. Some cats may simply not enjoy the taste of certain brands or ingredients. 5. Sensitivities or Allergies: Cats can develop sensitivities or allergies to specific ingredients. If a cat experiences digestive issues or discomfort after eating a certain brand, they may avoid it. 6. Environmental Factors: Stress, changes in environment, or the presence of other animals can affect a cat's appetite and willingness to eat certain foods. 7. Routine and Familiarity: Cats are creatures of habit and may become accustomed to a particular brand or flavor. Introducing a new food might disrupt their routine and lead to reluctance. 8. Palate Fatigue: Cats may get tired of eating the same food over and over. Introducing variety to their diet can prevent palate fatigue. 9. Packaging or Presentation: Cats are known to be visually oriented. The appearance and presentation of the food, as well as the shape of the kibble, can influence their choice. It's important to note that individual cats vary widely in their preferences. If you're trying to switch your cat's dry food brand, consider doing so gradually by mixing the new food with their current food. If your cat's pickiness persists or if they show signs of distress or health issues, it's recommended to consult with a veterinarian to rule out any underlying problems.

Galaxies rotate much faster than they otherwise considering the amount of mass all the baryonic matter they contain, yet galaxies are held together without stars being flung away from them. There are only scientific hypotheses and theories as to what it is and of what it is made. What would the purpose in making something that may already exists in an immeasurable abundance and serves a natural function? That's like asking if more crust of the earth can be made. That would be impractical. My theory is that dark matter is a form of antimatter that is located in parallel extra dimensions of the fabric of space just beyond the barrier to 4D space. It may be made of quantum antiparticles. The mass of dark matter particles affects the fabric of space although it does not exist in 4D space, just as the tectonic plates affect the top soil although beneath it. If dark matter existed in 4D space and is antimatter galaxies would not exist because of the mutual annihilation effect when baryonic matter comes in contact with antimatter. This is just one theory and would answer where antimatter went and is."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"As of 2016, the cleavage between The Conservatives and Labour in The UK is centred on ONE issue, Brexit.

However, people are also told that the Appalachians are formed by folding, and that’s the key. These are not so much mountains as long, steep, ridges. Their length is often in the tens of miles, and sometimes over a hundred. To go around something that long in a wagon would take days. To go up and over them was impossible before internal combustion engines (this was a huge impediment to the railroads getting through for the first in the mid 19th century). Even today, the automobile highway through that area goes through a tunnel, rather than through the Cumberland Gap itself.

Certainly not an alcoholic, I could go on holiday and not drink for weeks but as soon as I got home, I’d be at it again. Even my husband noticed, and the kids. So I looked for something else. The stress I’ve had over the last few year has been horrible, and so I took up vaping, and it’s really really helped. I just don’t drink from one week to the next and when I do, it really is just one drink. Vaping has taken away the desire for alcohol. Maybe it’s the flavours. I just love trying a new one, I love the little gadgets, the smells and chasing the biggest clouds. I love everything about it, and won’t be stopping anytime soon."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"This answer is limited to looking for Lord Shiva in the Veda, specifically the Veda Samhita. Upanishads and Purana are not incuded in scope. In my answer below I have proposed that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Veda. Most of the of the occurrences of the word “shiva” (and it’s vibhakti variants) in the Veda are references (as an adjective meaning auspicious) to Rudra who has been equated with Lord Shiva in Puranic literature composed 500 to 1000 years after the Veda. In a few occurrences the word shiva refers (again as an adjective meaning auspicious) to other deities and sometimes even non-living items such as soma (wine) and wood-sap. My answer is limited to this. My answer is not meant to support any ideas or claims that Lord Shiva is in any way less important, less respected, less powerful, less ancient, less holy than Lord Krishna or any other god/s. I am making this clarification for two reasons. Firstly, in the comments section some Quorans with very high intellect have mis-interpreted my answer and accused me of propagating ISKON doctrine. Secondly, Other Quorans , also of very high intellect have brought in all kind of arguments sourced from the Purana and TV serials to “prove” that Lord Shiva is supreme and therefore he MUST be in the Veda ( fantastic example of circular logic) . As I said, my answer is not about who is supreme or who is not. My answer is whether Lord Shiva is mentioned specifically the Veda..no need to get Purana and TV serials into the discussion. So before you jump into a discussion by writing a comment, keep this introduction in mind especially if you think yourself a “budhimaaan” or depend on TV serials for knowledge of the scriptures) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Yes , Lord Shiva (as known to us today) does not appear in the Vedas. The word SHIVA does indeed appear many time in the VEDA but mostly as an adjective for Rudra. It is important not to confuse the word shiva (adjective) with Lord Shiva (proper noun) A god / deity by name Rudra appears in the Veda. Actually the Veda mention 11 Rudra. There is a widespread belief that Rudra and Lord Shiva are one and the same . This belief has come about because in several places the word “shiva” has been used to describe Rudra. However this belief is incorrect because is not founded on a proper interpretation of the Veda. Rudra is an important Vedic god. Several hymns are dedicated to him in Rig Veda. He is described as an angry, roaring/ howling god, associated with winds and storms, destructive power, wild, red-coloured, etc. In fact, in modern hindi/ sanskrit, the word Rudra also means angry/ crying/ howling . The word shiva (an adjective meaning Auspicious in Vedic Sanskrit) appears in many places in the Veda. It is used in connection with many gods (and non-gods, animals, etc) in the Vedas. Among others it s most frequently used in the Rig Veda to describe Rudra. Since Rudra is wild and angry, he needs to be “calmed down” by calling him auspicious..shiva. Remember the phrase Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram ?..here shivam is referring to the adjective auspicious and not Lord Shiva. This phrase does not make any grammatical sense if the word shiva is taken to mean Lord Shiva. Try the translation yourself A. if the word shiva means Lord Shiva>> (that which is) Truth, Lord Shiva, Beautiful B. if the word shiva means auspicious >> (that which is) Truth, Auspicious , Beauitiful. Which translation makes more sense ? Further, in just one mandala (chapter 10) of the Rig Veda, the word Shiva/ shivam appears 13 times and is used as an adjective for Agni/ cattle/ dove/ wood-juice etc. See this link [LINKED_TEXT: Rudra in RV] [URL: https://randombydesign.quora.com/Rudra-in-RV]. The same scenario is repeated in the rest of the Vedas. Shiva , the word, appears dozens of times, mostly (but not exclusively) in association with Rudra. For people who are too lazy to refer the link, I am copying three of the shloka below. Therefore , just the fact that the word Shiva is used in the Veda as an adjective for Rudra, does not lead to the conclusion that Rudra IS the same as lord Shiva, because the same word is also used for many other deities. It is also important to note that Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikeya , all of whom are so intimately associated with Lord Shiva , do not appear anywhere in the Veda. In the comments section several people have quoted many shloka from the Satrudriya / Namakam/ Chamakam where the word shiva occurs frequently. But as explained earlier, it is an adjective used for Rudra and is not referring to Lord Shiva. So how do we resolve this issue whether the use of the word shiva is an adjective for Rudra, or it is a proper noun referring to Lord Shiva ? In the absence of Aadhaar cards, there are 2 tests we can apply to decide if the word shiva in the Veda is referring to Lord Shiva (ie it is used a proper noun) or is it used as a compliment to (mainly) Rudra and others (ie is it an adjective ?) A. Does the word directly address Lord Shiva as in “O Shiva, the mighty one, we pray to you.” There is no such occurrence in the Veda. None of the multiple examples of the word shiva cited in various comments have this direct address. B. Is the word used EXCLUSIVELY for a deity (in this case Rudra) ? This again is not the case. As elaborated in the answer (and the link provided for the 10th mandala of RV), the word is mainly used for Rudra, but also used for dove, wood-juice and cattle. An example from the Mahabharat is relevant here. Lord Krishna is sometimes addressed and referred to as Madhusudan (slayer of Madhu) or Parthasarathi (charioteer of Arjun) . These are not his original names. They are adjectives used to describe Lord Krishna, but these words are used EXCLUSIVELY for him. No one else is referred to by these two words and therefore they become proxy names (synonyms) for Lord Krishna. This is not true for the word shiva, because as explained earlier it is not used exclusively for any deity. Therefore the proposition that the word shiva in the Veda is referring to Lord Shiva fails both the tests. Another way of looking at it: In recent times (say last 300 years), Lord Shiva is one of the two most important deities, the other being Vishnu. In fact according to some traditions Lord Shiva is considered THE most important and referred as MAHAdeva. Now in the RIg Veda, Indra has the largest number of hymns dedicated to him (289). In comparison Vishnu has 6 and Rudra has 5. If the composers of the Veda thought that Shiva and Rudra were the same deity (with 2 nalmes) why would they place Rudra/ Shiva so low in importance ?

Origin of Shiva Linga as explained by Shiva Purana (Kotirudra Samhita - Chapter 12) I know Lazy people always come up with this “misguided” translation “by corrupted foreigners” argument. So let me tell you, the translaton is from a book edited by Pt JL Shastri renowned sanskrit scholar and published by Motilal Banarsi Das who are a most reputed publisher of Indian scriptures and translations. See ref url below. Shiv Puran Part III, Page 244 - 245. Some people have written answers to suggest that the Shivalinga never had a phallic origin. I have a few questions for them. If the Shivalinga is not a phallic symbol A. Why is the Shivalinga also always accompanied by a yoni ? B. Why were the older shivalingas such accurate images of the phallus.? .. (as can be seen in the pictures in Ishita Roys answer ). The same is true of the Shivalinga in the kamakhya temple in Assam. C. If the Shivalinga was meant to be just a “chinha” (sign) of Shiva , why was this specific form chosen ? Why not his trishul/ trident or numerous other symbols associated with Shiva ? D. If “chinha” is a synonym for Linga, why do we not call it Shivachinha ? E. Where else in ancient Indian religious texts is the word Lingam” used to refer to a chinha / mark ? F. The symbol for the question-mark “?”, is called prashna-chinha in Sanskrit and Hindi. Why don’ we call it prashna-linga ? I am not aware of any of my Islamic brothers having spread any rumours. The problem seems to be more with my Hindu brothers (and sisters) who for some unknown reason are so defensive on this issue that they put forward all kind of unsupported arguments. Further , if as pointed out by you, numerous older cultures had phallic symbols, what is wrong with the Shivalinga being earlier a phallic symbol that later transformed to something else ? Finally this forced connection in equating the sanskrit word “linga” with a chinha .. is it a part of your original thinking or have you copy/ pasted it from somewhere. ? To me it is very clear that the shivalinga (with the accompanying yoni) originated as a symbol of creation and fertility. It might not have been a part of the Vedic culture to begin with and likely had a tribal/ non-Vedic origin. When Shiva (who himself is a non-Vedic god) was later absorbed into the Vedic culture, the shivalinga was also absorbed and over a period of time its concept transformed from a simple phallic symbol to the more cerebral “pillar of the universe”.

It is named after Rudra, not Lord Shiva.· Similarly some invocations are from Rudraprasna , again named after Rudra and not Lord Shiva.· It is also important to note that Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikeya , all of whom are so intimately associated with Lord Shiva , do not appear anywhere in the Veda. · · The same is true for the adjectives Neelakantha, Tryambak etc. In the Veda they are referring to Rudra, though in the Purana (composed about a 1000 years ) they are used for Lord Shiva. It is this Puranic identification of Neelakantha and Tryambak with Lord Shiva that causes the confusion. Because of the dominance of Puranic narrative, we are so indoctrinated to identifying neelakantha with Lord Shiva that we cannot see another explanation with an open mind. · We also have a good understanding of why this Puranic identification of Shiva with Rudra took place. Lord Rama , Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were important historical personalities. In order that the Vedic Vishnu have a greater influence, the story of Vishnu’s avatars was created (in the Purana) and Rama, Krishna and Buddha were co-opted in the Vaishnav cult as avatars of Vishnu. But Shiva was a god (not a mere king) in the pre-vedic times of ancient India. He was too important to be co-opted as an avatar. So he was equated with an important Vedic deity, namely Rudra. Why the Purana composers chose Rudra and not some other Vedic deity (such as Vayu, Varun ec) is something that I have not been able to work out yet. This brings us to the question if Lord Shiva did not originate from the Veda, where did he come from? Well, the scholarly opinion is that the god we know as Shiva today is a pre-Vedic god, possibly from the Indus Valley Civilisation, or maybe a tribal deity. After the Vedic Indians had established their culture and religion in the north-west of India (Punjab, Kashmir, Haryana), by 1,000 BC, they moved eastwards and southwards. Here they encountered other Indian communities who followed a different culture and had their own gods. An assimilation of this local non-Vedic population and culture took place. This process is also referred to sometimes as Sankritisation. Shiva was an important god (perhaps the most important) for these non-vedic people, though we cannot be sure if the non-Vedic people also called him by the same name of Shiva. In order to assimilate Shiva into the Vedic fold, the Vedic people equated him with Rudra. Thus what was an adjective also became a name for a god.

Please also see [LINKED_TEXT: Ajay Joshi · 11moWhat are the strongest evidences that suggest the battle of Mahabharata actually happened?My answer to this question is among my top 3 viewed answers. Over a period of time , based on comments received, a number of edits have been added. I am now (in April 2021) completely re-writing this answer to give it greater focus while retaining nearly all of the information in the original. The original answer is also being retained. Remember, this is an answer on the historicity of the MB. It is not a criticism on the teaching of the MB or the philosophy of the Geeta. As far as I am concerned, both are vitally important, irrespective of whether the MB is a story or Itihaas. Before jumping in with a comment , keep this in mind. (In answering this question I will concentrate on the MB War , rather than the whole MB story. Also my view is that the MB war is fictional. It is a dramatised retelling of a much smaller war which is mentioned in the Rig Veda, namely the Dasranjana (RV, 7th Mandala) , or Battle of Ten Kings, abbreviated to BTK. Since my view point is that the MB war is fictional, I will obviously NOT be presenting any proofs supporting it’s historicity. The thrust of my answer will be to establish that the various proofs/ evidences etc put forward to prove that the MB war is historical, are not supported by sound logic.) In the absence of eye witnesses and CC TV, how does one establish an incident (ancient, or even a modern incident) has taken , or not taken place ? It is done by using circumstantial evidence. In the case of events which are ancient in nature, this evidence comes in the form of : A. Material evidence (unearthed through archeology). In the case of a battle, it would be skeletal remains, weapons etc. No such evidence has been found in or around Kurukshetra which is the scene of the MB war. * An interesting aside: The Indus valley Civilisation became widely known only after excavations in 1920. No one had even dreamt of it before then. According to carbon dating, the IVC started around 6000 BCE and was at its peak in the period 3500 to 2500 BCE. Funniy, there are no references to it in the Veda, Purana or the Itihaas epics. It is important to note that if we were to accept everything mentioned in the MB about the war as true, we are looking at very intense war in which 40 lac plus soldiers (and their weapons and horses and elephants) took part and again if we go by the Mahabharata book, they were all (except a handful) dead in the 18 day war. Where are the skeletal remains and weapons of that humongous army? So right at this point we have 2 options. Either the MB has greatly exaggerated the numbers or the MB war never took place. B. Contemporary records. For example the history of the Mauryan Empire has been re-created by looking at records kept by Greek Historians and Buddhist literature composed shortly after the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. But what about events that occurred before writing was invented? No contemporary records would be available. This is the case with the Mahabharat war. The date of the supposed MB war has been estimated by various scholars and researchers (see Note 1 below) from 5000 BCE to 850 BCE. A date of 3000 to 3100 BCE is very popular, as it coincides (according to the same people) with the beginning of Kaliyug/ death of Lord Krishna. So, even if we take the most recent date of 850 BCE, it supposedly happened AT LEAST 400 years before the first writing/ script (Brahmi) was seen in India. The only available record from a period not too far from the event is the MB story itself. There is no other record. Obviously we cannot accept the story’s own testimony of the MB war as a valid proof of historicity. Therefore, the MB war fails to be “historic” on both counts. It must be noted that the MB war is not the only such deemed historic event that cannot be supported by evidence. Every ancient culture across the world has some events like this. To use a familiar example, the parting of the Red Sea by Moses is mentioned in the Bible and believed by many to be true although there is absolutely no evidence available. This belief is based on the authority of the scripture (Bible), not on evidence. We will see more of this ‘authority of the scripture’ later. Note 1: Setting a date for the MB war has attracted the interest of a number of scholars/ researchers. These can be divided into 2 categories. Professional historians and archaeologists and Polemicists who have an interest in the subject. These Polemicists are usually qualified in diverse other fields such as Engineering, Medicine, Physics, Management, etc. It is interesting to note that the bulk of the Polemicists prefer a date of 3000 to 3100 BCE whereas professional historians prefer a date between 1500 and 800 BCE. Let me now deal with the various proofs / evidences that have been offered by various people. Many other answers to this question on Quora have referred to them. * ·The MB mentions many cities and regions which exist even today eg Kurukshetra, Indraprastha, Hastinapur etc. Since the cities mentioned in the MB exist, the MB must also be true. This logic is offered as the trump-card of proofs but it is the easiest to disprove. We have heard of the story / TV serials of Spiderman / Shaktiman (DD TV Serial). These stories refer to New York and Delhi both of which exist in the present day. Does that make the Spiderman/ Shaktiman stories true ? The same logic applies to Dwarka , where submerged ruins (dating 1500 BCE) have been found. So just because a few existing places ( or verifiable facts) are mentioned in a story, the whole story does not become a true story. * ·MB is classified as Itihaas. This is the ‘authority of scripture’ argument, mentioned earlier. Because some ancient scripture has called MB ‘itihaas” it MUST be true. No one, however has been able to say precisely where the MB is mentioned as Itihaas. In a similar way, the Veda are classified as Shruti although this classification is not appearing anywhere in the Veda itself. * * There has been just one comment saying that the MB is mentioned as Itihaas in the Satapha Brahmana. But here is the interesting thing. In the MB itself , Rishi Yajnavalkya is quoted as saying that he compiled the Satapatha Brahmana . (Mahabharata, Book 12: Shanti Parva: Section CCCXIX) . So obviously , the Satapatha Brahmana was composed BEOFRE the MB. By extending this logic, we are led to believe that the MB war was already Itihaas even BEFORE it occurred . Like tomorrow’s news yesterday. * · High levels of Radioactivity in Jodhpur (Raj). For several reasons this is one of the most ridiculous arguments. * * According to the same people who use this argument, the MB war took place in Kurukshetra. So why don’t we see radioactivity in Kurukshetra? Why in Jodhpur which is 650 km away and no where else in between ? So the radioactivity claim as proof of the MB war can be true ONLY IF ALL THE NUCLER WEAPONS used in the war were detonated in the wrong place. * * That is not all. On the entire internet there is not even one original source of this claim. One website has repeated the original, and that has been called out as fake. All the others references are copy/ paste from this fake claim. Many are copy/paste of copy/paste. The links are here Investigation : Defusing India's Ancient Atomic Blasts Source https://rense.com/general3/8000.htm . This is a website that promotes conspiracy theories. * * Finally. I lived in Jodhpur for 5 years as a student. I have been constantly in touch with my Jodhpur class mates for the last 35 years. No one has ever mentioned this alleged radioactivity. * * The Jodhpur radioactivity is an example where a fake claim has taken a life of it’s own because hundreds of idiots have copy/ pasted it on multiple websites. * · Fantastic science and weaponry. No surviving technology /evidence is available so we can attribute these to the creativity and imagination of the author/s of the MB. Two points to be noted. * * If the advanced science and weapons of the MB are indeed true, why did they not have simpler stuff like electricity and piped water ? * * * A point has been raised in a comment that it is possible to have advanced technologies without necessarily first having simpler ones. Science (at least for us humans) does not have the ability to leapfrog. Computers are based on silicon chips. manufacturing silicon chips requires machines and processes that were not available till 60’s. So science builds upon itself. Each discovery spawns new discoveries and better tools for more sophisticated research which leads to further discoveries. It is irrational to think that we could have rocket propulsion and space exploration using steam power. Or that we could have jumped from early landline telephones to smart phones without the intermediate development of silicon chips. * * * Another answer on Quora has mentioned an interesting view. If the 100 Kauravs could have been born using in-vitro technology, why could it not have also been used for several other MB couples who were childless ? FOr example Kuntibhoja (who adopted Kunti) and Pandu/ Kunti/ Madri. * * Even if the claims are not true and just imagination (poetic license), the MB could still be true, but only if we have other evidence that stands up to scrutiny. Unfortunately there is no such evidence. * * Please also see my example of Isaac Asimov in the original answer. * ·Astronomy. Several people have used astronomical events mentioned in the MB story to calculate the date of the MB war and as mentioned earlier, a date of 3000 to 3100 BCE is very popular. These people have used computers and software to calculate the dates. Now the interesting thing is that a lot of the general public and gullible Quorans are willing to believe the dates ONLY BECAUSE modern technology (computer/ software) has been used for the calculation. However the fixing of a date using astronomical events (with or without computers) has several flaws. * * The biggest flaw is that the references are internal. This does not constitute evidence. It comes from ‘authority of scripture’ and thus is not sufficient to prove that MB is a historic event. What it DOES tell us though, that at the time of the composition of the MB, the author/s (or their associates) had a good knowledge of astronomy. * * * While on the matter of dating the war : If internal references are acceptable, there is adequate support that the war did not take place before 1200 to 1300 BCE. The MB has multiple references to the use of Iron. One of them is below; Sabha Parva, Dhyut Parva, Shloka 29 ( I have deleted the original Sanskrit shloka as Quora does not allow Sanskrit in English language answers. It can now be seen in a cooment posted by me on 5 Sept 2022.) * * Yudhishthira said,--'I have four hundred Nidis (jewels of great value) encased in sheets of copper and iron. Each one of them is equal to five draunikas of the costliest and purest leaf gold of the Jatarupa kind. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee.'\\"Yudhishthira said,--'I have four hundred Nidis (jewels of great value) encased in sheets of copper and iron. Each one of them is equal to five draunikas of the costliest and purest leaf gold of the Jatarupa kind. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee.'\\" * * * It has been well-established by archaeology that the use of Iron in India for rudimentary items started only after 1300 BCE. Therefore the internal mention of Iron is the MB supports the conclusion that the events mentioned are NOT BEFORE 1300 BCE. * Most of the polemicists have relied on the Puranic idea of the start Kaliyug which according to the Purana happens shortly after the MB war. This Puranic concept of 4 yuga is highly debatable. The 4 yuga do not find any mention in the Veda. It is a kind of motivated retro-fit to accommodate important historical personalities/ deities (Lord Rama , Lord Krishna ,Lord Buddha) into the Puranic stories as avatars of Lord Vishnu. So any calculation/ evidence based on a flawed underlying basis cannot be considered with seriousness. * * Because of the heavy reliance of the Yuga concept several polemicists have ignored earlier and later occurrences of the same astronomical events ( I will add the details later).. here are the details So that covers all of the popular proofs/ evidences. The readers can make their own conclusions if the MB war is historic or not. Some readers have come up with a question. If it is all imaginary, what was the reason / inspiration for the creation of a story with such a wide canvas and such profound philosophy? I will answer that question in a few weeks’ time. Part 2 The Rig Veda tells of a war/ battle called BTK or the Battle of 10 kings (Dasarajana ,RV, 7th Mandala) . MB war (and basic plot of MB) has a number of striking similarities this Rig Vedic narration. I have summarised the relevant points below: Now what we know from scholars in the field is that the Rig Veda was composed BEFORE the Mahabharata. From the above comparison chart it is clear to me that the MB war story (and the MB book) is inspired by the BTK. The similarities are too strong for any other conclusion. But what is the proof that the BTK is real? Well, there is no archaeological proof at all. The Rig Veda is by far the oldest surviving composition of ancient India. The general consensus amongst scholars / historians is that the kings mentioned in the RIg Veda actually existed. Beyond that one can only apply logic and judgment to decide. A number of Kings mentioned in the MB also appear in the RiG veda. A partial list is below. (This is not a full genealogy/ father-son list, but the chronology is consistent.) It now becomes clear that the MB story was woven around the Rig Vedic kings with BTK as the main >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Original answer This question is about the evidence (ie verifiable, credible research) on MB having actually happened. It is not about faith/belief, philosophy or ancient tradition. Therefore please avoid comments on the teachings/ philosophy in MB/ Bhagwad Gita. The basic plot of the Mahabharata is taken from the Rig Vedic “Battle of Ten Kings”. The author/s of MB have used this event and added ideas from the RIg Veda along with some very creative writing. This event (BTK) has been dated by scholars to be between 14 to 10th C BC. This was a battle involving various tribes including the Bharata tribe. The winners were the Bharat tribe. Hence the name Mahabharata. Ref Battle of the Ten Kings - Wikipedia, Mahabharata Historicity by Prof. B B Lal https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/download/782/769 The rest of it, is a romantic/ dramatic fictionalisation.. in modern times we see similar films under the genre “historical drama”. As, historical dramas go, the Mahabharat also provides us rich information on prevailing kingdoms/ geography and society/ culture , class/ caste divisons. But the stories of fantastic weapons, humongous armies, superheroes , re-births and re-incarnations, advanced technology (nuclear, cloning/ surrogacy etc) are the imagination of the author/s. So we can give them full marks for their creativity but we cannot accept everything in the the story as “historicaL’ I see a lot of posts on the internet (including on Quora) citing specific planetary configurations mentioned in the book, as proof that everything in the Mahabharat is gospel truth, but consider the following : Isaac Asimov has written the foundation trilogy in the 1940–60 time period. With the technology/ knowledge available to him, he has referred to numerous existing galaxies etc. If an alien civilisation were to discover Asimovs books a 1000 years from now they would tend to believe that because scientifically verifiable facts were present in the story, the story itself must be real. However we know that what Asimov wrote is a work of fiction. And so it is with the planetary configurations proof for the Mahabharata. They show that when the book was written (see Note 1) adequate knowledge of astronomy existed to mention specific planetary positions of the past, but they are not proof that all the events mentioned in the Mahabharat are factually true. Or to use another example>> One can today (in 2019) write a story set in 2026 in Delhi. It can mention existing places (like Rashtrapati Bhawan, parliament house etc) and past true events (like the Lok Sabha election of 2014) . The story goes on to say that in the year 2025, New Delhi was destroyed in a nuclear attack. Someone in Delhi reads the story in 2030 and he also sees that new Delhi has never suffered a nuclear attack and still exists as it did earlier. The story uses historically verifiable facts from 2019, but is the nuclear attack of 2025 true ? Now let us move to a 1000 years later (in 3019 AD), Delhi no longer exists, perhaps obliterated due to a natural disaster or abandoned due to pollution. Another person now reads the story in 3019. Since Delhi no longer exists , he will tend to believe that the nuclear attack mentioned in the story was a true event. But was it ? Or simpler still: Spiderman comics mention New york city. And New york city is real. So Spiderman must also be real. (Correction from Superman to Spiderman as suggested by Bhavya Nayyar) . Or closer home Shaktimaan (TV serial from Doordarshan) has many references to existing Indian cities and places. Therefore Shaktimaan is real. So just because one (or few) verifiable facts are mentioned in a story, it does not make everything else in the story also a historical / scientific fact. Similar is the case with the findings of the submerged Dwarka city. What they tell us is that the writer/s of the Mahabharata were aware of these events (of flooding) , but again they are not proof that all the fantastic events described in the Mahabharata actually occurred. Several answers here have shared pictures of the submerged city, claiming that the city was submerged around 3000 BC .. around the same date that is used to date the MB battle using the planetary positions..ie 3126 BC. Most of those pictures are fake. They are from other submerged locations and not from Dwarka. The National oceanographic Institute located in Goa has dated these submerged ruins to to 1500 BC. So we can say that the Mahabharata is a story written around an event which happened. But to say that the specific events, stories of advanced weapons, and all the fantsastical people mentioned in the Mahabharata are “historical” is a bit juvenile. (Similar stories , of battles in which the gods were also involved, are also available in Greek , Roman , Viking and Chinese mythology. I wonder is there is a debate in Europe and china, on whether they are history or mythology.) A modern comparison could be the films like Ashoka, Jodha Akbar, Mughal e Azaam, Bajirao Mastani. All are based on historical events, but all the events in the film are not exactly historical record. Note 1: Many scholars have expressed the opinion that the Mahabharat as known now is actually an extended version of the older (and shorter) book “Jaya” with 8800 verse, composed around 4C BC. With the passage of time , stories were added to the original (or core) till 4 C AD leading to what we now see as Mahabharat (with 100,000 verses) was created. It is possible that the astronomical references were added only in these later extensions. Also, knowledge of astronomy in India has existed since 12th C BC. Edit 1 For a related discussion please see Why do so many Indian Quorans insist that every bit of modern science came from ancient India? Edit 2 Some of the most-read/ most popular answers to this question have used astronomical calculations, the submerged city of Dwarka and references to Tamil Sangam literature to “prove” that all the Mahabharata events are historically true. I find that in each of the evidences offered in support there is either a flaw in the logic or in the reference itself. I have put my queries to the people who have answered. So far there is no response. Edit 3 Consider this : The Pandava army was 7 akshauhini strong, while Kaurava was 11 akshauhini strong. This means , the following were present on the battlefield: Foot soldiers 19, 68,300 nearly 20 lacs Horses 1,172,880 ie nearly 12 lac horses with 12 lac soldiers mounted on them Elephants 2,62,440 with at least one soldier and one mahout. Chariots 2,62,440 with at least one soldier and one charioteer Thats a total of 44 lac men ..more than the combined army strength of todays India, China USA and Pakistan. Plus the horses and elephants. Does it look like a true historical record ? Or consider this >> In the 7th chapter of Bhisma Parva, this shloka appears.( No 9 ) << ādityataruṇābhāso vidhūma iva pāvakaḥ yojanānāṃ sahasrāṇi ṣoḍaśādhaḥ kila smṛtaḥ>> The translation is >>> mountain called Meru made of gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without smoke. It is eighty-four thousand Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is eighty-four Yojanas.>> The lowest agreed measurement of Yojana is 8 km. So 84,000 yojana would be 6,72,000 km. That would make this mountain 50 times the size of the Earth. Mahabharat has dozens of exaggerations like this. Makes it difficult to accept it as historical record. Edit 4 In the comments section a number of people have pointed out that since the MB as referred to as Itihaas (History) in other scriptures, it MUST be history. Now there are 2 issues here. * Does something become history, just because in the past someone has called it History ? I leave you to judge it for yourself. * Whenever someone has pointed out that it is history/ itihaas, I have asked for the specific book/ chapter where it has been said that MB is Itihaas. SO far only one response has come. That it is from the Satapatha Brahmana. A more specific reference (chapter etc) has not been provided. But here is the interesting thing. In the MB itself , Rishi Yajnavalkya is quoted as saying that he compiled the Satapatha Brahmana . (Mahabharata, Book 12: Santi Parva: Section CCCXIX) . So obviously , the Satapatha Brahmana was composed BEOFRE the MB. By extending this logic, we are led to believe that the MB was already Itihaas even BEFORE it occurred . Like tomorrow’s news yesterday. Edit 5 IN a few comments , I have been called an atheist and anti-Hindu for writing this answer. Another person has accused me of not having IZZAT for the MB. So let me p0int out a couple of things A. Rami Sivan has written a wonderful piece which is relevant. He concludes <<So arguing whether Rama or Krishna were historical characters and whether they actually fought and vanquished the Asuras they were reported to have etc. are all meaningless questions because all their pastimes relate to the niṣkala realm.>> In other words, for a truth -seeker, belief does not depend on whether the Ramayana / Mahabharata are stories or real events. Read the full post and make your own judgment. B. On IZZAT..I am repeating the answer to the comment made by someone: I pray to Lord Shiva mainly in 2 temples. One is about 200 years old and the other is about 700 years old. Does my devotion to Lord Shiva depend on the age of the temple? Am I praying to the stone shivalinga or to Lord Shiva ? If one or both of these temples get destroyed in an earthquake, will I stop praying to Lord Shiva ? My Izzat for the Mahabharat comes from 4 distinct factors: 1. It contains the message of eternal philosophy in the shlokas of the Bhagvat Geeta. 2. It is a brilliant philosophical enquiry on the futility of war. 3. It contains magnificent discussions on other problems of morality and dharma faced by the people living in those times. Many of these are relevant even today. 4. It is a composition of fantastic story-telling and creativity. I am sure you have read the MB and will agree with what I am saying. So now let me tell you this : My admiration of the MB does not depend on whether it is a real event or a story, just as my devotion to Lord Shiva does not depend on the age of the shivalinga. I respect the MB for the message it carries and not for frivolous reasons like what fantastic weapons were used. Thank you for restraining from calling me a chutiya. Now take my comment to the elders in your family and ask them who is the chutiya here.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-strongest-evidences-that-suggest-the-battle-of-Mahabharata-actually-happened/answer/Ajay-Joshi-16] [LINKED_TEXT: Ajay Joshi · 1yIn the Aryan invasion theory, what are the arguments given by its supporters and opponents?Aryan Invasion Theory/ Aryan Migration / Out of India (To clarify, I do not have a problem with Aryan Migration. It happened a long time ago and anyone and everyone committed to India is an Indian even if he/she came in only yesterday. But facts cannot be overlooked and denied to support a particular political view point.) Introduction and nomenclature I see a lot of misconceptions and even more mis-information about the Aryan Invasion Theory. It is common to see answers attributing the AIT to Max Mueller and British colonialists when the fact is that neither had any role to play. There are hundreds of answers on Aryan Invasion/ Migration. Each of them contributes something, but there are very few answers that put the debate in its proper perspective. I am trying here to put together the background framework and a conclusion in the hope this will lead to a more informed discussion. All relevant facts and opinions are already available on the net. The 2 Wikipedia links mentioned below are quite comprehensive. First off, we must see the distinction between a general debate on Aryan Migration (AM) and the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT). The Aryan Invasion Theory was proposed in 1953 (after the Independence of India) by Mortimer Wheeler who served as the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India till 1948. AIT says · Indus Valley Civilisation was destroyed by the Aryans (who were fair skinned people that came from Europe via Central Asia) and the IVC inhabitants were massacred by Aryans (hence the name Aryan “Invasion” Theory). The reference to IVC is an integral and important part of the AIT. So let us remember that it is not a “colonial” tactic from the 19th or early 20th century to establish British/ European cultural supremacy over India and it’s culture, or to “divide Indians on the basis of Aryan vs Dravidian”. AIT is the opinion of just one individual (Wheeler) which did not find wide support either in India or abroad. In fact Mortimer himself changed his view and finally withdrew it. Additionally, Max Mueller had nothing to with AIT because the poor guy died in 1900 , that is 53 years before the theory was proposed and 20 years BEFORE the IVC was discovered.. Note: I have used the word ARYAN for the people who migrated into ndia from around 2000 to 100 CE from the Pontic Steppes of Southern Russia (above the Caspian Sea and stretching from Volgograd / Russia to Kazhakastan) towards East (Iran/ Afghanistan/ India) , South (Turkey) and West (Greece, Poland Germany, France, Latvia, UK) . Due to certain reasons which will become clear later in this article, the word Aryan has now been replaced by “Steppes pastoralists” in areas of Genomics, Archaeology etc. The Pontic Steppe(shown in violet in the map above) is the Steppes region from around Volgograd in Russia and stretching east till Tajikistan. For this reason, many scholars and researchers prefer to use the phrase “steppes pastoralists” rather than Aryans because our good friend Adolf Hitler had sort of brought disrepute to the word Aryan. Also in the last 20 or so years, specifically in India, the word ARYAN has become politically loaded. However despite the disrepute brought by Adolf Hitler, many people have in recent times proudly associated themselves with Aryans in countries stretching from Europe to Asia and continue to do so. Iranians widely believe that the name of the country itself derives from Arya. Afghanistan (before it was destroyed by USA/ USSR/ Taliban used to have a national airline called Ariana Afghan. In India , we had our own Arya Samaj besides of course Arya being a second name used by many (across communities/ castes) specially in North India. A recent trend in India is to use Arya/ Aryan as a first name. Aryan Invasion Theory Now, what Wheeler proposed was very specific . He said that the · Indus Valley Civilisation was destroyed by the Aryans (who were fair skinned people that came from Europe via Central Asia) and · the IVC inhabitants were massacred by Aryans (hence the name Aryan “Invasion” Theory). He went on to say “Indra stands accused”. So AIT is very specific in that the (fair skinned) Aryans destroyed the IVC. This connection with IVC is important, because IVC was discovered only around 1920. Now, to all those who drag in Max Mueller, let me once again remind them, that he died in 1900. So Max Mueller (may his soul rest in peace) could have been involved in AIT only from his grave. As I said earlier, Wheeler later withdrew his views. Please see the Wikipedia excerpt below. From Indo-Aryan migration - Wikipedia <<This position was soon left by the scholarly community, noticing that no evidence was found, and that the skeletons were found to be hasty interments, not massacred victims.[74] Wheeler himself also nuanced this interpretation in later publications, stating \\"This is a possibility, but it can't be proven, and it may not be correct.\\"[75] Wheeler further notes that the unburied corpses may indicate an event in the final phase of human occupation of Mohenjo-Daro, and that thereafter the place was uninhabited, but that the decay of Mohenjo-Daro has to be ascribed to structural causes such as salinisation.[76]>> So, all I can say is that if anyone today is trying to disprove AIT, that person is completely ignorant. AIT has been withdrawn 50 years ago by the guy who proposed it. Disproving it today is similar to disproving that the earth is round. Aryan Migration (is a concept / proposition, not a “theory”) It is actually a proposition/ school of thought and not a “theory”. However in popular discourse the word theory is added. So it becomes AMT and that is the abbreviation I am going to use. Once Mortimer withdrew his theory, the AIT should have been buried and forgotten, But this did not happen, because: A. A dichotomy had long been noticed in the cultures (including language and religious practice) of North and South India. Similarly a significant difference in skin colour was also observable between regions and between castes. This caused some historians/ sociologists (in a time period much before Mortimer came along) and other interested scholars to propose that there were certainly more than one racial group (or more politically correct lineage) present in India since ancient times. Parallely, striking similarities had also been noted between Sanskrit and Latin/ Greek as early as the 17th century. The most well-known and popular work on this language-similarity was done in the late 18th C by William Jones ( d 1794) . Jones was a British philologist who worked for the British East India company in Kolkata. Further developments in language-similarities (called comparative linguistics) suggested that the dichotomies mentioned above could be due to a migration of Aryans into India. Thus was born the idea of Aryan migration. (which is a subset of the Indo European Migrations). The AMT proposes : a. that the Aryans spread from the Pontic Steppes (in Russia) to Europe (Turkey, Germany, UK, Scandinavia, Latvia etc) and Asia (including Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan and India) . They entered India from the north-west ie from Afghanistan. b. The Aryans were fair-skinned people and this explains the wide difference of complexions between regions and castes in India. Thus the presence of fair-skin communities/ castes in India was linked to Aryan migration (and later inter-mixing). According to AM, the Aryans arrived in India through Central Asia , Iran and Afghanistan. And in so arriving they brought their own language which later became Sanskrit. Thus in AMT, Sanskrit language has been linked to arrival of an “outsider” community. c. According to AMT the ARYANS spoke a language (around 4000 BCE) which later developed into Latin, Greek , Slavic and Sanskrit etc. Linguists have reconstructed this “mother“ language as Proto Indo European or PIE and this explains the similarity between Sanskrit and older European languages. Since the custodians of Vedic knowledge and Sanskrit in India are overwhelmingly Brahmins and since they are usually fair-skinned, they were identified as one of the main descendants of the Aryans who migrated in ancient times.(see brief note on genomics at end). d. Similarly, the Vedic belief (which the Aryans practiced in India) has also been linked to migrating Aryans, an outsider community. e. According to AM several of the gods mentioned in the Rig Veda were also worshipped by ancient people in Central Asia/ Europe. As an aside, except for India, all the ancient gods of the Aryans are now no longer gods: they are classified as mythology. In India alone these gods/ deities have survived , the most famous currently being Vishnu. f. As can be seen from the Wikipedia links Indo-European migrations have been subject of considerable study by scholars in the field of archaeology, history, linguistics from many different countries and a comprehensive picture of the migrations (not only to India, but to , many other countries as well) has been built up over the years. I am specifically mentioning this because many mis-informed people in India are not aware of this. They believe that the Aryans chose ONLY India for migration. Indo-Euopean Migrations starting 5000-4000 BCE Out of India Theory Again it is actually a proposition/ school of thought and not a “theory”. However in popular discourse the word theory is added. So it becomes OIT and that is the abbreviation I am going to use. A number of Indian polemicists, but rarely linguists / historians/ archaeologists , have opposed the AIT/AMT claiming instead that language is not related to race / DNA and that the similarity of ancient European languages with Sanskrit is due to the outward flow of Sanskrit (from India) . Thus Sanskrit (or its earlier Indian version) is the mother of all Indo-European languages. The same is true for the presence of Rig Vedic gods outside India. This is called the Out of India Theory (OIT). In summary, OIT rejects AMT and has a counter proposal for every AMT point. In detail, OIT says A. All Indians are from a single genetic stock/ origin from time immemorial and that Aryan Migration was a concept of the British to divide Indians, and it is now a concept used only by the Indian Leftists/ Secularists, again, to divide Indians. In effect OIT followers say that there was no Aryan migration in ancient times. B. According to OIT, similarities between Sanskrit and old European languages was caused by the outward flow of Sanskrit from India. Thus Sanskrit (and not PIE) is the mother of Indo European languages. As a corollary, the lesser informed followers OIT also believe that in ancient India, Sanskrit was the language spoken by the masses in India. C. The similarities between ancient European deities/ gods is similarly explained due to an outward flow of Vedic culture from India. D. The Indus Valley civilization inhabitants used Sanskrit (or an earlier form of it) and the Veda were composed in the region of the Saraswati River by IVC people much earlier than the date/s of 1500 to 1000 BCE proposed by Max Mueller and other historians. While there is no consensus among OIT supporters on the date/s of composition of the Veda, in recent years , a date of 3026 BCE has been widely supported as the date of the Mahabharata war. By extension this puts the date of the Veda composition earlier than 4000 BCE, though some supporters have also claimed dates ranging from 8000 to 10000 BCE. E. Finally OIT people reject the idea that the word ARYA is related to a community/ race. Instead they propose that it was a word used to describe people of noble/ learned qualities. In my opinion this a typical diversionary tactic/ red herring for which the Indian Right wingers have lng been famous. A reading of the RV makes it very clear that the RV composers refer to themselves as ARYA and the word is usd to define a community/ tribe / ethnicity rather than a cultural affiliation. Conclusion This debate centres around 3 major issues • Lineage and looks of the Indian people (skin colour/ facial features / eye colour/ hair colour) • Language (and culture) of the ancient Indian people. • Connection between IVC and Vedic people. In my opinion, on all 3 issues the OIT has a very weak case due to the reasons detailed below. Lineage and Genetics: Without getting into the technicalities of genetics, all of us accept that Africans and Chinese come from separate lineages. We make this judgment based on observation of skin colour and facial features. These “lineage classifications” based on simple observation have been around for a 1000 years. Now they have also been confirmed by genomic analysis. We have the almost EXACT EQUIVALENTS IN India. The Onge/ Jarawa of Andaman and north-eastern people are the Africans and Chinese equivalents in India. Looking at them no one can say that “all Indians are from a single genetic stock/ origin from time immemorial “. Even if we look at the more mainstream areas/ people of India, the lineage differences are plainly visible. Can we say that the Kashmiri people and the Tamil people are from the same lineage/ genetic stock? Thus even without getting into DNA and genomics , just by simple observation we know that the Indian population derives from multiple lineages. However with developments of genomics and DNA analysis techniques these observations have been confirmed in the laboratory. What we have come to know about the Indian population is 1. There are four major ancient lineages and the present population is a mixture of these 4 lineages. Caste and Colour in India : A genomic pointer to the Aryan Invasion/ Migration Theory ?? 2. One of these ancient lineages is Eurasian and this confirms inter-mixing of lineages. In other words it confirms Aryan Migration. One research study puts the date of this migration from about 2000 BCE to 100 AD. https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/Narasimhan_292581.full_.pdf One of the points in this study is that this inter-mixing lasted till about 100 AD, ie well into the historical period. This is also supported recorded history. The Indo-Scythians (known as Saka/ Shaka in Indian texts) came from Central Asia/ Iran and established Kingdoms in India. Their first King was Moga ( 60 BCE). There is currently a town by the name of Moga in Punjab. It is postulated that the present day Jats are descendants of the Saka. The website maintained by a Jat organisaton also confirms this on the basis of DNA analysis. In normal observation also, Hindu Jats (who have remained strictly endogamous) are very different from the communities that surround them. So we actually have historic proof of Aryan Migration, although this particular proof stretches back only to about 300 BCE. 3. Upper caste people in India have a high incidence of the ARYAN GENE (haplogroup R1a1) which is closely related to the Eurasian populations. However, the Indus Valley Civ. People DID NOT have Euraisan ancestry ( Rakhigarhi DNA report) https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/vagheesh/files/piis0092867419309675.pdf So the OIT claim that all Indians are from a single genetic stock since ancient times is disproved both by normal observation as well as genomic research. The wide variation in skin colour and facial features seen in India can only be a result of inter-mixing, ie there was an Aryan migration. AS I will repeat later, genomics is an exact science. Unlike linguistics or archaeology which offer scope of debate and discussion, genomic is rather definite in it’s conclusions. With the available genomic evidence Aryan migration gets established completely. There is no need to go into any further discussion. However, since some of the issues (Language/ culture, Vedic-IVC link have been a part of the ongoing debate, I will touch upon them too. Language and culture The OIT claim is that Sanskrit (or it’s predecessor) was developed in the Indus Valley area and from there spread westward to Central Asia and Europe, and that this happened without any migration / invasions, purely through Sanskrit being a superior product of a more civilized community. Something similar to iPhones spreading out from the USA to the rest of the world. There are some problems with this claim. 1. A comprehensive picture of Indo-European Migrations (from Pontic Steppes outwards) including the spread of PIE languages has been established over a 100 years by dozens of professional historians, linguists and archaeologists working independently. There is a detailed timeline as migrants moved from one place to another (Andronova, Yamnaya, Sintashta etc.) The details can be seen in the Wikipedia article. This comprehensive scenario has not been challenged by any scholars (except OIT of course) from the relevant fields. 2. By contrast the OIT supporters are only about half a dozen mainly polemicists who (except one) are not professional historians, linguists or archaeologists. The only 1 professional historian on the OIT side is Koenrad Elst and he does not support this “Sanskrit is the mother of all languages” position. Also while the OIT side has done some work on linguistics ( Shrikant Talagiri) , there is no work on archaeology or history. In summary OIT makes a claim that Sanskrit is the mother of all languages but has very little redearch / material to back it up. 3. The presence of the Tamil language in India is another blow to OIT. Even OIT supporters agree that Tamil is NOT an Indo-European language. So how did India end up with two different language groups if there was no Aryan Migration? 4. The Rig Veda contains 25 Dravidian words and later Vedic Texts have 87 such words. None of these words are seen in other Indo-European languages. Even the Avestan language from ancient Iran (which is very close to Vedic Sanskrit) , does not have these words .What this means is that Sanskrit (or its predecessor language) came to India from outside and not the other way round. Similarly the Rig Veda also has some words from the Munda language and these words also are not seen in other Indo-European languages. http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/130/1307750464.pdf 5. If one looks at modern languages, there are places where the spoken language is very similar to Sanskrit. Lithuania in particular is one such place. Sanskrit and modern Lithuanian are more similar than Gujarati and Marathi. I have given a sample at the end. Now Lithuania is located in Western Europe 6000 km from India. Between India and Lithuania, the entire region speaks Indo-European languages, but none of them show as much similarity to Sanskrit as Lithuanian. If it was Sanskrit that flowed outwards we should see higher similarity closer to India rather than far away. This is another evidence that disproves the OIT claim of outward flow of Sanskrit. Indus Valley Civilisation linked to Vedic civilization OIT supporters claim that the IVC people and the people who composed the Veda were the same. A corollary of this belief is that the language of the IVC was Sanskrit. Curiously this claim is not supported by much research. It was made by David Frowley who said something like << on the one hand we have IVC with lot of material culture but no scriptural evidence and on the other hand we have the voluminous Vedic texts with no material culture. Since they both connect with the Indus Valley (see note below) it is logical to believe that they are the same >>. So the claim has been made primarily as a logical connection and not on the basis of any archaeological or linguistic research. Note: Several researchers have established that the Saraswati River is clearly mentioned in the Rig Veda and that it is a mighty, living river, not a dried up river. This would imply that the Rig Veda was composed AT LEAST BEFORE 2000 BCE which is the agreed upon date for the drying of the Saraswati. This gives the Rig Veda at least some time-overlap with the IVC. There are several advantages for the OIT lobby in making this claim. 1. It connects Sanskrit to an era of 2500 BCE and older and thus supports the proposition that Sanskrit is the mother of all Indo-European languages. 2. It establishes Sanskrit as a “purely Indian” language and not a language brought in by an outsider community, namely the Steppes pastoralists/ Aryans. 3. It establishes the Vedic culture as “purely Indian” with no foreign (European) content. But again there are several problems with this claim. In detail : 1. The biggest challenge is from DNA analysis. Recent DNA research proves conclusively 3 things a. Current Indian population comprises of 4 ancient lineages and one of them connects with Eurasians (or Aryans/ Steppes pastoralists). b. That an intermixing of Aryan (or Steppes pastoralist) genes took place from 4200 to 2000 years before present. c. IVC people do NOT have the Steppes pastoralist mitochondial DNA ) which is now widespread in the Indian population. Now DNA analysis is more or less conclusive. It is not the same as linguistics (or even archaeology) which provides a scope discussion and debate. So at best, in view of the DNA evidence, the mention of a living Saraswati in the Veda implies that the Vedic people while they may have lived (at least partially) in the same time frame as the IVC, they were distinct from the IVC people. Possibly the Aryans arrived in the region of the upper stretch of the Indus/ Saraswati (Srinagar/ Islamabad) around 2500 BCE and were witness to the as yet flowing Saraswati. Within a short period, the Saraswati dried up (2000 BCE). * The word for Elephant in Clasical Sanskrit is HASTI (leading to Hindi Haathi). The word Hasti itself derives from the Vedic Sanskrit word HASTI-MRIG which transliterates to HAND -ANIMAL. In Vedic Sanskrit MRIG is the generic word for “animal” and HASTI comes from HASTA meaning hand. The Vedic people had not seen an elephant before they came to India. So they called it an “animal with hand’ , where the hand refers to the trunk of the elephant. By contrast Tamil has a word for elephant ..AANA. Now if the VEdics were the same as the IVC people, they should have had a single word for elephant rather than calling it aninal with hand. So it becomes clear that the VEdic people were not the same as IVC people. 2. The horse which is a very important part of the Vedic culture is completely missing in the IVC. It is not present in the IVC seals which record a number of other animals (cattle/ tiger/ elephant/ rhinoceros/ buffalo etc). OIT supporters have time and again tried to prove that the horse existed in IVC. Sometimes they have even faked data/ references. But as of date, OIT has not been able to provide any solid proof of the existence of the horse in the IVC. 3. The Rig Veda presents a picture of a nomadic pastoral culture. Whereas IVC is an urban culture. There is no mention of cities, large buildings, public bath, granaries etc in the Rig Veda. In summary, not a single claim of the OIT stands on solid ground. The Politics of the debate To be continued >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Similarities between Sanskrit and Lithuanian (quoted from another answer on Quora) Here are two sentences, one in sanskrit, one in lithuanian: Sanskrit: Kas tvam asi? Asmi svapnas tava tamase nakte. Agniṃ dadau te śradi tada viśpatir devas tvam asi. Lithuanian: Kas tu esi? Esmi sapnas tavo tamsioje naktyje. Ugnį daviau tau širdy, tada viešpatis dievas tu esi.

Sivan is also the most important god for Tamil since ancient times. This could be the reason for linking Rudra with the non-Vedic deity known as Sivappu/ Sivan, finally leading to the merging (in Puranic times) of the vedic Rudra with Sivan and creating Lord Shiva. Edit 2 A number of people have written comments that Shiva appears in the Rudram (Yajur Veda). Yes, the WORD shiva appears as an ADJECTIVE for Rudra. It does not appear as the NAME of a god/ deity. I have already provided details of the use of this word shiva being used as an adjective in the Rig veda. Additionally with specific reference to the Rudram: The opening shloka of Namakam Namaste Rudra manyava utota ishave Namah | Namaste astu dhanvane bahubhya muta te Namah || Oh! Rudra Deva! My salutations to your anger and also to your arrows. My salutations to your bow and to your two hands. Ya ta Ishu shivatama shivam babhuva te dhanuh | Shiva sharavya ya tava taya no Rudra mrudaya || Oh! Rudra! By favour of your arrow, bow, and quiver, which have shed their anger and turned auspicious, please render us happy. Few points to note AA>> Rudra is armed with a bow and arrow. In popular tradition Shiva does not carry a bow/ arrow. BB> Reference is made to Rudra’s anger and also to “shedding” of anger CC>> The word “shiva” appears 3 times,but ALWAYS as an adjective for Rudra . Further, the mantra most often used for aarti; the pujas that offers light to the deity; “Namaste astu bhavagan vishvesvaraya mahadevaya triyambakaya triupurantakaya trikal Agni kalaya kalagni Rudraya nilakanthaya mrutyunjayaya sarveshvaraya sadashivaya sriman mahadevaya Namah” “Let my salutations be to that great God who is the Lord of the universe; the great God who has three eyes and who destroys Tripura, the three Asura cities. To that God who is the Dandhya time when the three sacred fires are lit; who is Rudra the fire that consumes the universe; whose throat is blue; who has conquered death; the Lord of all; the ever auspicious one; salutations to that glorious and great God.” Again sada-shivaya is used as an adjective <<the ever auspicious one>> Edit 3 in some of the comments Lord Vishnu has been referred. Now here is the interesting thing. In the Vishnu Sahasranama ( the 1000 names of Vishnu found in section 13.135 Anushasana Parva of Mahabharata, and several Vaishnava Purana ) the word shiva is used twice. In both cases it is used as an adjective to describe Lord Vishnu as pure/ auspicious, same as the usage of the word in Rig Veda to describe Rudra. The MB and Purana were composed at least 500 years after the Veda, but the word shiva is used with the meaning of “pure”, it does not by any stretch of imagination imply lord Shiva. sarvaḥ śarvaḥ śivaḥ sthāṇurbhūtādirnidhiravyayaḥ | saṁbhavō bhāvanō bhartā prabhavaḥ prabhurīśvaraḥ || 4 || 25.

The Stones are the archetypal rock group, and as far as I’m concerned they’re still in the prime, while the Who pretty much stopped being the Who the day Keith Moon died. But if you want to see the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World on Dec. 11, 1968, check out the Who’s performance at the Stones’ Rock and Roll Circus. On other days in the late 1960s/early 1970s, it was often the Stones, IMO, and it was never anybody else besides those two bands. Other answers have noted the Who’s musicianship; Townshend, Entwistle, and Moon all played their instruments in unique ways that gave the Who a sound that nobody else has ever duplicated. Musically, the Stones did what lots of their contemporaries were doing, but they did it better, and they still do it. Yes, Mick Taylor was the best guitarist to play in either band, but Keith and Ronnie have a lot of heart and reach more deeply into the blues than the Who, which is what makes the Stones so great. The Wyman/Watts/Richards rhythm section was as virtuoso as the Who, though in a less flashy and obvious way. My iTunes playlist is 50% Stones, 15% Who, the rest a mix of classic rock and blues. So there’s my vote."},{"instruction":"f Kim Jongun is dead, then why aren't they declaring it in the open?","output":"To clarify before I answer, rumours of Kim Jong-Un’s death are just that, rumours. Nothing is confirmed and South Korea has recently suggested he is likely to be in good health, although many other news outlets disagree. Regardless, nothing is known except that the dictator has not be seen in public for many days, but given Coronavirus fears it is possible he is simply hiding for his own safety. However, in the interests of answering the question, let’s assume that Kim Jong-Un is in fact dead. In that case, right now, the government of North Korea would be committing all their efforts to making sure that, for the time being, absolutely no one finds out. The reason is simple, North Korea is a government built entirely on the power of the Kim family. The authority of the dictator is total and power is maintained through generals who serve the dictator in return for being kept in high rank and power. As a result, everything, and I mean everything relies on the Supreme Leader. When the Supreme Leader dies, there is a moment where there is no Supreme Leader. This moment is deeply problematic. Normally however problems are minimal as the heir is clear, the Supreme Leader’s son, and the new leader is in power before the public even know. It was to ensure that power was transferred before anyone was aware of the Supreme Leader’s death that news of Kim Jong-Il’s death was kept entirely secret for two or three days. ~~~ Kim Jong-Il ~~~ So why has the government kept quiet so much longer than that? Because this time there’s an issue. An issue that come become incredibly serious. Kim Jong-Un has one known child, and two suspected. That known child is Kim Ju-Rae his 7-seven-year-old daughter who is clearly unfit for power at the current point. So the question is: what the hell happens now? And the answer, that is who exactly will succeed him, is hard to know. By far the most likely is that it will be one of his siblings, the issue here is simple: he has 4. And who exactly will succeed him is not instantly apparent. Speculation implies that the most likely candidate would be Kim Yo-Jong, Jong-Un’s younger sister, as what limited information we have implies she holds the most power in the country out of his siblings. ~~~ Kim Yo-Jong ~~~ Her claim however is almost identical to Jong-Un’s 3 other siblings, each of whom could cause a political crisis if they themselves made a bid for Supreme Leader. Furthermore North Korea is full of incredibly powerful generals, if they felt the future of the Kim family to be uncertain or the claim of the heir weak it is highly possible one or more would attempt a coup or simply pool local resources and defy government until things stabilise. Already the situation is complicated and you can see why the government would be eager to hide things until succession is clear, but it gets worse. Since 2006, North Korea has been in possession of nuclear weapons and even ignoring these its wider arsenal of missiles and chemical weapons is extensive. The second government in North Korea becomes unstable, these are at risk. The risk of these weapons falling into the hands of renegade generals or being misused in a power struggle is more than China, South Korea, or the United States could tolerate. It is highly possible that these governments would see necessary to take military action to rapidly seize these weapons before they can be misused. Even ignoring the risk of misuse, the United States especially but many other powers too have ever since 2006 been eager for an opportunity to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, an opportunity Jong-Un’s potential death would give. Basically all of the above is uncertain, it is possible that succession would be clear and immediate with no real problems, however it is also possible that Jong-Un’s death could result in a dynasty-ending power struggle or even foreign invasion. This risk is too much to bear for the North Korean government. Hence, if it is that Kim Jong-Un has dead, it would at the current point be the number one priority of the North Korean government to make sure no one, and that means absolutely no one, finds out."},{"instruction":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","output":"Conscious decision making, I takes it to mean is the intention pertaining to “could use\\" in the question - what would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?.

But I'll do my best to recommend a few that are definitely worth checking out. If you're into sci-fi, I highly recommend \\"Stranger Things\\" on Netflix. It's a thrilling and nostalgic ride through the 80s with a group of kids who stumble upon a supernatural mystery in their small town. The characters are lovable and the story is engaging from start to finish. If you're in the mood for a drama, \\"Breaking Bad\\" is a must-watch. The series follows a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine after being diagnosed with cancer. The show is intense, well-written, and the acting is top-notch. For comedy, \\"The Office\\" is a classic. The show follows the daily lives of the employees at a paper company and is filmed in a mockumentary style. It's funny, heartwarming, and relatable, with a cast of characters you'll grow to love. If you're in the mood for a fantasy epic, \\"Game of Thrones\\" is a must-watch. The series is set in a fictional world and follows several noble houses as they fight for control of the Iron Throne. It's a complex and engaging story with plenty of action, political intrigue, and memorable characters. Lastly, if you're looking for something more recent, \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" on Netflix is a fantastic limited series. It tells the story of a young girl who becomes a chess prodigy in the 1960s and deals with addiction and personal struggles along the way. The acting is fantastic, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story is gripping. There are plenty of other great TV series out there, but these are just a few that I highly recommend.

Why or why not?","output":"Yes. I believe what goes around comes around. But not for everyone. What some consider”karma” I believe it is The Work of The God. I truly believe He gets revenge for some people who are wronged, oppressed, #bullied, etc. Who don't, can't, won't get revenge for themselves. And what I mean by “not for all people” is that The God judges by intentions, the state of the #heart at the time. Some people do things to others unknowingly, by mistake or in the heat of the moment, etc. So, in those cases, is it really necessary or just to take revenge on them? That's why #patience is so important, then, #communication. If I don't know I've hurt you and we don't discuss it, how can I apologize or even explain my actions? And even if one, after being told that they have hurt someone, but don't see why it would hurt them, or feel within themselves the same wouldn't hurt them, apologize any way. For we don't know a person's hurt level. Where something that hurts me, doesn't hurt another, doesn't lesson the hurt. Where someone get get in the boxing ring and can take whatever punches the opponent throughs, another gets knocked down after the first punch. If someone says you've hurt them, it doesn't take much from your day or life to just apologize. And I truly believe that is what holds back the “revenge” or “karma” as some put it. And if the person you've hurt is out of reach or won't talk to you, then do something good on their behalf. Which I believe will also hold back the pay back. Also, those who have been hurt, forgive them. Want for your #brother what you want for yourself. To be #forgiven for your #mistakes and short comings. Don't we want The #God's #forgiveness for ourselves?

In Kashmir , we eat one thing for sure - Rice Not every Muslim majority state has biryani cooking expertise. - Misconception actually ! I will mention eating rituals along with daily & wedding ,festival foods you must try … (Based personal experiences but of course ) Morning breakfast - lipton tea or noon (salt) tea/chai with baked break ( called kandur bread similar to tandoori roti but its not unhealthy & its made up of wheat ,I guess ) ..that with butter or some toast or in we eat that bread with sabzi also. Local eateries will give you paranthas too so don't worry . Breakfast - usually saag (haak , kashmiri saag) with rice or some gravy chicken & yes, we love our simple chutneys with kashmiri pickles. Dinner - some gravy or saag or some sabzi with rice. If its winter, we consume kahwa instead of tea or just because one is ill. Do visit any dargah there & outside vendors there will be selling their halwa, roti(deep fried) , boiled lentils with hint of masala ( they are black in colour & super healthy) , there might be fried pakoras of lotus stem, potatoes and fishes etc. Sometimes in street while shopping you might find people selling boiled salted chick pea or chole with roti along with pickles & they will make a wrap for you and its so delicious. Wedding & festivities - We have a group of men who are called waza who prepare wazwan & that generally includes all the major mouth watering non veg dishes. I can't start naming them all but just ask anyone where you can get wazwan (authentic one) and they will guide you happily. Its a screenshot picture of wazwan & the meat served is only the starting part of the royal feast. Then if you are wondering about the sweet dishes - We have tonns of bakeries there (mughal darbar is the oldest & famous one ) which has cakes, pastries, cocunut biscuits and namkeen as well.

I want them as companions for humans.","output":"Go for the goat. I raise both. As well as rabbits. And, in most circumstances, I’d say get the goats. Rabbits would win over if the animal had to be kept inside because goats in the house leads to complete chaos and broken things. Rabbits are like rats, but dumber. It’s not so much that goats are that great (but they are), it’s that chickens are pretty primal. They’re actually the closest living relative to the T-rex [ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3340709/Chicken-is-T-rexs-closes-living-relative.html ]. A few years ago, we had a rooster who started to get aggressive with me, to the point I carried one of the children’s wooden shovels every time I went outside. He’d run through my swings and attack my legs. I’d kick him. He’d come back. Finally, I’d had enough. If the damn cock went after my boy, who was then probably only four or five, he’d get him on the ground and fuck him up. We had to take the rooster out. My Hubby and I discussed the best method. Our chickens are layers, not meat chickens, and we’re not set up for the dispatching process. Last time we had to kill a few roosters, we went with the axe on the log and we thought we could do better with a gun. We were wrong. To make a long, gruesome story short, we ended up injuring the rooster and had to go into the coop to get him to end him humanely. He was bleeding. Badly. And this intrigued the hens. They ended up attacking him. I wrote out the details, but deleted them. It’s unnecessary to read the gruesome horror. Just know that I have never looked at a chicken the same way again. The way those hens looked at that rooster, the cock who had lead their flock, I guarantee it was the same way a dinosaur looked at its prey. Cocking their heads to the right. Then to the left. One stepped forward. Hesitation. Head cock. Weird double eyelid blink. Head cock the other way. Anyway, they frenzied and it was ugly af. You don’t want a chicken as a pet. They’re like little dinosaurs. And yes they can be affectionate. And fun to watch. Yes, they’ll follow you around and let you pet them.

I mean all the specifications are enough to prove to anybody that the handset is there to surprise people with its quality aspects. If the best aspects of an ideal handset are to be asked to people, I am sure that people will come with different answers and this is justified up to a great extent. Every individual, owing to their respective fields, requires different features. The best thing about Realme Narzo 10 is that everyone gets something from the company and this is its quality. Realme Narzo 10’s 6.5 inches Mini-drop full screen has the quality that everyone cherishes.

For clear reasons, a handset gets heated somewhat when it is getting used for any activity for a long time. MediaTek Helio G80 in Realme Narzo 10 has Mali-G52 GPU for astounding appearances. Its 4 GB RAM and 128 GB storage are the extra support for the processor. Finally, Realme Narzo 10 has 48 MP AI quad cameras with a number of modes and features.

I will be direct here, it wasn’t easy and I found myself moving from room to room for around 5 weeks while I found suitable accommodation. That’s not easy here as it is a popular resort and long term rentals are scarce. I had a little bad luck too, my car broke down after the second day of ownership and I have been using public transport and walking everywhere. I had the pleasure of my sisters company for 3 days during the split and it was a help to me that she witnessed the raging madness that ensued. That’s where we both rationalised my wife’s behaviour and came up with borderline personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies. She had actually been diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD and OCD, largely due a very traumatic event as a child and subsequent fallout thereafter. Having begun the process of moving on, I found it a great help to remember there is no reasoning with such a person in that state of mental turmoil and I made every effort to focus on myself and the tasks in front of me… a daily list of tasks that I ticked off once they were achieved. I also reminded myself that , whilst this has been a costly mistake in every sense , I was in a beautiful place and had many friends (mostly mutual who have all been amazing in non judgement )… it has been made clear to my wife that she should not be vindictive and seek revenge for my audacity in standing up to her. I understand she has lost her audience and hopefully that will keep her minding her own business. My dogs and cats are well looked after and while I miss them badly, it could be worse. Every day is a new one and ive retuned my guitars and ploughed into reading/cooking when I am lonely. most nights I occupy the same seat in a local restaurant and reflect on the days progress.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to this approach that may make it difficult or undesirable for [LINKED_TEXT: dating sites] [URL: https://www.thedatingway.com/] [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #XNCGb] to implement:Privacy concerns: Requiring users to provide a government ID could raise privacy concerns and deter some users from signing up for the platform. Users may be hesitant to provide sensitive information to a third-party company, particularly given the potential for data breaches or other security issues.Cost: Implementing an ID verification system can be costly, particularly for smaller dating sites or those that are just starting out. The costs associated with verifying user identities could ultimately be passed on to users in the form of higher fees or reduced functionality.User experience: Requiring users to go through an ID verification process could create additional friction during the registration process and make it more difficult for some users to sign up for the platform. This could ultimately lead to lower user adoption and retention rates.Potential for false positives: Even with an ID verification system in place, it is still possible for fake profiles to slip through the cracks.

Google “stickleback fish study”. It also applies to humans. Female humans choose their mates, based upon smell. It’s not the only factor, but it does play a key role, as our everyone’s scent represents their entire immunity against bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It’s how we evolved, in order to combat the greater ability, of these organisms. When this becomes general knowledge, women will be able to respond, as they see fit. How do we evaluate all things, in order to make choices? Emotional value, which is determined by our genes, the environment, knowledge, experience, our physical, mental, and emotional states, and a bunch more. By will alone, humans are unable to alter the emotional value of anything. If we could, then we’d be able to enjoy eating foods we hate. We could enjoy the company of people, we dislike. We’d have free will. For the average individual to change their nature, they will need a great deal of motivation. They would have to overcome decades worth of neural networks."},{"instruction":"Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?","output":"India is a diverse country and home to hundreds and thousands of languages. Only 22 languages are mandated by the constitution. It is important to note that the majority of Indian languages are older than Hindi and have rich heritages that Hindi can’t match. Indians don’t accept Hindi as their language except those who claim it to be their mother tongue. Hindi is not meant to unite Indians. Hindi was intended and promoted as the official language of the Indian Union to kick English out of India. So what started as a false pride in Hindi as the counterbalance against English ended in English gaining an upper hand. It is the foolishness of Hindi supporters that made others fight against Hindi. What a majority of morons who made Hindi the official language of the Indian union did not understand was that non-Hindi speakers will favor English even at the cost of jeopardizing their language to fight Hindi hegemony. The rest is history — Hindi is losing out to English and the whole of India is being anglicized. At the end of the day, English has emerged victorious against all Indian languages including Hindi. It is not just Hindi that is fading, every Indian language is fading into oblivion. So what is the solution? Remove the unwarranted tilt toward Hindi and start to tilt toward all Indian languages. The ongoing debate over Hindi imposition is not just a trigger; it is a time bomb that will soon explode and dismember the Indian union into independent countries."},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"If we consider the equation in a time frame, the ship is necessarily not the same.

Even Lord Budhha is said to been born in a republic of the Sakya clan in Kapilavastu . The leader of the republic was called Rajan as well but he was merely the first among equals and thus not a true monarch . The prototype in historical studies has been the Lichhavi republic .These republics were not true democracies in the sense of each adult getting to vote but in these republics each tribe/clan/section depending upon the organisation of the said republic would sent its representative to the central committee . The leader of this committee was the Rajan . The committee oversaw all the functions of the state through sub committees made of groups from the central committee . These areas included taxation , defense, administration , urban upkeep etc . The Budhha was said to have been so impressed by the Lichhavis that it is said he modelled his Sangha along similar lines. When Ajatsatru wanted to establish the sway of Magadha , he asked Budhha for advice on how to defeat the invincible Lichhavis. The Budhha allegedly told him as long as the committe would stand , so would Lichhavi .

Why did I ask a question like this? In Romans 8 chapters, 1-2 verses, the Bible, the very word of God says, that there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ. What does this mean? If you have accepted with all your heart the salvation that all mankind needs, you have no condemnation, there is no wall between you and the Lord, and in the very light of your fellowship you can enjoy, but if you have not accepted it, condemnation, the wall still stands between you and the Lord . You are not reconciled to the Lord What does this mean? You can go to church regularly every day, every Sunday, try to do everything for the Lord, be good, not swear, do not steal, simply, a good man, but even in 50 years you do not understand the salvation you have from the Lord , that you do not realize until the end of your life that you have not given your whole heart to him, that you have never said with words and heart, that you need his forgiveness, that guilt and the sacrifice of Christ do not reach you. You know ... God wants everyone to be saved, but we ignorantly pray many times for many things without being reconciled to the Lord, and because He is merciful, answer the prayer, and if he answers the prayer even if you are not accepted his sacrifice, and you are not aware of anything, how much he will answer prayers and be your living God, if you give him life with all your heart today! The Lord always answers the prayer, even silence is the answer, maybe you still have to wait for something, or there is a wall that is between you and the Lord, and only man can make that wall. I see, many people say that God does not exist because he does not answer prayers, but know that God seeks a heart that sincerely loves him, not a robot, not a created creature that will love him, but a man who sincerely seeks him, and know that if all you seek the Lord with your heart, he cannot but answer! By accepting Jesus and his sacrifice, the Holy Spirit, his Spirit enters you, and to every prayer every question you have an answer from him. God always works best for everyone even when you don't hear the answer, and you don't see, he still answers :)!

To grasp these ideas, you'll need a rudimentary understanding of motion, vectors, and scalar quantities. Here are some of the most significant topics to remember for this chapter. Scalar quantity Scalars are physical quantities which are independent of changes in a vector space basis in physics. Scalars are frequently accompanied by measuring units, such as \\"10 cm.\\" A change in a vector space basis affects the description of a vector in terms of the basis utilized, but not the vector itself, whereas a scalar has no bearing on this. In classical theories, including Newtonian physics, this physical definition of scalars means that rotations or reflections maintain scalars, but Lorentz transformations or space-time translations preserve scalars in relativistic theories. A physical amount of scalar, like other physical quantities, is often stated by a numerical value and a physical unit, not just a number, to convey its physical meaning. It may be thought of as the sum of the number and the unit. A physical distance is independent of the length of each base vector in a coordinate system, where the length of the base vector corresponds to the physical distance unit in use. A physical distance varies from a metric in that it is not just a real number, but the metric is computed to a real number; nonetheless, the metric may be converted to the physical distance by converting each base vector length to the associated physical unit. Any change in a coordinate system may have an impact on the formula for computing scalars but not on the scalars themselves. A change in a coordinate system has no effect on vectors, but it does modify their descriptions. Vector quantity In physics, a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is often represented by an arrow with the same direction as the amount and a length proportionate to the magnitude of the quantity. A vector, although having magnitude and direction, does not have the location. In other words, if a vector is shifted parallel to itself, its length remains unchanged. Scalars are ordinary quantities that have a magnitude although no direction, as opposed to vectors. Velocity, Displacement, as well as acceleration, for instance, are vector quantities, whereas time, speed, as well as mass are scalars. A vector space is a set of objects entitled vectors which may be combined together and multiplied by numbers termed scalars in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Scalars are typically real numbers, but certain vector spaces support scalar multiplication by complex numbers or, more broadly, by a scalar from any mathematical field. Vector addition and scalar multiplication must meet specific constraints known as vector axioms. The words real vector space and complex vector space are frequently used to define whether the scalars in a specific vector space are real numbers or complex numbers. A vector space is commonly represented by certain sets of Euclidean vectors. They represent physical quantities such as forces, where any two forces of the same kind may be joined to generate a third, and a force vector multiplied by a real multiplier yields another force vector. Vector spaces are formed in the same way (but in a more geometric meaning) by vectors representing displacements in the plane or three-dimensional space. Vectors in vector spaces do not have to be arrow-like objects, as they appear in the examples: vectors are viewed as abstract mathematical objects with certain qualities, which can be seen as arrows in some instances. Linear algebra is concerned with vector spaces, which are distinguished by their dimension, which generally corresponds to the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces naturally arise in mathematical analysis as function spaces with vectors that are functions. These vector spaces are usually supplied with some extra structure, such as a topology, which allows them to tackle concerns of closeness and continuity. Topologies defined by a norm or inner product are the most often utilized of these (being equipped with a notion of distance between two vectors). This is especially true for Banach and Hilbert spaces, which are crucial in mathematical analysis. Motion in a Plane A plane of motion is one in which a body moves from one place to another on the X and Y axes. It is possible to calculate velocity by taking the distance traveled by an object and the time it takes to move along an object's vertical or Y-axis and then multiplying it by the time taken. Similarly, the body's acceleration may be calculated by charting velocity along the X-axis and time along the Y-axis. We'll go through every aspect of motion in a plane in this section, starting with an introduction and formulae for understanding it all. Get [LINKED_TEXT: Doubtnut app] [URL: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubtnutapp] for more information Plane Motion Parameters Distance, speed, and acceleration were all examined in the previous section under the heading \\"Motion Parameters.\\" One dimension of motion and the following factors must be thoroughly studied in order to comprehend motion in a plane. From the point when an object begins its trip to its final destination, distance is used to determine how far something has traveled. Because it's a scalar physical quantity, we have no idea which way the train is taking us; we just know how far we got from Delhi to Bangalore.The time is a scalar variable; thus, we only know how long it will take us to go to Delhi from Dehradun, but not the direction the train heads in.In physics, the term \\"velocity\\" refers to the rate at which something moves. The pace at which an object's location changes in relation to a frame of reference and time is demonstrated by its velocity. Well! Because velocity is essentially the speed of an item in a certain direction, the term might seem confusing.In addition to describing the amplitude and direction of a body's motion, displacement measures the shortest distance a body may travel to go from one location to another."},{"instruction":"Do many Americans want to decide the Presidency directly, rather than by using the electoral college? I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"No. The Electoral College has NOTHING to do with communications. It has everything to do with population. Our founding fathers, and the framers of the Constitution were concerned that population centers (cities), would have more sway that the citizens that did not live in urban areas. They chose the EC, to allow everyone have an opportunity to be heard. Without the EC, the 2016 election would have been decided by less than a quarter of the land mass of the US. All elections would be decided by the same small proportion of land areas of the US. Again, by having the EC, it gives everyone a say…a voice. We do not vote directly for our President, likewise, we do not have a “national popular vote”. Rather, we have 50 seperate popular votes. As such, if a state needs (X) amount of votes to for one candidate to win it….and recieves (X) +1, the plus one is “extra”….only (X) is needed to get the coveted electoral votes. Another wzy of looking at this, if I need 100 dollars to buy an item, it does not matter that I have 120 bucks….all that is needed is 100 bucks.

My coworkers and I aren’t any better at teaching than our public school colleagues, yet we often have less stress and get better results than them. Why? Because we have fewer discipline issues from students to deal with, fewer manifestations of crappy home lives for our students to deal with, and less red tape from the administration to deal with. Sending your child to a private school isn’t about what the school has, but rather, what it lacks. It lacks all of the things that people hate about public schools: undisciplined students, unrealistic expectations from teachers, and administrative micromanaging. I teach students in the 11–14-year-old age range within the city limits of Chicago. Recently, an 11-year-old boy was arrested here for carjacking. It wasn’t his first offense. It’s not uncommon for children as young as 12 to be members of gangs in this city. Public middle schools in the city are rife with discipline issues. Most public schools have some sort of security presence due to all of the discipline issues with students. Meanwhile, here I am, teaching the same-aged students in the same city, and I’ve never had to deal with students fighting. I leave my phone and laptop out in my classroom all day, and none of my students have ever thought to swipe them. The worst discipline issue I have to deal with on a regular basis is overly-social students while I’m trying to teach. Every few years, the private school district I work for does a parent survey. One of the questions they ask is, “why did you choose to send your child to a private school?” Every year, the number one answer is: safety. That is, safety from the type of classmates they’d likely have in a public school in this city. And that’s what parents are paying for with private schools: a better experience for their children. It’s not better because of what the school has, but it’s better because of what the school doesn’t have.

Indeed, unlike the Agile Manifesto, there has been no consortium of industry experts or thought leaders to actually create an agreed upon definition much less build out a set of practices, principles, methodologies, or guidelines as in the case of ITIL or CMMI. DevOps can include a very broad set of specialized tasks, tools and SMEs, and limiting this question to SAs may not be specific enough to get the answer you desire. That said I thought the list provided in the other answer I read was quite good. I assume you are asking about an OS SA and not another type of SA. There are tons of free tools to be had. Just Google your question and a bunch of links to various lists comes up. Here's my addition to the lists provided: For Windows SAs check out this link for a list of freeware tools,[LINKED_TEXT: http://www.gfi.com/blog/the-30-best-free-tools-for-sysadmins/#.VmPQpZLil0E.mailto.] [URL: http://www.gfi.com/blog/the-30-best-free-tools-for-sysadmins/#.VmPQpZLil0E.mailto] Then there are these: * Wireshark * Virtual Box * Vagrant * Docker * VnC * Putty (for Windows users) * Ansible In principle I am also a big fan of automation, and finding or authoring scripts, or macros for repetitive tasks will be a huge help. Of course if your organization does not have an automation platform that can bring some level of management to scripted tasks then I recommend installing and using git to version control your scripts. Developers use SCM tools to manage the code they write. It's a good practice that SAs should adopt for any scripts they develop."},{"instruction":"Why do Iranians deny their Turkic roots and the Turkic influence on Iranian history and culture?","output":"We Do Not!"},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"The Ukrainian Army is led by a Russian.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"I had a daughter. Her mother became pregnant and we moved into a house together. Six months later my daughter was born. Mom had four children from another marriage and made an effort to remind the older children she was their half-sibling. When she was two, the older siblings went from full time with us to half the time with their dad. When she was five, I started to notice mother’s subtle abuses through passive aggression and blame: having my daughter’s hair develop tangles and using a comb to brush, blaming the five-year-old for the tangled hair, and then chopping her hair off. This happened three times by the time she was five years old — and her mom was a hairdresser. I filed for divorce and custody was joint. My daughter looked a lot like me. So it was a shocker when paternity was challenged. Police knocked on my door and showed me a court order. Mom waited across the street with her ex-husband while a social worker had to pull my daughter away screaming and begging to stay. The social worker kept apologizing and let my daughter come running back when my daughter started to have an asthma attack. After about 20 minutes, a police sergeant came up to the front porch where I was with my daughter, who had started to calm down and her breathing was under control at this point. He just looked at me and said, “I’m sorry,” then walked back to the curb. He spoke to the other two officers, who got in their cars and left. Then he walked across the street and talked to my wife and her ex. After a few minutes he handcuffed her ex-husband, put him in his cruiser, and left. Mom walked across the street and stood at the curb. I told my daughter that everything was going to be all right, that I’d see her soon, that I loved her and I was so proud of her. I promised her I’d see her soon. Mom told her she’d see me the next week as she took her hand, then they drove off. I haven’t seen her since. I decided a long time ago I was not going to fight it. The divorce court changed the case to divorce without children and it was over. I haven’t heard anything and have no rights to inquire about how my daughter is doing. She is 8 now and likely can’t remember what I look like, and in a few more years she’ll barely remember me at all. Better for her that I fade away than to risk more traumatic incidents. I miss all of the kids, my daughter and her siblings. I was their father, and now I’m not. I don’t think I will ever stop hurting."},{"instruction":"f the boundary layer separates from the airfoil, does the lift coefficient increase or decrease? Why?

But unvaccinated children die of preventable diseases. Does your daughter in law want to bury her children after they contract measles? Or watch them gasp their lives away in an iron lung because she was too afraid of a (genetic) neurological difference to protect them from the real threat to their well being? Note: Autism isn’t a tragedy. It is not something dreadful that will ruin your child’s life. It is just differences in the neurological connections in the brain, which can lead to different sensory experiences. It doesn’t prevent a long, enjoyable and fulfilling life, although some simple accommodations will help. It is a natural variation in the human experience. However, your child scraping their knee then contracting tetanus and ending up dead is a tragedy, which no amount of accommodation will ever ease.

The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels. Novavax say they are wary, following the AZ vaccine program. Who is telling the truth?","output":"I suspect both are correct. From the point of view of the EU they are keen to get a contract set in stone with legally enforceable delivery dates as one may do when ordering paper clips. Vaccine contracts are not like that and the EU is unlikely to get any company to sign such a thing. Vaccine manufacture is complex with typically over 100 supplies needed. The production of Covid vaccine is pushing the normal vaccine production of 3.6 billion doses up to around 13 billion doses a year. That is quite a challenge which the companies are trying to meet. There will be hiccups, the contract has to reflect that. If you want the bargain basement price price, as the EU seems keen to do, then three will be issues getting the deal they think they are entitled to. From the point of view of the company, they are in a position of being able to sell all the vaccine they can make. They may be looking at a location to put a new plant but they will want to babe able to export the production of the vaccine to other counties etc from that factory to ensure every shot is used. They will have seen how the EU has treated AZ and Pfizer and the threats to introduce export controls, without understanding their impact. It also seems that approval of manufacturing plants takes a huge amount of time. I am sure that their expects have spoken to colleges in other companies. AZ has been reasonably vocal about it regrets about dealing with the EU and Pfizer indicated that if export restrictions were introduced they would cut production in the EU. I suspect the EU will struggle to get new supplies of vaccines and it may take one of the larger countries like Germany to step in and sort it out or a new Commission President who is more able to negotiate with both the companies and countries to get the best supply they can."},{"instruction":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","output":"All those wealth or developments were made with the help of stealing east pakisthan's (Bangladesh) money and export oriented earnings.

Let me introduce you to our new, future elite lineup of heroes… Trailblazer Our first in the lineup is Trailblazer, an obese black teenager that totally wasn’t put here for representation and probably can’t run over 5 meters without collapsing on the floor. I’m almost positive she’s going to be the leader, and probably the strongest of them all. Trailblazer’s power is a magical backpack, passed down to her by her grandfather (or something, tell me if that’s wrong in the comments) and now she keeps it and uses it to fight crime. Many people in the Youtube comments have been comparing her to Dora. So yep, that’s her name now. She’s just an obese Dora. Even has the backpack! B-Negative Can’t forget to represent the goths, right? Because that’s the entire point of his character. Apparently one of his quotes is, “The world is a vampire…and so am I…” how edgy and mysterious, right? Exciting, right?! He was exposed to the blood of Michael Morbeus in a life saving procedure, and got his powers. I actually think his backstory is pretty decent, but the fact that he exists only to be a diversity symbol for the goth kids (and possibly trans people? I’m not sure, it’s subtle, but I feel like he might also be there for trans people.) is pretty annoying. I could see B-Negative being one of the more interesting characters in this group, even if he still sucks. Snowflake and Safespace The next two members of the team are twins, Snowflake and Safespace. They tried to have clever names, but really, they just make me wanna facepalm. They’re supposed to rely on each other in battle, and that’s because their powers are pretty opposite. Snowflake is like a glass cannon, from what I’ve seen. Sensitive, and easily hurt, while Safespace can make pink forcefields, but only activate them when protecting somebody. And most likely for the hell of it, Snowflake is non binary. I’m almost convinced that they created these character’s race, gender and sexuality before they made the powers and character traits. Kinda sucks that well-done diversity is hard to come by. Screentime I think he’s actually a white male, by the way. He looked white in all other promotions. Our fifth and last member of the New Warriors is named Screentime, (woohoo, another super clever name.) and here’s his backstory and powers: He is a meme-obsessed teenager who had his brain connected to his internet after being exposed to his grandfather’s… “experimental…internet…gas”?? Now he can see augmented reality and real time maps, and can google any fact… So you’re telling me I can tell him to google “fcdhbsxuadcbosagavsfbycnjg” and he’d just automatically say, “Your search, ‘fcdhbsxuadcbosagavsfbycnjg‘ did not match any results.”? Awesome! So cool! And apparently he’s a know-it-all. I honestly feel like this is an attack on white men on the internet, but I’m not completely positive. I really hate this team. I really do. So there’s our next gang of elite teenagers. Woohoo. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if their villains were named… The Patriarchy, Hate Speech, and the oh so evil Republican Party. This team is basically just twitter, or the internet as a whole. I could think of Trailblazer as Tumblr, Screentime as Reddit, B-Negative as 4chan, and the other two representing Twitter. I honestly hope this entire thing is a whole joke. Hopefully they made to post this on April 1st, right? Right guys?

Additionally, one can also argue that you asking such a question is you also trying you deal with and explain someone's behavior due to your own narcissistic injury that you experienced because of that behavior.

You have a claim ticket which is your proof that you checked a bag, and the CCTV footage helps protect the airport or airline from fraudulent claims. The airlines have insurance to cover lost luggage, but if you read the small print, you’ll see the amount you can expect is not much. The bottom line is that they’d rather pay for insurance than the labor it would take to make the system more secure. On most flights nobody checks. Since everybody gathers around the baggage carousel, the bags get claimed quickly. and most baggage claim areas are only a few feet from the exits.

Every controlled demolition(CD) expert knows that. 9/11 was the second CD and major office fire at World Trade Center. The question is how did each WTC stand through all the construction and after official opening? How were each floor, constructed on top of all floors below down to bedrock foundation, able to stand all the way to completion and for decades after and never once collapse? The engineers and architects that designed it, and the builders who built, know. No builder would ever go up if the WTCs were anything less than marvel. It’s CNN viewers, not CD experts, engineers and architects, who believe the plane and fire story. Each WTC tower is a skyscraper core unseen from the outside. It’s there. A free standing tower, in zero to calm wind, surrounded by concrete pan floors that span to outer perimeter column network, that rise up and held together by a giant hat truss with roof on top. The perimeter and core shelving units hold up the pans, 100+ of them, splitting 50–50 load duty. On 9/11 both cores, huge towers of steel&concrete sitting on bedrock, disappeared in midair. Where’d they go? If the towers stood for ~1 hour after jet damage and internal fire, how’d they collapse an hour or so later? Here’s a house of cards I built on a table and will knock out one card, light a few others on fire, and wait and watch as it falls. Smack away one card, light two, there it is. But it doesn’t fall and the card flames burn out. On 9/11 the house did fall, an ~hour later. A whole ~hour elapsed between impact, damage, fire, these could be called collapse initiators, and final collapse. What happened? The tower marvel perimeter was a screened-in porch. A jet could punch through, as each marvel were built to handle in 100mph hurricane winds and 3-times+ live tower weight load bearing engineered, and the screen would stand. Like cutting a hole with scissors in a framed in door screen will never cause it to collapse from what is wrongly called sympathetic loading. The structural duties of the now missing screen section do not transfer load duty to the surrounding network. They reduce the total load bearing roster by zero significance tiny amount in a building designed to pack the weight of over three towers inside in a hurricane while hit by a jetliner. Not Ikea bookshelf. The heavy steel of jet engines and landing gear could punch into the core and these would make a small hole in a bug screen built to handle. A screened porch surrounded a screened porch of strong material that no jet would be any bother. And no internal fires, as full-scale industrial building fire science has proved, as did top-down raging inferno skyscrapers for hours did after 9/11, would affect the towers. Kill people inside, but not the steel&concrete. Not even the steel pans and their mounts. Each spandrel plate, if fire heat could weaken to failure, along three sides of any floor could fail at once, dropping the floor down on the one below and would contact a semi-rigid bouncy surface and halted by. That’s not what happened on 9/11. Each floor, none ever touched by jet or fire, ceased to be what caused to stand for decades moments before the debris wave arrived at. Each floor ceased being the engineering marvels that they were. This can rule out marvel engineering as the cause. The jets can be ruled out. The fires ruled out.

First, try gentle stretches and exercises that focus on your core muscles and lower back. Gentle Yoga moves have been quite a lifesaver for me. Applying heat or ice can bring relief; experiment to see which works best for you. Maintaining good posture throughout the day is also one of the keys for sure, whether sitting or standing, can make a huge difference too. Invest in a supportive chair if you're at a desk often. Over time, strengthening your back muscles through consistent exercise can help prevent future episodes. Don't hesitate to consult a physical therapist or chiropractor if the pain persists. They can provide personalized guidance and exercises. Remember, everyone's body is different, so be patient and listen to your body's signals as you work toward relief. You can also read my blog post here: [LINKED_TEXT: Top 7 Effective Ways to Ease Consistent Back PainDealing with persistent back pain is no joke, but there’s hope! As someone who’s been down that road, I’ve gathered some effective strategies to help you find relief. So, let’s dive into the top seven ways that have personally worked wonders for me: 1. Stay Active with Gentle Exercises : Believe it or not, movement can be your ally against back pain. Low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or light yoga can help reduce tension and enhance flexibility. Strengthening your core muscles through these activities can significantly alleviate discomfort. 2. Mind Your Posture Everywhere : Remember your grandma’s advice? It’s gold! Maintaining proper posture during activities like sitting and standing can work wonders. Ensure your workspace setup is ergonomic, and consider using a cushion to support your lower back’s natural curve. 3. Heat and Cold Therapy Magic : When your back’s acting up, heat and cold can come to the rescue. For muscle stiffness, a warm shower or a heating pad is my go-to. On the other hand, if inflammation’s the culprit, an ice pack can work its magic. Here is one stretch to stop back pain and Sciatica >> 4. Prioritize Sleep Comfort : A peaceful night’s sleep can be a game-changer. Ensure your mattress offers the right support, and consider snoozing on your side with a pillow between your knees. It’s a simple trick that can make a world of difference in the morning. 5. Don’t Hesitate to Seek Expert Help : Professional advice is like a treasure trove when dealing with consistent back pain. Whether it’s a physical therapist, chiropractor, or orthopedist, their expertise can pinpoint the issue and offer tailored solutions. 6. Stay Hydrated and Eat Right : Hydration and a balanced diet play a role in managing back pain. Drinking enough water and consuming nutrient-rich foods can help maintain healthy muscles and joints. Trust me, it’s a small but impactful step. 7. Practice Stress Relief : Stress can sneakily worsen back pain. Engage in relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy. A calmer mind often leads to a more comfortable back. Bonus Tip: Patience is Key ! Remember, these strategies are about progress, not perfection. Some days will be better than others, and that’s okay. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate each step forward – no matter how small. Now, I’m not a medical professional, but these tips come from real experience and shared knowledge. Your body is unique, so adjust these strategies to what feels best for you. If the pain persists or worsens, it’s wise to consult a healthcare expert. In a nutshell, consistent back pain doesn’t have to dictate your life. By staying active, minding your posture, trying heat/cold therapy, prioritizing sleep, seeking expert help, embracing a healthy lifestyle, and managing stress, you’re on the path to a back-pain-free you.

The sense shift from \\"3 p.m.\\" to \\"12 p.m.\\" began during 12c., and various reasons are given for it, such as unreliability of medieval time-keeping devices and the seasonal elasticity of the hours of daylight in northern regions. In monasteries and on holy days, fasting was ended at nones, which also perhaps was incentive to push it forward. Or perhaps the sense shift was based on an advance in the customary time of the (secular) midday meal. Whatever the cause, the meaning change was complete by 14c.

Why does marriage bring sadness? Why does a person have a hard time getting married? And the answer is that when both husbands and wives forget their faith, deeds, promises, vows, responsibilities, there is grief in the marital relationship. If the two do not maintain their relationship with each other, the relationship will be disrupted and both will sacrifice their happiness.

Now we want to describe the reason why do unhappy couples stay together. They are unhappy in their marriage but are comfortable. A person who is sad in his married life does not mean that he/she is unhappy with his/her partner. Sometimes their condition has worsened and they are in mourning. Could it be that his/her family is having problems with her/his spouse or there are some other reasons for which the person is unhappy in his/her relationship? After a long period, you both living together and you know each other then you definitely feel comfortable with your partner. And a person always needs a place where they feel comfortable. And sometimes they feel sad but never want to leave their marriage. Now, here most people live this type of life. They are worried about how they will fare after the breakup. Most people never want to be free from marriage, even if they are sad at the wedding. Because they have their future in mind that how to make a living after separating from their spouse. It is very difficult to live a single life in today's world. It will work if they don't have a child, but if they have a child, it will be difficult for them to make a living and support their child. So they choose to stay in an unhappy marriage. Being a married couple for a few months or years changes the lives of everyone. They also depend on each other and that is his habit after some days. So it is difficult to change that habit immediately. And also the joys of being with children are not found when they are separated. They worry that the more they suffer in a relationship, the more they will suffer after separation. That’s why a person is staying in an unhappy relationship. For the future of their child. This is the main reason why couples do not want to be separated because they care more about their children's future than theirs. They have all the responsibilities of their kid so they don’t want their children's future to be bad for them. They know that their children feel happy when they see their parents together and these think sometimes make their parents happy. Some parents think that if they are separated then society is criticizing their children in future. So they never think about divorce. It is difficult to live alone today and meet all the needs of the children. And they know that sometimes their children feel their father or mother's absence in their life so they prefer to stay together whatever the situation. Even they also feel guilty in front of their friends in their school and so many problems their children face in their life. In society, their values ​​will be undermined. We all live in a society and this society sometimes encourages us and sometimes despair us. After all, we live in it and we create our name and fame and also our reputation in this community. And it takes a long time to build an identity. So always we want to save our values. So people choose to stay in an unhappy marriage because they would rather be in sorrow than suffer slander. They know that if they are separated then their parents their family members and also their children's are suffered in society and also their dignity will be mixed with the dust. So they are waiting for the right moment when everything getting perfect. Hopefully, everything will be fine again in the future. No one can survive without hope. There are ups and downs in a relationship, and you have to deal with them. If the time is not good now, then we need to be patient and hope that the future will improve.

However, there are some things you should keep in mind if you want to zap your dinner without zapping your health. Firstly, microwaving your food won't necessarily make it less nutritious. In fact, some studies suggest that microwaving vegetables can actually help to preserve their nutrients, as it cooks them quickly and with minimal water. That being said, if you're nuking a frozen pizza every night, you're probably not getting all the nutrients your body needs. Secondly, there is some evidence to suggest that microwaving your food can be harmful if you're using plastic containers or wrap that contain harmful chemicals such as BPA. These chemicals can leach into your food when heated, potentially causing health problems down the line. So, if you must use plastic, make sure it's labeled as microwave-safe and don't let it come into contact with your food for too long. Lastly, if you're the type of person who likes their food piping hot, you might want to reconsider your microwaving habits. Heating your food to extreme temperatures can cause the formation of carcinogenic compounds called acrylamides, which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. So, try to avoid overcooking your food, and make sure it's heated evenly throughout. In conclusion, microwaving your food is not inherently bad for your health, but like anything else, moderation is key. As long as you're mindful of the materials you're using and don't rely on the microwave as your sole source of sustenance, you'll be just fine. And who knows, maybe one day we'll all be cooking gourmet meals in our microwaves - stranger things have happened!"},{"instruction":"Do you agree with environmentalists that keeping dogs or cats is bad for the environment as they leave a large carbon footprint?","output":"I do not.

In this article, we will cover essential concepts and strategies to help you navigate the world of investments. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refine your investment approach, this guide aims to provide valuable insights that can empower your financial journey. One crucial aspect to grasp before diving into investing is inflation. Over time, the cost of goods and services tends to increase, reducing the purchasing power of your money. For instance, if you were to keep £1,000 under your mattress for ten years, its value would diminish due to inflation. However, it's important to note that while inflation affects the prices of goods, it also impacts the value of your savings. Thus, simply stashing money in a savings account can help counterbalance the effects of inflation. To prevent your money from losing value over time, investing becomes an attractive option. While savings accounts and traditional investments may offer minimal returns, there are alternative avenues to pursue. Investing in stocks and shares provides opportunities for both dividend income and capital gains.

Most applicants accept that their CV will be looked into and that the employing administrator will scan that CV for important abilities. Nothing could be farther from the real world. An employing director is possible going to endure 6-10 seconds evaluating the report you submit. Inside that brief time frame, you really want to believe that he/she will distinguish capabilities you have that are pertinent to a task they're attempting to fill. To be best, you want to fit your resume to the particular work, involving the expected set of responsibilities as your aide. Ensure each pertinent watchword from the set of working responsibilities shows up on your resume — utilize striking to feature the catchphrases you secured in the position portrayal. Presently, the employing director will see immediately the applicable capabilities you have, on the grounds that you've featured his own watchwords. That gets our advantage. At the point when the catchphrases I'm searching for are covered knee somewhere down in other unessential capabilities, you have a very nearly ZERO possibility getting a require a meeting.

Giving yourself the permission to accept this fact will create a fire in your belly to explore more about it.  Explore it Ask yourself these questions – o What did I want yourself to be as I was growing up? o If I had limited time to live, what would I definitely want to achieve? o If I had all the money in the world, what would I do with my time? o What make me very happy? o What do I hate most about life? o Who is my role model and why? o What engrosses me so much that I loose track of time? o What do I want to be remembered as? o What am I grateful for? The answers to these questions will point out to things that are most important to you and help you move closer to your life’s purpose.  Think from your heart While your head can help you take the most rational decisions, happiness is where the heart is. When you try to look for your life’s purpose from your heart, you naturally look for things that evokes passion and joy and find a purpose that is worth living for.  Embrace life as it comes Purpose gives you a constant sense of fulfilment and achievement. When you live purposefully, you live every single moment in absolute joy and give it your best, no matter what it brings. This can only happen when you embrace life as it comes with all its risks, challenges and newness, and stop resisting anything about it. When you feel connected with every aspect of life and are in complete alignment with it, your purpose gets fulfilled on its own.  Cultivate gratitude Researchers suggest that when we feel grateful for our blessings, we are able to observe how others are working to making our lives better. In this way, we also tend to contribute to the world beyond us and live a life of purpose. Cultivating gratitude is thus an excellent way to live a purposeful life.  Go inwards Bring deep breathing and meditation into daily practice so that you are more conscious and connected with your inner-self.

The 10,000 subscriber milestone is one of the major ones. However, how did you get this many subscribers to your channel? I will help you clarify in this answer. Rarely do content producers acquire 10,000 YouTube subscribers. Since this is the case, many people have this milestone on their list of objectives. Fortunately, if the right actions are performed, this milestone can be accomplished. How to obtain 10,000 YouTube followers is as follows: ConsistencyHard workHave a constructive attitudeProduce only top-notch contentBe patient Let's examine this procedure in greater depth. Consistency Look at the most popular YouTube channels. What do all of them share? You'll probably notice that they're all remarkably consistent throughout time. You'll also need to maintain consistency if you want to go to 10,000 subscribers. Consistency doesn't just relate to adding fresh videos to your channel. Additionally, it pertains to making videos, developing talents, and promoting your channel. Simply said, you have to come in and work every day. Being consistent won't be a problem for you if you enjoy the process of producing content and expanding your audience. However, if you do not enjoy the process of creating material, you may find it difficult to be consistent, which may cause problems in the future. Hard work Many people who watch videos on YouTube think that making and uploading videos is simple. In practice, the procedure is time-consuming and occasionally challenging. This means that a creative must be willing to put in a lot of effort if they want to get to 10,000 subscribers. Here's the deal: adding additional videos to your YouTube channel is the simplest approach to expand your following. Uploading more movies will enable more views to be acquired more quickly, which can hasten the expansion of the audience. However, a content creator needs to work harder in order for more videos to be uploaded. Naturally, it might be argued that a creator's ability to reach 10K YouTube subscribers will increase with their level of effort. Given this, making an effort and working hard must be a top priority. Have a constructive attitude The minds of content producers are a significant barrier to reaching 10K members. In essence, when their videos don't do well, many producers dig themselves deeper. This will only lead to disaster. You need to think positively if your goal is to get 10,000 YouTube subscribers. This is crucial since having an optimistic outlook will enable you to persevere when circumstances don't turn out as expected. You'll find it difficult to make and upload videos if you let yourself fall into a negative frame of mind. The process will take longer and be more challenging. You'll eventually give up since doing everything that helps your channel develop will become a hassle. Produce only top-notch content Good videos are the main draw of YouTube for users. Because of this, you must produce engaging videos if you want to expand your audience. In other words, you have to produce top-notch content. The value offered determines the quality of the content, not the recording technology. A video will be considered to be of low quality if it does not offer viewers any enjoyment or educational value. You must make it your goal to offer value through your videos when you produce them. By doing this, you'll improve the likelihood that someone will subscribe to your channel since they'll find your videos to be interesting, instructive, and/or helpful. Be patient To succeed on YouTube, one needs develop a wide range of talents. As you might have guessed, developing the necessary abilities takes time. Therefore, it takes time for any content provider to reach the 10,000 subscriber mark. It's also critical to understand that you might follow all the appropriate steps and yet see subscriber churn. Even with excellent thumbnails and carefully optimized movies, growth can be sluggish. This is the reality of trying to increase your YouTube audience. Ultimately, all you can do is set your channel for success by doing everything you can to make it successful. You must then exercise patience. Just keep in mind that if your channel is expanding slowly, it doesn't necessarily indicate that you're doing something incorrectly; growth takes time. And of course to be successful in this job then 10,000 is not a number you should aim for, it may be the first step but if you want to grow then you have to give a higher number. This is a field that is no longer strange to us, many people have succeeded and become rich from here. This is also one of the high-income skills that are applied a lot in this era. What you need is creativity, curiosity, good expression and most importantly, always listen and respect your fans. To do that, aside from your creative or expressive talents, you need to find and learn a YouTuber training course (I have one) where they will teach you what it takes to be successful and of course mistakes to avoid in the process. YouTube is the second most popular website behind Google with 1.7 billion monthly visitors. Compared to Facebook, Instagram, and even Amazon, it receives more visitors. The potential to build your channel is therefore enormous, even if you are just getting started. So don't wait and miss the opportunity to get rich as well as your passion.

The former can take infrastructure burdens off their shoulders and commit to developing the core product. Product owners, at the same time, reduce server running costs and achieve increased service scalability, speed to market, and scalability. But like other innovative technologies, serverless is a double-edged sword that can stab your development processes in the back. Therefore, choose wisely based on your application specifics, business needs, and established workflow. If we look past the hype, it becomes clear that this technology has its drawbacks and limitations. There are some cases when it makes more sense, both from a financial and a technical perspective, to use dedicated servers that are either self-managed or provided as a service. In particular, using serverless is not your smartest move in the following scenarios: Low latency apps A dedicated cloud server has your code all set when an event arrives. As a result, the event can be processed within milliseconds. Serverless architecture slows down the processing time, taking hundreds of milliseconds before the event is attended to. Memory-intensive applications Each cloud platform operates with limited CPU, memory, disk, and I/O resources. For example, AWS Lambda functions can go on for a maximum of five minutes and are limited to 1.5 GB of memory.This makes serverless unsuitable for storage-intensive applications. Moreover, serverless architecture deprives control over server hardware, runtimes, and runtime updates and imposes concurrency. This means that the provider can influence the core characteristics of your software architecture. For instance, if you go serverless with AWS Lambda, you are tied to two serverless-esque databases which are DynamoDB or Serverless Aurora. So, if you want to avoid vendor lock-in, you should consider other options. However, you can alleviate some of the serverless disadvantages by applying a mixed approach. It means using a server that will take over ongoing processes while farming out time- and process-consuming tasks to serverless."},{"instruction":"What are the necessary documents to monetize a YouTube channel?","output":"To monetize a YouTube channel, you will need to meet certain eligibility criteria and provide certain information to YouTube.

The big companies have huge cash resources and realize that so much cash is a blessing and a curse. Owning a big financial services firm includes the sweet fringe benefit of having some new members of the executive team who are very sophisticated players in global finance, experts in M&A and much more savvy about the current financial scene. Those people are very hard to recruit as employees but are almost “free” with the purchase of a small regional banking outfit, or a second tier credit card company. So in conclusion, in addition to bringing some financial and operational diversity into the family you also get some smart people to plug into your board of directors or senior management."},{"instruction":"Why do grocery stores allow dogs in their business and don't object when small dogs ride in grocery carts?

Each of us will have a different perspective on this issue. In my opinion, the most dangerous thing on Earth is human greed. Why? Photo credit to owner. Because of greed, one must think of how to possess others’ benefits. One will not hesitate to do anything to come out on top. Because of greed, one might lose his morality. Thus, one might commit wrongdoings. Take China as an example. Due to moral corruption, the food safety in this country has probably become one of the worst on this planet (even though the regime claims to the contrary.) The 2008 Melamine milk scandal in China hospitalized tens of thousands of children for consuming contaminated milk. Some infants suffered severely from kidney stones and other kidney damage. Six babies lost their lives. A baby receives medical treatment at a hospital in China on September 14, 2008. (Photo: Reuters) On the contrary, there are people who easily find happiness in small things. A sunbeam in the morning, a fresh breeze,... Some find joy in giving away to others. “Komorebi” [koh-moh-ray-bee]: A Japanese word that describes the beautiful moment when sunlight filters through the leaves on the trees. (Photo: Twitter/@neasg) For those people, their happiness might be humble, but it’s for sure that they possess it. What about you? What is the most dangerous thing to you?

First, the prior owner should have disclosure the house was part of an HOA to the new buyer. Many people don’t like being part of an HOA and they might not have purchased the property if they had known. My wife and I recently purchases some acreage in an HOA. Both the listing and the realtor informed us of the HOA. Once we signed the contract, we notified the HOA of our intent to purchase and requested assess to several documents. The HOA mailed us a USB drive with all the documents we requested. We examined the HOA documents including the CC and Rs, building and landscaping regulations, the balance sheet, income statement for the last 3 years and their 5 year plan. Online access would have been acceptable also. We also did a search for any lawsuits past and pending against the HOA. After the review, we had a couple of concerns and asked the HOA for clarification which we got before completing the purchase. Purchasing in a HOA with financial or governing problems is usually a big mistake. Hiding the fact the the house is in an HOA is a sufficiently large disclosure failure to enable the buyer to cancel the sale. Second, a competent realtor will know the property is in an HOA and should reveal that to the buyers. Not informing the buyers borders on incompetence or potentially fraud. Third, any semi-competent title company should have found the HOA restriction on the deed. Most realtor use a local title company and they should also know what properties are likely to be in an HOA. They also should have notified the HOA of the sale and in most states, the HOA is then required to send a copy of all HOA documents which are presented at closing. It is a bit hard to believe that any sale got all the way to closing without disclosure of an HOA, but I’ve seen some stranger things."},{"instruction":"w hard was it for ancient civilizations to invent the wheel?","output":"Harder than you’d think. While the wheel shows up in pop culture as the first or easiest invention, it was really relatively late. Fire and stone tools had already been around for millions of years, agriculture and domesticated animals had already been developed, and metallurgy was coming along. The wheel, as transportation, appears to have been invented once [1] somewhere in the general vicinity of southwestern Asia and spread out from there. Despite what pop culture says, developing the wheel isn’t that easy. There are likely a number of conditions necessary to make it viable (availability of draft animals, terrain which works well as a surface for driving on) before anybody’s going to develop all of the parts (axle, wheel, bearings) and bring them together. The wheel was also invented at some point in Mesoamerica, but was never adopted as transport.

It is the type of restrictions which makes it different from other kinds of representative democracies. The United States of America started out with many restrictions on voting rights and citizenship, and excluded the vast majority of its adult population. This changed over time, but within the class of citizens able to vote, there usually are no requirements other than legal adult age. The Federation was formed as a world unifying government, and had a specific goal to ensure that its citizens and government would only include people who volunteered to serve the population of the nation. Anyone who volunteered for Federal Service and completed one two year term would be granted citizenship, and could vote and hold public office. Federal service includes many things, mostly not military combat service. But it always includes basic military training, and as a volunteer, if a war or disaster or other emergency requires dangerous work or combat, you have to do it. Or else, resign, and give up your chance to become a voting citizen. It shares some ideas in common with modern nations which implement universal conscription, which have the expectation that most adult citizens will have spent some time in service practicing to defend their country. Except that instead of demanding that it's citizens “volunteer”, the Federation makes it a choice. Those who choose Service are presumed to be more likely to be good public representatives when elected, and responsible informed voters, rather than unfocused ignorant slackers. Because the book focuses on a group of soldiers during a war, we don't see much of the civilian side of the government. We do know that no active military service members may vote or hold public office, as they only can be Citizens after completing service. Other than the citizenship requirement, we get little hint that the government is repressive or unresponsive to the desires and needs of the whole population, citizens and non citizens alike. All have American style civil rights, can own businesses, property, and live pretty much as they please, within the law."},{"instruction":"FLAC as good as WAV?","output":"I like FLAC better because it can be losslessly compressed - same quality for a smaller size.

And although it took him a hell of a long time to sail to the South Pacific and back, Noah did. And God said get two Cardinals while you’re at it.

And God said, just get, like, 7 or 8 and you should be fine. So Noah did. And God said while you’re coming back from the South Pole, do a stopover in South East Asia and get two of each Asian hornet. And at this, Noah paused and slowly said: “But don’t those nasty fuckers deliver neurotoxins that can, like, totally kill inoocent people? And isn’t Your Almighty plan here to rid the world of evil?

Cheers, Richard"},{"instruction":"What is rent seeking? Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","output":"This is one of many terms in economics that means something different than its normal English meaning. In English, rent means a periodic payment for a physical good—an apartment, a car, a tuxedo, etc. There is nothing wrong with that. Economist David Ricardo defined “rent” as payment beyond what is required to keep a factor of production in current use. This differs from normal English in two ways. First, it applies to all factors of production, including payment for labor (which in English we usually refer to as wages or salary rather than rent) and other services. Second it is only the excess, not the full payment. So if you rent your apartment for 1,000 per month, but the landlord would be willing to keep renting it to you for any amount above 900, the Ricardian rent is 100, not 1,000. Ricardian rent is not necessarily wrong, but you have to inquire the reason for it. If it results from arms-length negotiation between two parties, then it’s fine. But if it results from some illicit force—say racial discrimination or laws favoring one party or the other—it’s bad. Economist Anne Krueger in 1974 introduced the term “rent seeking” to refer to people seeking benefits from politics. This is Ricardian rent in the sense that people seek to be paid for goods or services at above the market rate. They want no-bid contracts to supply the government overpriced goods, or cushy no-work jobs or consulting gigs, or special tax breaks, or their competition to be handicapped, or an infinite number of other schemes. Of course, not everyone agrees what behavior is rent-seeking. A lobbyist working to impose regulation on an industry will probably claim she is trying to protect the public and improve quality, while others will say she is trying to get rules that will increase profits for her clients at the expense of the public and competitors. A teachers’ union negotiator will say he is trying to get a fair deal for teachers in the best interests of everyone, while others will say he is trying to trade teachers’ votes and union dues to corrupt politicians for sweetheart contracts."},{"instruction":"What's better, Alibaba or Amazon?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Amazon ] [URL: https://alpharepricer.com/blogs/category/amazon/]is the number one online retailer amongst eCommerce businesses globally. Each month more than 198 million people visit [LINKED_TEXT: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more] [URL: http://amazon.com/]. In 2018, Amazon’s share of the U.S eCommerce market was 41% (source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]-2018). Furthermore, it has maintained its rank in the market by enabling customers to trust its services and products. During the Covid Pandemic, a huge increase in the eCommerce market was observed. According to the Forbes report: “Amazon sales increased over 100 billion, making it one of the highest profit makers and successful retailers in the eCommerce marketplace” (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Forbes] [URL: http://forbes.com/]-2020) Alibaba is a platform that connects different buyers and sellers across the globe. This company offers B2B (Business to Business), C2C (Consumer To Consumer), and B2C (Business to Consumer) services. Last year, it was ranked as the fifth-largest artificial intelligence company. The initial goal of Alibaba was to develop a platform for Chinese consumers to solve their issues and provide quality products, but later it expanded its services worldwide. The overall sales of Alibaba vs. Amazon in the fiscal year 2020 The overall market capitalization of the successful and most extensive online retailer Amazon is USD 1,662 billion, which is twice the overall market capitalization of Alibaba (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]). Moreover, Alibaba is planning to expand into many other marketplaces. It provides various platforms to its consumers, including Taobao, Tmall, Alibaba, AliExpress, and Alibaba cloud. “The Taobao contributes 80% to the overall sales of the giant retailer Alibaba”. (Source:[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://www.ecommercefuel.com/alibaba-vs-amazon/]eCommerce fuel-2020) Basically, Taobao enables more significant and successful brands to sell the products directly to customers to achieve high sales and profit. Alibaba looks successful and profitable, but this company faces enormous challenges in finding new customers and adapting to new economies. (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]-2020) Due to the pandemic last year, many people shifted towards online shopping, which contributed to the overall sales of Alibaba. This graph shows the overall revenue of Alibaba. In 2020, Alibaba achieved whopping sales of 509.7 billion yuan. (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]-2020) Amazon is also the most widely used online retailer globally, providing thousands of opportunities to new sellers. Last year, Amazon broke all the records and became the most successful online retailer with a total net sale of 125.56 billion (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]-2020) (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Statista - The Statistics Portal] [URL: http://statista.com/]-2020) In the above graph, Amazon sales are increasing drastically in the Q4-2020, making it the most successful online retailer across the world. Key differences between Alibaba and Amazon These giant platforms are playing a significant role in the world of eCommerce businesses. Let’s have a look at the key differences between Amazon and Alibaba. · Business models The business model of Amazon is unique, which gives plenty of opportunities to the sellers entering into the market. Amazon sells products directly to its customers. Furthermore, customers can buy the products from third-party retailers. This platform is much more developed than Alibaba. Amazon offers many services to its consumers, such as fast shipping, Amazon Prime, Amazon FBA, and many significant web services. To increase its overall sales, Amazon charges its sellers for every completed sale. “More than 50% of Amazon’s marketplace sales come from third-party sellers”. (Source: feedback [LINKED_TEXT: Men's and Women's Clothing] [URL: http://express.com/]-2020) On the other hand, the business model of Alibaba is pretty affordable. It operates multiple businesses such as Aliexpress, Taobao, Taobao Mall, and Alibaba cloud. The most popular one is [LINKED_TEXT: 淘宝网(淘寶網)] [URL: http://taobao.com/] that is called a fee-free marketplace for all the sellers and consumers. Moreover, Taobao offers many opportunities to the new sellers to start their business. Whereas Taobao Mall sells products of the more prominent brands such as Apple, Nike, etc. “Alibaba made a huge contribution in the eCommerce market in China back in 2019“.(Source:[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://mywifequitherjob.com/alibaba-vs-amazon/]mywifequitherjob-2019) · Expansion of eCommerce businesses Amazon leads the online marketplace. There are various aspects of this platform that made the growth possible. Since its establishment, it has expanded its business to many international markets across the world. This huge platform is second to none because it believes in building the trust and satisfaction of customers across the globe. Currently, Amazon offers 17 marketplaces including: USUKSwedenItalyNetherlandsJapanSingaporePolandGermanyMexicoFranceIndiaUAEChinaSaudi ArabiaTurkeySpain Alibaba has only 19 regional centres globally, including China NorthChina SouthSingaporeChina EastAustraliaMalaysiaMiddle EastU.S. WestU.S. EastIndiaIndonesiaEuropeHong KongAustraliaJapanMiddle EastUKSpainGermany Moreover, Alibaba has launched new features for its U.S based sellers to earn more sales and profit! But we cannot ignore the important fact that Amazon is better at expanding its business out of its native market to maximize their sales and profit! (Source: eCommerce fuel) · Services Amazon provides outstanding services to its merchants, such as fulfillment by Amazon through which sellers send their items to Amazon, Amazon then picks, packs, and delivers those products to its customers. Moreover, it offers Amazon Prime Services to its premium members, including video streaming, Amazon original T.V. shows, playlists, and millions of songs. However, Alibaba does not offer such services, which narrows its market share. · Inventory Alibaba acts as a middleman between the sellers and buyers in the eCommerce market. It does not own the inventory of the merchandise sold. However, Amazon owns the stock and sells the products directly to its customers. Moreover, Amazon has its warehouses where they store the inventory and then ship the products to their customers · Profitability ratio Alibaba performs much better in terms of earning profit. Alibaba has higher profit margins, and it sells more stuff as compared to the giant retailer Amazon. The profit of Alibaba in 2019 is 23.3% beating the online retailer Amazon that has a profit margin of only 4.1%. (Source:[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://mywifequitherjob.com/alibaba-vs-amazon/]mywifequitherjob -2019) “We want to help small businesses to grow by resolving their issues through the Internet technology”. -Jack Ma of Alibaba (source: eCommerce fuel) Who will be the future eCommerce leader? The competition is really tough. Alibaba is the undisputed and successful leader in the Chinese market, whereas Amazon has the highest market share in the European countries. Both lead the online eCommerce marketplaces. It is hard to decide the winner between these two giant platforms. In the future, it is expected that Alibaba will bring more products into the market and will increase its expansion into other marketplaces. Hence, it is also forecasted that Amazon will bring new services and products in the future for its customers to skyrocket their sales and lead the online market. Conclusion Amazon and Alibaba have changed the game of the eCommerce market. Beside this, they both have built their brand solid and successful. Moreover, they have gained customer satisfaction across the globe. These platforms will continue to grow and lead as more buyers shift to shopping for products online.

They want to know why you are they way you are but don’t judge. (Well, they’ll judge you if it doesn’t make logical sense) it’s a strange kind of peace. You can be yourself around an Intp, no judgement, no drama, no passive aggressive manipulation.

Each myocyte consists of many tubular threads called myofibrils. Each myofibril consists of repeat contractile units called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere consists of a thick filament myosin and a thin filament actin. When skeletal muscle cells receive efferent impulses from the cerebellum/motor cortex in the brain neurotransmitters are released via temporal/spacial summation and bind to receptors on a muscle cell causing Ca2+ ions to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These Ca2+ ions bind to Ca2+ binding sites on troponin causing it to move. This causes tropomyosin to move which exposes myosin binding sites on the actin. ADP and P(i) are then released from myosin causing it to change shape and nod forward before binding to the myosin binding sites on the actin, forming cross bridges. The actin then slides over the myosin (resulting in contraction). ATP then attaches to the myosin, causing it to detach from the actin. ATPase on the myosin head then hydrolyses ATP to ADP and P(i) causing myosin to return to its original upright position. Therefore, the function of a skeletal muscle cell (myocyte) is to contract when it receives efferent impulses from the somatic nervous system, allowing voluntary movement. Epithelial tissue is composed of epithelial cells ( protective, absorptive, or secretory) which lie on the surface of the hollow cavities, organs, and blood vessels within the body. Ciliated epithelial cells (protective epithelial cells) line the trachea and bronchi of the lungs, the sperm duct in males and the uterus and oviduct in females. Their function is to move the mucus produced by the goblet cells (which traps bacteria and viruses, thus producing the epithelium and the structure it surrounds) via ciliogenesis/the beating of motile cilia, to prevent a build up of harmful substances, thus protecting the internal structure..."},{"instruction":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","output":"My adult life in pictures, aged 18 to 49 In 1985. Age 18, taken at my high school prom. I was very optimistic. About to start college. Working at a travel agency where I just was made “General Manager” of my department. Finally, FINALLY, growing out of my adolescent awkwardness and earning some friends and attention from guys. You can’t see him, but my prom date was cute. 1987. Age 20, a junior in college. Recently hired as a part-time documentation assistant at Microsoft, making 10 an hour. (Minimum wage was 3.35 an hour.) Just discovered long-distance bicycling which was to be a major hobby of mine for awhile. Still rocking. 1992. Age 25. I was very hung over in this photo. I was working at a direct mail ad agency and taking ad school classes in the evenings. Preparing for my future, which was mainly a career. In 1994. Age 27, when I got my first big break in advertising. In a few years, I was working on the campaign voted one of the top 10 “best Seattle commercials of all time.” Wasn’t too worried about any other aspects of my life. No marriage prospects but plenty of dates. In 1997. Age 30, home visiting after moving to San Francisco the previous summer. I was working at a world-class agency, more TV commercials. In 2000. Age 33, before going out to the clubs. Party years! I’d broken up with my long-term boyfriend because he wasn’t “the one,” and still working hard. 2004. Age 37. Temporarily overweight, sick, eyebrowless, unhappy. Between this and the other pic, I’d met and been dumped by the love of my life, moved back to Seattle to live with my parents, developed a serious illness. But still working!! My health care career started in 2004. 2008. Age 41, growing my hair — and eyebrows — back. It turned really dark, for some reason. Single as single could be. Still working in health care, economy be damned. 2010. Age 43, attempted duckface, taken before one of many online dates. Singlehood was getting old, at this point. But I had purchased a house three years previous, which you can sort of see in this photo. Three bedroom, three and a half baths, which I was hoping to fill with a family. Didn’t exactly happen. In 2015. Age 48, with my Quora fleece. I’d finally met a guy and was in a happy relationship. Still in the same house. BF had his own, in another town. At this point, my health was still good and my hair is hanging on, just barely, to its natural color. In 2016. Age 49, taken on a camping trip . Body is starting to break down, knee and hip pain are making my daily 7-mile walks less of a pleasure. BF and I are spending less and less time together; my dream of marriage at 50 isn’t going to happen. Summer of 2018. Single now, but dating is not so bad. I’d heard that lots of men around my age prefer older women to 30-somethings because we tend to be too old to have kids, and are not in a mad rush to start a family. My knees are still bothering me but I’m not putting away my hiking boots anytime soon. Four years don’t seem so long when you’re my age. I think I looked best between the years of 30–35. Still feel like the same old me, except with less energy and slightly more wisdom. And weight."},{"instruction":"What is the future tense of teach?","output":"There is no future forms of any verb.

I’m exhausted with therapy although I have a good therapist, I feel I failed or can’t control my behavior so what’s the point. What to do?","output":"I get it. That’s one of the horrible features of depression. It saps your energy. It drains your will power. It makes you feel like total crap and sometimes even makes you think you are total crap, worthless, no good for anybody, including yourself. It is very hard to control your behavior, especially things like getting your depressed ass out of the house, much less getting to your therapy appointment. Totally understandable. What to do? Above all, accept the truth that this is temporary, even if it seems like forever. You will not always be like this, and most likely you will be fully functional in the near future (even if you are somewhat moody). That’s a scientific fact.Do something, anything. Go outdoors. Walk to some destination, maybe a store, and buy something, anything, a pencil or a pack of Tic Tacs. Walk home by a different route. If you see any dogs or cats or squirrels, say hello to them, out loud if you have privacy. You’ll probably want to ignore any humans.Call any crisis line. Even if it feels like a bunch of bullshit to you, there is some volunteer there who will feel useful if you let them talk with you.I know you are totally exhausted and have zero energy, but even so clean up the few dishes you left in the sink, and make sure the cat’s water bowl is full, and if you can find the power force yourself to change your clothes, at least your shirt or top.Even though you feel like a worthless failure, there are people who care about you because they are friends or relatives, or just because you are in pain and suffering and they are caring people.. Do them a favor and let them feel useful and tell them how awful you feel and ask them to take you somewhere beautiful outdoors, talking optional. Of course I am just taking guesses at who and how you are and what might get you interest off yourself even a little bit during this awful episode, I do have an idea what bad depression feels like, and I don’t know you, but I really want to help, so here’s my attempt. And the first step, remember, is doing something, anything. Brush your teeth. Good. Take a shower. Better. Go somewhere, on a bike or on foot, or on a pogo stick, just go! Your brain is messing with you, but you can still control your motor functions."},{"instruction":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time? Who's to blame?","output":"Because hindsight doesn’t work with the present. Jordan was a great college player and everyone thought he was destined for a great pro career. But no one thought Jordan was going to be the GOAT. I don’t think anyone thought that Jordan was going to be a consistent 25 ppg scorer, let alone the GOAT. In 1984, the playing philosophy of every NBA team was that both offense and defense started with your center. Offensively, you pounded it into your center for “easy” two footers. You shot jumpshots or drove to the basketball to keep the defense honest or to take the pressure off your center for a play. But if you had a good center, everything went through him. Defense was more of a team concept, but your center was the last line of defense; you had to have an intimidating force anchoring your defense to make teams think twice about driving to the basket. In Olajuwon, you had one of the most physically intimidating centers to come out of college since, well, the year before with Ralph Sampson, but before that, you had to go back to Bill Walton ten years earlier. He was underdeveloped offensively, but with his athleticism, the belief was that his offensive game would catch up quickly to his devastating defensive game. It was almost a no-brainer to pick Hakeem no. 1. It’s the choice at no. 2 that draw more questions. The Trailblazers had been good, but not great. They had Mychal Thompson at center (Klay’s dad) and he was one of the best players on the team. But he wasn’t great and we was a little undersized (he later won a couple of championships as the Lakers’s backup power forward). Perhaps most importantly, the Blazers had picked Clyde Drexler the year before and Clyde played the same position as Jordan. So the Blazers went with Sam Bowie. He’d been touted as the best player in the country going back to his high school days (along with Sampson), but he’d mostly been a disappointment while at Kentucky, due primarily to injury (he missed two seasons). Coming into the draft, the Blazers focused on the potential of Bowie instead of the proven ability of Jordan. Terrible, terrible choice. Admittedly this is hindsight, but Bowie had never been that great and as great as Clyde would become, he never became Jordan. Even if you have a good, young SG/SF already, I think you have to take a long look at the CPOY, particularly given what Jordan showed in college versus what Clyde had shown."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"Not at all.

Look up “critical thinking skills “ online and do things that teach you critical thinking. Birth control is 100% your responsibility and 100% your partners responsibility. Yes. 200%, every single time. Zero exceptions. Abstinence doesn't work. Pull and pray doesn't work. Hanging your coochie out to drain doesn't work. Nobody owes you anything. It's all on you to learn how to feed, clothe and house yourself. Plan for this to happen starting on your 18th birthday and consider any assistance after that day as a favor. Learn to cook from scratch. Set a goal to learn ten things you can make from flour, eggs and milk. You'll discover that you need a few other pantry staples like salt, pepper, baking powder and maybe sugar, oh and yeast. From there one or two additional things and you can make real food. No job is beneath you. You don't have to stay in the lowest job. Look for ways to learn more. Look for more experienced people to talk to about how to build your dreams. Be kind. Don't spout off.

The reasons for taking up gate were given in the other answers… Here I would like to write whatever that is left out…. Contents of this answer…. Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think ofStudy Techniques I have used during preparationRevision Techniques I have used during preparationWays to tackle Test SeriesWays to tackle previous year questionHow to incorporate standard text books during preparation Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think of Aptitude :- Aptitude in GATE not so difficult compared to exams like CAT and other. There will be about 10 questions of aptitude, a normal student would able to attempt around 9 questions find and might feel little hurtle to attempt one question but, with little consistent practice you would be able to attempt that one question also. What to with respective aptitude…This is not just my advise, it a common statement from all the toppers to dedicate 1hr for aptitude from day 1 of your preparation until the exam day.If you think you are great with aptitude during your last days of preparation you can think of practicing alternative days.Make sure you solve all the previous year papers. Mathematics :- I am from mechanical background so, from my perspective I can break down this subject into 2 distinct categories.Common preparation point about mathSome problems might be easy focus on the tougher ones the one which you fail. practice all the problems at least twice. If you got the answer still skeptical about the topic please go back and understand the topic.No matter how fearful about math you are math itself would constitute majority of the weightage in gate so, in no way you can ignore it must and should you should learn.If you find the model typical make sure you try to tinker the values given in the question and play around with the problem and make yourself comfortable with the problem concept. Engineering Mathematics consists of linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability statistics. These three subjects are common for many branches of engineering not just computer science so if you open previous year papers of computer science you would find around 300 to 500 problems in Linear algebra and calculus and 300 problems in probability alone so all together around 1000 problems.Learn the concept then practice previous year problems, by practicing the previous year problems for these three subjects would be enough since, for Mechanical and civil people the questions would asked in depth. Discrete Mathematics consists of Graph Theory, Set theory, Propositional Logic and CombinatoricsGraph Theory learning the concept and doing previous paper is a must, the question is asked for chromatic number of regular graph of 6 vertices (K6) you would get the answer but please don't leave the problem there, you yourself take the remaining type of graphs and adapt the question. like…..what is chromatic number of circular graph?….what is chromatic number of wheel graph?….what is chromatic number of bipartite graph?……I would like explore the question this way and take the given values to its minimum and maximum and explore and understand the concept especially for graph theory. Make sure you practice previous year question twice in graph theory.Set Theory one of the easiest subject, relation is most scoring part, don't ignore lattices dedicate special time for lattices so that if a question comes from lattices you should not miss it. Practice previous year questions twice from set theory also.Propositional Logic In no way you should miss this chapter, because no matter how tough the question is everyone who so ever is writing gate will never leave a question from this topic. In fact, this chapter don't need any lectures also. You just need lot of practice in this topic. The more you practice this topic the better you get at it. As usually practice the previous question paper twice. This particular chapter our lectures have taught us as way of solving the question by disproving the options rather than searching for the right option. This kind of approach really works.Combinatorics There is lot of scope to ask tricky questions here. The only way is to tackle the topics from this subject is to segregate them.1. De-arrangement 2.Combinations 3.Permutations 4.Combinations with repetitions5.Permutations with repetitions6.pigeon hole principle 7.functions8.many more minute topicsAs I am concerned, if I was able to segregate the problem to which topic this belong to then I would try to solve the problem with the concerned formula. Most of the time I usually get the right answer Digital Logic :- Don’t even dare to loose a mark in this subject (if the model is repeated).Counters is the most stressed topic.Remember the circuits of half adder and full adders and other important, you should be able to draw them when ever requiredPractice more than 20 problems of K mapDon’t ignore digital codes and conversions (BCD, grey..etc…)Most tricky part is 2′ complement. Computer Organization and Architecture I have no idea why all computer science people consider it as most difficult topic. For me its a fun oneRead Carl Hamcher for each topic. Line by Line and understand the way in which the author is looking at the subjectPipeline and cache is the most important chapters, I would ask you to do previous paper at least a 5 times from Pipeline and cache.When it comes to secondary memories, be sure you are using right formula and your calculations are rightInstructions and addressing modes read it as many times as possible you will get a grasp of itRemember, if a hard problem is given from this topic, its not just tough for you, its tough for AIR 1 too.. Programming in one word pointers.. pointer it is pointers… pointer… pointer… are you hearing me or not ….. pointers it is….Solve as many problems as possible from pointersThis is only subject you need to use your computer for. Don’t just solve the problem on paper. You should code the same exact thing in the computer and make sure you are getting the same output there.Would like to listen to a cheat code here, I am giving you the best cheat code for this subject, If you have good IDE for C you are most welcome to debug the code, keeping track of live variables and checking is your working on the paper matching with debugging.Recursion is place where tricky question are given, 30% of people won’t attempt it and 30% would get the answer wrong So, I think you know which part of percentage you are suppose to be …..In the final exam, I am in the 30% which you got the answer wrong, I made a mistake in indirect recursion I got AIR 7 if I would have made this question right I would have been AIR 3 … So, now you know what kind of questions are game changers….. Data Structures Practice problem a lot … from this chapter it’s not only for GATE, I would be useful for Interviews too..Stacks and queues… you need to be well versed with the code. There are many standard questions with respective stacks and queues you need have those questions on finger tips.Binary Tree…. rather than remember the formulas try to take examples and disprove the options given in the question.Make sure what is being asked is itBinary TreeSkewed Binary TreeComplete Binary TreeFull Binary TreeBinary Search TreeHeapMin HeapMax HeapAVL TreeThere is a lot of difference between all of these.. most of the time mistakes are made like, if asked binary tree in the question we would interpret as binary search tree… Be sure you are answering what is asked for…Graphs… Have a great clarity on DFS and BFS … you need to know differences,code and applications of DFS and BFS… there are hundreds of questions that can formed only with these two topics. Algorithms even though this one of the subject you need to be good at I am not well equipped with the subject So, I would only write about what I knowMake a cheat sheet of time complexitiesWhen ever you are reading about a standard algorithm… make sure you are in a position to analyse about time and space complexitiesWhen questions are given based on notations make sure you don’t miss them …. those can be the easiest questions from this topic.Dynamic programming is not just for GATE, its highly required for Interview.Minimum Cost Spanning Tree and shortest path are such topics which is appearing in every year GATE paper. Not understanding and not practicing it will be a blunder.Practice more… Corman seamed little high standard for a mechanical guy like so I followed everything from sahani. Theory of Computation Overall Idea about this subject is highly important. When a question is given in this area you should be able to distinguish boil it down to the specific sub sub topic it belongs to, either DFA or DCFL or CFL or CSL or Recursive or TM, Segregating which particular sub concept the question paper setter is trying to touch itself is a game changer.Construction of DFA is a must (this is one of the easiest topic In which I lost marks I am not proud of it).Differentiation of CFL and DCFL … have a great clarity on it.There is nothing more important that closure properties…. I will give you another cheat code here…. Instead of remembering what all closure properties hold for what all languages…. Insted remberWhat are closed for all langsWhat are not closed for all langsWhat are not closed for regularsWhat are closed for DCFLwhat are not closed for CFLwhat are not closed for RecursiveWhat are not closed for REL Undecidable read it from peter Lintz, remember standard problems of undecidablility…Have a matrix for each lang(y axis) and each problem (x-axis) and filling decidability or undecidablity in the cells.If you want to dig deeper have a fine distinction of Recursive, Semi decidable and Not REL’sFor turing machine and halting turing machine, remember all the problems … In exam under pressure you might get confused. If you have understood well enough you can solve it in the exam. Pumping lemma… people ignored it that no question is coming from topic since ten years … all of a sudden there was a question in 2019 … guess who solved the question… the ones who didn’t ignore… It hardly takes an hour to learn and practice this topic. Compiler Design :- touch this subject only after you are done with TOC or when TOC is going on….Have a clarity on various types and sub types of parsers. Initially categorize into Top down and Bottom Up parser then categorize into remaining parsers, when a question is asked you write down on scribble pad about what parser you are solving the question for.Syntax Directed Translation.. do all the previous paper question 4 times… the question paper setter really can’t confuse you here… only your computations and interpretation matters.Understand the distinction between L-attributed, S-attributed, Inherited attributes and Synthesized attributes.Don’t read the dragon book line to line… only refer it when are stuck at a particular topic. Operating System one of the toughest subjects of all time .. but with right techniques and tactics can be made into a easiest subject of all time.Read GALVIN Line to line, you are most welcome to read it twice. (only required chapters don’t read the whole book).In CPU Scheduling problems, Most of time, most of the people, make a computational mistake. Your computations are highly important in this particular subject.Short tricky and theory oriented topics like inter process communication and synchronization should never be skipped. Read and practice all the codes required. Properties like Bounded waiting, Progress and Mutual Exclusion are of deadly importance.Concurrency is a topic such that if you dedicate 5hrs to understand and practice it you will surely attempt the question and get it right if the question appears in final exam.Deadlock … just a concentrated 10hrs preparation and practice is enough 2–4 marks are in your account. It is one of the easiest topic in OS.Virtual Memory …. practice harder problem in this topic .. there had been a gradual trend of problems becoming harder and harder year by year… and there is an increasing hardness in this topic… I lost marks in this topic just because I didn’t practice harder problemsPaging… draw diagrams even if it is not required and redundant …. diagrams in paging would give a you a great clarity. Have a good distinction between all types of paging. For example, can you answer as of now difference between Segmented Paging and Paged Segmentation……? can you…?File systems and disk scheduling …. again there is no way question paper setter can trick you … only possibility of going wrong your computations. Databases.. its free given marks, if a question is asked from this subject. One of the biggest technique in this subject is (if you have a little time) solve the question by taking sample database and discarding options.ER Diagrams, don’t you dare solve the problem without putting pen on paper. Never do it with your eyes. Please do write down tables with primary keys underlined on paper then and only then you answer the question.Relational Algebra and tuple calculus…. there is a lot of scope of harder problems being asked from this topic so, practice more. One tactic is (if you are good with SQL) writing equivalent SQL query, sometimes it might work, it might not work. Take sample database and discard options. Don’t search for right answer instead, eliminate wrong options.SQL…. you should have practiced SQL before in some project or other. This is only best way to master it. If you have not done it there are tutorials on internet to practice SQL please do that. Unless you have experience writing SQL queries before , its very hard to solve the problems.Indexing…. your computations are at most importance …. models are being repeated in this topic for years….. only way you loose this question is if you don’t practice or make a computational mistake.Transactions and concurrency control…. Serilizability is the only topic you need to understand good and make sure you identifying the conflicts right. Computer Networks ….. having a little more syllabus that usual subjects… but with repeated revision you can handle this subject..Read forouzan for the topic that are there in the syllabusHave a great understanding of layers, gives you a over all idea about the subjectFlow and Error control.. practice previous problems and make sure you make no mistake in computation. Have in mind what exactly being asked in the questionRouting… if you spend 3hrs on this topic you can sure shot attempt this questionThere are only five application layer protocols given in the syllabus it might take only 2hrs to read about each one of themIf the question paper setter want to ask a logical and computation intensive question from this subject only area he could touch cryptography. There are only a handful of cryptographic algorithms to be learnt and it hardly takes 3hrs to learn and practice each one of them.Learn front and back of TCP, UDP and difference between them.Finally Most important, Most Expected Untapped Area Questions to be asked on toipcs are WIFI and IPV6. These topics have been included in the syllabus 3–4 years back but not a single question is posed on them so, you can expect question from these topics. I have only commented on most important thing with respective every subject, it is to be noted that every topic in the GATE syllabus is important and every topic in GATE syllabus is worthy of question being asked from. I have given you main points but, no topic to be ignored. Study Techniques I have used during preparation Most of my study techniques won’t be any different from any topper but still I would like to list out for your reference Pomodaro is how I used to count study hours daily. A detail explanation is given in my talk about pomodaro and if you google about this study technique you would get a lot of information about this technique written by scholars. I have used a app called Flat Tomato [LINKED_TEXT: ‎Flat Tomato (Time Management)] [URL: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flat-tomato-time-management/id719462746].Everyday post class I would revise what ever taught in the class and I used to redo whatever problems taught in the class.Never skipped a class. Due to dengue fever I had to skip 1 week classes then after in order to recover those classes I have to go to management take a letter and attend those classes in some other batch.Used to write notes in the class. These coaching lectures notes are complied and easier version of Standard Textbook. The soft copies of these notes are available online.Wrote short notes to all the subjects. Instead of making short notes smaller version of normal notes, I tried my level best to make my short notes contain a list of my mistakes.Solved Previous Paper twice, but I would advise you solve it thrice.Practice ACE Academy material, The material is good but there are lot of typos in it , It’s not only case of ACE Academy, Everyone’s material in the market have lot’s and lot’s of mistakes ). Anyway, its up to you to solve the material, there is nothing you would lose by solving the coaching material.Test Series ……… one and only way to evaluate yourself. Believe me, there is no other way.There are many more study techniques I have given in my talk including techniques like pomodaro, it comes around 17:41. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. If you want to know a little more about my study techniques I have written in another answer also I have written the way to use the study resources………[LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to What was your GATE (CSE) preparation story?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-GATE-CSE-preparation-story/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=13ae2926&srid=npmQz] Revision Techniques I have used during preparation.. My Vajrayudham (greatest weapon) was spaced repetition. See, there is no need for this particular techniques to help you in your preparation. I am saying it helped me I might or might not help you. Spaced repetition was only for revision, remembering and retaining purpose, I have done it in two phases. To describe……Learning Spaced repetitionThis used to go with classesEvery day what ever taught, came back home and read those what ever taughtWhatever problems taught in class, I used to do it back on the same day in the evening.Then yesterday topic revision.Then one week back revision.Then one month back revision if necessary (usually I sometimes skipped it because I didn't have time) Revision 1 Time Spaced Repetition (What you actually see in the photos I have attached)Noted down late date on which topic is completed.Form last date, 1 week after I wrote date then, I used to study whole subjectForm last date, 15 days after I wrote date then, again I used to study whole subject.From last date, 1 month after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subjectFrom last date, 2 months after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subject (this only I used to do for hard subjects, you can find the date in compiler design and computer networks) See techniques are to bound to you, you are not bound to techniques, please mould them as per your requirement. The ultimate objective is to learn subject and attain marks. Every time I take a test, If some question has gone wrong, I used to take a look at that topic from short notes this used to be a kind of mini revisionTest are a kind of revision .. during taking of a test.. your mind would be concentrated on retrieving a topic .. this would stress you brain and neurons patterns which have learnt the topic would be reinforced which helps the subject to be retained betterI have given a clear explanation of my revision strategy “Forgetting curve and Spaced Repetition”. In my talk, It comes around 8:32. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. Ways to Tackle Test Series doesn’t matter how good you are, You need to take test series. The one and only way of evaluating yourself is through test series. please do enroll in at least 2 and at most 3 test series. Don't over whelm yourself in enrolling in more than three test series. Make a schedule on how to attempt the test from test series and follow schedule carefully. Don't get demotivated when you secure a very low score in test series and overconfident if you score well. This is the one and only way to evaluate yourself. My testing schedule was different, Instead of telling you what I did for testing I will tell you what I think is best for taking test. I would ask you to take a look at test series, you would find 25m test (30 min), 50m test (1.5hrs) and full length test. Don’t delay giving tests, thinking that after I have completed all my studies I would be giving tests.I would advise anyone to take 25m test as soon as they are done with studying the topic (Let it what ever month it is), as soon as you think you are done with the topic please try to attempt 25M test that would given you an idea about how far you have learnt the topic, you can also analyse how good you have learnt the topic with respective to GATE.I would advise anyone to take 1.5hrs tests during their revision times in the month of October and November. This will give you an idea of what your weak topic and what your strong topic as are, you would encounter models now repeatedly, this would tell you what all models you need to be thorough with.I would advise anyone to take 3hrs tests during the last few months before test, namely December,January and Feb. This would tell you where you are lying and what all you need to improve at and how to tackle the actual exam.See, the 3hrs test thing, various toppers have various perspective on it, some say you need to give full length test every week from the starting of preparation and there are many more views on full length test, I gave you mine. Ways to tackle previous year questions at least 3 times every single question There was a time when solving previous GATE questions was enough to get a reasonably good rank but, times have changed. If you actually see through the past 5 years question papers, I think you will find new questions appearing every year and question being asked from untapped areas. So, there is huge possibility that you might miss these questions if you are only solving PYQ’s. While solving previous year gate questions, please keep these in mind…. If a model is appearing more than once, this is only indication that its a important model. By tinkering the values given in the question make sure that you know this model front and back.There is no certain year from which you need to practice the questions from why would I say this because there has be n number of instances where a model resurfaced after many years. Examples…In Theory of Computation, There was a question on pumping lemma in 1990's then after there was never a question on that topic, again one question appeared in 2019 paper.In computer Organization, There was question about gates to register function while execution of instruction, I still remember that topic in coaching classes was taught but not with much emphasis (because questions stopped coming from that topic since last ten years) but, when I was solving PYQ's I came across this model and even though it was a model of 1989's I still spent an hour reading that topic from carl Hamacher (it was not in detail in the notes). My luck had its way, a question from exactly that topic appeared in GATE 2020. If you have committed mistake while working out a PYQ, make sure you mark it and solve it later point of time, by later point of time I don’t mean in the evening or 2 hrs later, because you will remember the mistake, solve it after a week then if you didn’t get the mistake again you got the concept right, if you committed the same mistake again then you are fooling yourself saying that you understood the topic.If you repeatedly making mistakes in a particular question, take the reference book read that topic and learn the topic again from the scratch. You should have a mistake tolerance for PYQ’s (no of times you can acceptably get wrong answer to a question). How to incorporate standard text books during preparation do not ignore standard textbooks. The list of standard text books are going to be same there are not going to differ from topper to topper. I would like to list of my standard textbook list for only those subject which I read….Computer Organization - Carl Hamacher (only difficult topic)Operating Systems - Galvin (read line to line)Computer Networks - ForouzanAlgorithms - Sahani (only required Algo’s)Theory of computation - Peter Linz (if and only if I didn’t understand the topic)Databases - Korth (only for certain chapters)Compiler Design - Ullman (only for a couple of parsers)See there are lot more standard textbooks in the market if its recommended by a professor they are goodThe way you need to read a standard textbook is different, you can’t just read it like a newspaper, In other answer, I have explained in detail about the way to read a standard Text book [LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to How do I read a standard textbook effectively?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-read-a-standard-textbook-effectively/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=f308fd53&srid=npmQz] Most of the techniques during preparation which are to be stressed a lot are given in my talk … Finally, what ever I wrote above are my personal opinion and my advises, it up to you to follow these or there is no necessity that these will be true for your case too. A little boasting of my preparationThe pens I have kept track of from day 1 to final exam day, My study rack, consisting of Standard text books, notes, Rough notes and other books I read for fun….

Many big banks and loan providers have a strict policy against people with a bad credit record and don’t risk losing their funds by giving them to previous defaulters. Any lender would consider your credit history before giving you a personal loan. This is why a bad credit could make it difficult to secure one. All that said, personal loans for people with bad credit are still possible and available. In fact, many leading startups like MoneyLoji are out there to give a second chance to people with bad credit. These are the steps you can take to get a loan even with a bad credit history- Show Evidence of Income to Support Loan Repayments You may have a low credit rating but a recent hike in salary or having an additional income source can make the lender more favorable to your loan application. Also, if you prove that you have a secure job with a steady income flow, the likelihood of your loan getting approved increases. Do note that you may get a loan with a low credit rating but the interest rates are always higher for such people. Apply for a low amount If you have a low credit rating it is always advisable to take out a loan of a lesser amount and pay your dues on time. Your lender may perceive you as a high-risk candidate if you ask for a high personal loan amount with a low CIBIL score. Applying for a lesser amount and repaying your EMIs on time, will help you improve your credit ratings and help you gain back the lenders’ trust. Apply for a Joint Loan or Get a Guarantor Getting a co-applicant or guarantor with a good credit rating may help you get the personal loan faster. With permission from your co-applicant or guarantor, ensure that the KYC formalities are completed along with the necessary signatures on the relevant forms. When the lender sees a co-applicant or guarantor with a good CIBIL score on your loan application, it definitely helps towards getting a better deal. Keep a Check on Your Credit Report A study by the Federal Trade Commission in 2012 found that approximately 20 percent of customers had an error in their credit reports. A repeat study conducted in 2015 found that customers who reported an unsolved mistake still believed that there was an error in the report. Keep a check on your credit report from time to time for inconsistencies and errors. Credit bureaus are legally bound to offer borrowers one free credit report a year. Online marketplaces have also simplified the process of monitoring credit history. The report could contain errors like incorrect information, a delay in updating the report, or a delay in updating essential details in your report. These errors can adversely affect your credit score. Errors, if any, can be reported and rectified instantly. Therefore, how to check your CIBIL score? Visit MoneyLoji and get a free credit report. Download the app now. Request Your Lender to Consider Your Case with an NA or NH in Your Credit Report An inactive credit period in the last 36 months or absence of a credit period during the same period of time is marked by an NA or NH on your credit report. This translates into you not having a credit score at all in your CIBIL report. Speak to your prospective lender and explain why there is a period of credit inactivity. It is possible that the loan will be approved but with a higher interest rate. All said and done it is clear that getting a loan with a poor credit rating is difficult but not impossible. There are people out there one being MoneyLoji which offers opportunities to people with a low rating. Go ahead and explore your options."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","output":"I usually call my brother in alternate days But today I called him two times in a day.

A: In a sense, they did, but in another sense they didn’t really taste metal. They reported tasting metal. This is common when the brain receives messages that it does not understand. It guesses. These workers were experiencing radiation damage that was outside their experience. They guessed, both consciously and unconsciously, that it was a metallic taste. That was the best description available to them. And it was a good one. It helped to identify the problem. One of the creepiest things I have ever seen was a video of inside the forecastle of a “decomissioned” Russian nuclear ship, in practice abandoned dockside. Spent fuel was stored in this space, but because this fuel was damaged, it had expanded and no longer fitted into the shielded spaces prepared for it. These irradiated fuel elements had been hammered part way into these slots, causing still more damage. Some of them were less than half-way in. As the video progresses, more and more blue dots appear in the image. These are pixel failures of the CCD in the camera, caused by nuclear radiation. Gamma probably. Lots of it. I still wonder whether the cameraman survived. I doubt that the camera did, the CCD replacement is not likely to be an economic repair. I have even more worries about the workmen who had attempted to hammer the fuel into place."},{"instruction":"Are roos scared of saltwater crocodiles in Australia?","output":"The only thing not scared of a salty are idiot tourists, looking for a cheap thrill."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"Because some cats are “free willed”.

She might look like Hero to few people but in a large window, this doesn’t look good. A few months ago, when the Indian government removed Article 370 then, this propaganda video was circulated by Pakistan wherein these kids who had no clue what they were talking, were claiming to take back Kashmir and make the Indian Army sweep the roads, etc. Many Indians criticized this act and told that this is the extent of the radicalization of Pakistani youth. We even commented that “Pakistan will end by its Youth itself” but after seeing today's action by a small child, I feel India too is misleading the future generation. This girl child has no clue about anything that is going on in India or Shaheen Bagh but has been tutored to talk like that. Please, guys, don’t direct your future generation towards the wrong path. India is dependent on its youth and young children and if this future is directed towards the wrong path, India will become similar to Pakistan, which I never want to see. My only request is “Protest is not wrong because you have the right to protest, but thinking that children speaking up like “We’ll give our lives if CAA is not removed is wrong”.

From earning as little as Rs 35 a month to now becoming one of the most generous donors to the farmers of the drought-hit regions, Nana Patekar's story will inspire you beyond words. Here are some of the facts about Bollywood's most generous and kind man who still prefers living a simple life over several luxuries of life that he can easily afford. 1. While he can afford almost every luxury of life, Nana Patekar still chooses to live in a 1 BHK apartment with his mother. 2. He had made a generous donation of 15,000 rupees per family to almost 62 families of the farmers who committed suicide in Marathwada region. He himself visited around 112 farmers’ families in Marathwada. 3. His organization now plans to connect with 700 more in the areas of Nagpur, Latur, Hingoli, Parbani, Nanded, Aurangabad, etc. 4. His foundation has already successfully managed to collect Rs. 22 crores from the people for farmer welfare. The major aim of the foundation now is to fill back the dried lakes and rivers in order to provide safe drinking water to farmers and their families. 5. Nana Patekar, who had undergone strict army training for three years to perfect his role for Prahaar, he was given the honorary rank of Captain in the early ‘90s. Even after the last shot for that movie, he had lent his services to the army, including a stint during the Kargil war. 6. Nana Patekar's foundation received a tremendous response since its first day of inauguration. The foundation collected ₹ 80 lacs on day 1. Today when people question an organization's credibility, this one was a clear win for Nana Patekar and other founders. 7. Actor Nana Patekar personally went to the seats of farmer widows and handed over cheques of Rs. 15,000 in a small hall in Latur, Marathwada. When there was a power failure for 5 minutes, people turned on the torch on their phones so that Nana Patekar could continue to distribute cheques. 8. Explaining his involvement and contribution towards the cause, Nana Patekar told media: \\"Marte damm tak jeene ki vajah mil gai hai mujhe.\\" (I have found a reason to live, till I die.)

If you want to make money, earn fame or want a settled life, I would strongly advise it doesn't Worth!!! Read my whole answer and understand it completely! Sharing my day at Medicine department as an Intern! Tuesday was my emergency (So admission) day. So on monday we assessed conditions of all patients and discharged many patients whom we feel satisfied with recovery. So it took until 9:30 PM on monday. Then I had my dinner and read for some 4 hours and slept at 3AM. My duty starts at 8:30 AM. I have to go to OPD. But I got call from senior at 7:45 and called me earlier to take 5 ECGs in morning before OPD. I just brushed my teeth, changed clothes and ran away. I reached hospital at 7:52. When I went to OPD, I was alone. So suddenly patients rushed in. I got one patient's relative, who gave me case paper of Opthalmology and asked me to write continued treatment. Just like people coming for new prescription for diabetes drugs every month. I asked her for old papers. She had nothing. I asked for used drug packets. She had nothing. I asked her she had to come with the patient and I can examine her and write drugs. Then she got described me that her mother is taking white colour small tablet!!!! What a description! I told her to leave and come only if she had old papers or patient. She started fighting with me. How useless we are and how we are troubling her because she is poor and what not!!! After sometime, pharmacist of our hospital ran into the OPD. In one prescription, one alphabet of drug was not clear due to bad handwriting. Drug was too famous that we use it in every 2nd patient of highBP. He complained my senior and senior scolded me for irresponsible behaviour. I asked for forgiveness and sat down again. At 12PM, consultant came. By chance I got time to drink some water after 3.5 hours… consultant caught me drinking water and no patient. She scolded me for seating free there (I have already checked 100+ patients until she came!). I again asked for forgiveness and listened her lecture. OPD ended by 2:30. With so many fights and back pain due to continues sitting. I came back at 2:50 PM after lunch. In our college, we interns attach all the reports in wards so patient's relatives don't face much troubles. I went to microbiology lab for collection of reports. Sweeper was doing his work there. So he ordered me to wait outside. I told him I am a doctor and today I have emergency. But he was not ready to listen. I ignored him and entered lab. So we had a fight. He told me too many foul words. I ignored and left… I then went to our ward building. My ward is on 4th and 6th floor. So I went to lift. Liftman told me he won't run lift for single doctor and if I had an emergency, I had to climb. I had max 2 minutes to waste there so I better climbed stairs. (Liftman has duty of 8 hours) When I reached ward, again same fight with sweeper. When I ignored and went, I found all cases were taken by nurse. I asked her and she told me to wait. Consultant was visiting in few minutes and it was my duty to attach all reports before. Again a fight. When I was attaching, (we are supposed to carry our own stapler too. Government stapler is for nurses only.) My pins were finished. When I asked nurse scolded me again. Humiliated me against all the patients. One patient came me to told me, “reportvale bhaiya, pin my reports too.” (I was wearing stethoscope too!) Then consultant came. One patient was clearly explained by me 3 times that she had to go to opthalmogy reference. But she didn't go and told consultant she was not explained. Again scolding and sorry cycle. Then I had to go for USG appointment for few patients. I went there and got scolded & humiliated by radiology resident there. Then I took all follow ups in ward and I answered questions of every patient. I don't have great experience as a doctor, but my counseling part is never ever weak! For follow up I had to run for almost 45 minutes and go upstairs and downstairs 10 times. When I was doing ascitic tapping of one patient, patient's relative asked me to hold her abdomin in position so that she can go out and meet another person. She told me that I was very much free and as a doctor it's my duty to help patients!!! Then I went to casualty. In casualty, it's always hectic. We have to run constantly. So many serious patients coming… There was a patient with blood in vomiting. And was too serious having very badly oxygenated and weak pulse. We intubated him and I resuscitation him for 45 minutes with ambu bag and moniterd. During this, one relative was constantly irritating me, as his mother was having abdominal pain. Her condition was very well. Nothing like emergency. Injection for pain was given. But they can't wait for 10 minutes just for injection to work! Then I came back and another relative was there waiting for me. His relative had electrolyte imbalance suspected and we wrote blood reports. Sister hasn't drawn blood. I went to sister room where 5 sisters were talking about some serials. I asked sister to take blood sample and sister became too angry. She told me “It's work of intern. What else do you do… If you can't do this small work, you should not join here.” I was in no mood to fight. I took sample and sent. (Nurse have 8 hours duty only!) But another incident with nurse made my mind out of control. 1 patient needed Blood transfusion. Relatives were too uneducated and very calm. Blood was there for 4 hours without use and it got wasted. Sister didn't even inform any of doctor and told relative doctor will come and do. (It was already verified by my senior - wait was just for starting the infusion). When I asked nurse, she told me, “Infusion is work of doctor. Not ours!”. They kept discussing about their serials. Now I went mad. I have done 12 blood donations till now. For???? This useless cruel nurses???? I kept working till 11PM unitl night without my dinner. So I asked my senior to leave me. He scolded me and told me, if I won't work well, he will not give me Internship Completion Certificate!!! After a long conversation, after all his frustrations came out, he allowed me to go and have dinner and read a few stuff. Life doesn't get any better in residentship. Atleast I get sleep for some 35 hours/week. Residents get around 25–30 hours maximum. Even after completion of all, when you think it's time to settle down, think of money you need for hospital set up. In government, pay scale starts at around 1 lakh/month. After 10 years of medical school, is it enough!? If you put same hard work in something else (16–18 hours a day) you will become CEO of some big company! But if you are interested, if you have big heart, if you want to serve, I must tell you nothing else will matter in life!!! Even after the day I described, I went to sleep with big smile on my face. When next day I called my mother, I told her it was amazing day and shared a few stories of how I helped and saved patients! At the end of the day, happiness, satisfaction and blessings matter only. I thank God every moment for blessings, for giving me opportunities to serve. I couldn't ask for better life. Also read 1st half of this answer!

The problem is the scattering will also involve a momentum change. You may be able to calculate this change by using conservation laws, but you did not know what the initial value was, so you still do not know the momentum, and all you know is the electron is no longer at the position. You might try to cheat by using a photon. If you know the frequency, you know the momentum, and you can know this through the means of generation.

Historically, his village is recorded as a Muslim settlement in 16th century, middle Ottoman period. Of course there were Christian Armenian villages in Nazımiye until 20th century but Ballıca is not one of them. Today, Nazımiye is a Zaza majority district just like Tunceli Merkez, Hozat, Ovacık and Pülümür. Most of the villagers speak Zaza as their primary tongue, and Turkish as L2. I dont know if any of them also speak Kurdish but that is also probable since a lot ethnic Zaza can speak Kurdish since they live near Kurmanji speakers. Zazas are indeed one of the Iranian peoples, yet there are a lot of differences with their neighbouring Kurdish fellows.

It is a data-driven methodology that seeks to eliminate defects, reduce variability, and improve overall process efficiency. Six Sigma uses a structured approach, including the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology, to identify and solve problems within an organization. Green Belts are individuals who have received Six Sigma training and certification, and play a key role in the implementation and execution of Six Sigma projects within their organizations. They are responsible for leading and supporting project teams, using statistical analysis to identify root causes of problems, and making recommendations for process improvements. Green Belts also work closely with Six Sigma Black Belts to implement these improvements. The Six Sigma Green Belt movement has become increasingly popular in recent years, as organizations recognize the value of a structured approach to process improvement. In addition, the certification provides individuals with a valuable skill set that can be applied to a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Overall, the Six Sigma Green Belt movement is a significant part of the larger Six Sigma methodology, and provides organizations with a powerful tool to improve their processes, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction."},{"instruction":"Why do some generators run on natural gas?

How would you convince them? I assume that, unlike most other people who are millionaires+, you are not offering anything of value in return. So how would you go about convincing them? Since postage, at least in the US, is about 0.50, that makes the cost of sending you a dollar bill 50% higher than your request, a statistically considerable increase in cost to your donors. And the time and effort in getting the stamps, envelopes and addressing it to you, though seemingly trivial, is actually sufficient to deter many people from actually sending a letter that they want to send. Would you just beg? “ I want to be a millionaire. Please send me a dollar.” How would you get your message to the great number of people required to make this work. Do you think that everyone who you contact would give you a dollar? Let’s say charitably one in a hundred might respond. That means that you need to get your message to approximately 100 million people. That’s a lot. Even with the internet. Maybe you could lie, tell them your baby child has a horrible disease and you can only get her help if you get money. That might actually work. Of course there’s a substantial risk of going to jail and not ending up with 1 million dollars. Good luck.

On the contrary, there is evidence suggesting that these guidelines are too high. How truthful have our federal health regulatory agencies been? How much influence have big food corporations had on them? Has protein been used as a marketed tool? Is as much recommended really healthy, or unhealthy? Protein is an extremely important and necessary component of every single cell in our bodies. Everybody has different protein requirements, the elderly actually require more. Our bodies use protein for a number of things, from building muscle to repairing tissue, making enzymes, hormones and various other body chemicals. It’s essential, and we need it. But just as with anything else, too much of something can be detrimental, and this seems to be the case with protein. Even the recommended intake of approximately 60 grams per day for the average male, for example, is being called into question by multiple scientists and health experts. Where did the idea that we need so much protein come from? Why do people take protein shakes after a workout? Why are vegans and vegetarians stigmatized with the idea that they do not get enough protein? Where did this type of thinking come from? Protein is a huge money making tool for the food industry. It’s a great marketing tool, especially towards athletes and bodybuilders. The body building/athletic market alone provides a huge incentive to use protein as a marketing tool to drive up sales. But again, where is the science? Why do bodybuilders believe they need enormous amounts of protein to build muscle instead of just using food, and why aren’t we educated about the dangers of over-consuming protein? For those of you who have looked into fasting, you know that multiple studies on fasting have shown extremely beneficial effects, from triggering autophagy and in turn repairing damaged DNA, to killing cancer cells and increasing longevity, to greatly reducing the risk of several different age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. It was through my research into fasting where I came across, multiple times, the importance of a low-protein diet and how vital it is to retain the effects of fasting as well as good overall health. Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span and retards age-related chronic diseases in a variety of species, including rats, mice, fish, flies, worms, and yeast. The mechanism or mechanisms through which this occurs are unclear. The quote above is from a review of literature that’s more than 10 years old. The work presented here is now showing some of these mechanisms that were previously unclear. Fast forward to today and we know a lot more. A study published in the June 5, 2014 issue of Cell Stem Cell by researchers from the University of Southern California showed that cycles of prolonged fasting protect against immune system damage and, moreover, induce immune system regeneration. They concluded that fasting shifts stem cells from a dormant state to a state of self-renewal. It triggers stem cell based regeneration of an organ or system. There is so much literature on fasting and its benefits available for anybody who is curious. It’s easy to dive into the research through a scholarly search on Google, and there are multiple Youtube videos at your disposal of interviews with the scientists who are publishing these papers. So, where does protein come in? Well, lower protein intake as well as fasting are correlated with a major reduction of IGF1 growth hormone. A 2015 study published in Cell Metabolism is one of multiple studies that points out: Mice and humans with Growth Hormone Receptor/IGF-1 deficiencies display major reductions in age-related diseases. Because protein restriction reduces GHR-IGF-1 activity, we examined links between protein intake and mortality. Respondents (n=6,381) aged 50–65 reporting high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in cancer and diabetes mortality during an 18 year follow up period. These associations were either abolished or attenuated if the source of proteins was plant-based. Increases in IGF1, which also goes way down during fasting, is correlated with a number of diseases. Again, protein increases it, but, as the study above states, “these associations were either abolished or attenuated if the source of proteins was plant-based.” A recent study conducted by researchers in California and France found that meat protein is associated with a very sharp increased risk of heart disease, while protein from nuts and seeds is actually beneficial for the human heart. The study is titled “Patterns of plant and animal protein intake are strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality: The Adventist Health Study-2 cohort,” It was a joint project between researchers from Loma Linda University School of Public Health in California and AgroParisTech and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique in Paris, France. It was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The researchers found that people who ate large amounts of meat protein, which is a daily norm for many people, represented a portion of the human population that would experience a 60 percent increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD), while people who consumed large amounts of protein from nuts and seeds actually experienced a 40 percent reduction in CVD. 81,000 participants were analyzed for this study. According to Gary Fraser, MB, ChB, PhD, from Loma Linda University, and François Mariotti, PhD, from AgroParisTech and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, who served as the co-principal investigators: Dietary fats are part of the story in affecting risk of cardiovascular disease, proteins may also have important and largely overlooked independent effects on risk.” The authors emphasized that they, as well as their colleagues, have long suspected that the protein from nuts and seeds in the diet protects against heart and vascular disease, while protein from meat, especially red meats, increases your risk. Fraser said the study leaves other questions open for further investigation, such as the particular amino acids in meat proteins that contribute to CVD. Another is whether proteins from particular sources affect cardiac risk factors such as blood lipids, blood pressure and overweight, which are associated with CVD. Before we go any further, I’d like to emphasize that there is a lot of literature suggesting that plant protein is far more beneficial than animal protein. Who’s had this kind of protein intake before me? Nobody, right? So before these modern generations and all this push on protein nobody had a very high protein diet, not like this. So of course then that is, there is a danger of that we published a few years ago (referenced above), you know, three/four fold increase in cancer risk, seventy five percent increase in overall mortality. The mouse studies [and] the human studies, a great majority of them are negative for for high protein, and then if you look at the reasons for why they’re negative, well one of the things high protein controls is growth hormone and IGF1, and this pathway and axis really controls the growth and proliferation of cells. – Dr. Valter Longo, biogerontologist and cell biologist, one of the leading experts in the world regarding health science, longevity and the biological effects of fasting. Dr. Longo goes on to explain, as he references in his study above, that low protein intake means more longevity and more protection from diseases. In multiple interviews he recommends cutting in half your protein intake if you follow the daily recommended guidelines by health food authorities, I have also heard him say that after a heavy, strong workout, maybe only 30 grams, is required to build muscle. If we look at the proliferation of multiple age-related diseases and cancers, the rates are extremely high and increasing. Could over-consumption of protein, among other reasons, have something to do with it? Russel Henry Chittenden (1856-1943) looked into this issue in depth, before the mass marketing of high protein diets. He published 144 scientific papers as well as a text on protein requirements (Chittenden, 1904) that focused specifically on minimal protein requirements while resting or exercising. Chittenden actually experimented on himself, and when he significantly decreased his protein intake, his health remained excellent without compromising any physical vigor or muscle. In this experiment he had less than 1 g per kg daily. He also did the same in a year long study, but with multiple athletic men in great health. They were also given the same low protein diet, and also suffered no deterioration of health or the ability to perform physical tasks. According to his research, even without a large protein intake, individuals were able to maintain their health and fitness levels. In presenting the results of the experiments, herein described, the writer has refrained from entering into lengthy discussions, preferring to allow the results mainly to speak for themselves. They are certainly sufficiently convincing and need no superabundance of words to give them value; indeed, such merit as the book possesses is to be found in the large number of consecutive results, which admit of no contradiction and need no argument to enhance their value. The results are presented as scientific facts, and the conclusions they justify are self-evident. Dr. Jason Fung is a Toronto based nephrologist. He completed medical school and internal medicine studies at the University of Toronto before finishing his nephrology fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles at the Cedars-Sinai hospital. He joined Scarborough General Hospital in 2001 where he continues to practice and change people’s lives. Below he dispels one of the many myths regarding fasting, that it causes muscle loss, in no uncertain terms: “It seems that there are always concerns about loss of muscle mass during fasting. I never get away from this question. No matter how many times I answer it, somebody always asks, “Doesn’t fasting burn your muscle?” Let me say straight up, NO.” Dr. Fung outlines a critical point. When you fast and deplete all your glycogen, your body is going to start using fat for energy. It starts going to used, damaged cells for energy, and it’s basically going to use all of the bad things first before it gets to the good things, which takes a lot of time. Your body will not burn protein, as protein is not a fuel source. When fasting, Dr. Fung explains how your protein is actually the last thing to go because it’s so important. “Muscle gain/ loss is mostly a function of EXERCISE. You can’t eat your way to more muscle. Supplement companies, of course, try to convince you otherwise. Eat creatine (or protein shakes, or eye of newt) and you will build muscle. That’s stupid. There’s one good way to build muscle – exercise. So if you are worried about muscle loss – exercise. It ain’t rocket science. Just don’t confuse the two issues of diet and exercise. Don’t worry about what your diet (or lack of diet – fasting) is doing to your muscle. Exercise builds muscle. OK? Clear?” Dr. Fung makes it clear that fasting does not burn your muscle, unless you take it to a very extreme level, and that’s something neither he nor we are recommending here. There is also clinical evidence showing that fasting does not cause muscle loss. For example, a 2010 study of alternate daily fasting showed that patients were able to lose a lot of fat mass with no change in lean mass. Several metabolic benefits were also observed. A study from 2016 compared intermittent fasting with daily calorie restriction. The intermittent fasting group lost only 1.2 kg of lean mass compared to 1.6 kg in the calorie restriction group. Comparing the percentage increases in lean mass, the fasting group increased by 2.2% compared to 0.5% in the calorie restriction group, showing that fasting may be up to 4 times better at preserving lean mass according to this measure. Importantly, the fasting group lost more than double the amount of the more dangerous visceral fat. When you fast, and do it right, it’s probably the most effective way to get rid of visceral fat. Despite the concerns that fasting may cause loss of muscle, the long human experience as well as human clinical trials show the exact opposite. Intermittent fasting seems to preserve lean tissue better than convention weight loss methods. – Dr. Jason Fung That being said, Fung also mentions body type. Exactly how much protein is needed during fasting really depends upon the underlying condition. If you are obese, then fasting is very beneficial and you will burn much more fat than protein. If you are quite lean, then fasting may not be so beneficial, as you will burn more protein. This seems rather obvious, but our body is really quite a bit smarter than we give it credit for. It can handle itself during feeding, and during fasting. How exactly the body is able to make this adjustment is currently unknown. Researchers from McMaster University also published a study showing that caloric restriction combined with exercise did not deplete muscle, and those who consumed enough protein actually saw gains. The authors emphasized how exercise, particularly lifting weights, provides a signal for muscle to be retained even when you’re in a big calorie deficit. The group that did not have a lot of protein during calorie restriction didn’t see any muscle gains, but experienced no muscle loss. Consuming protein and eating after a workout when you’ve fasted beforehand is important for muscle growth. But some people would be fine continuing their fast, keeping protein intake down, thus lowering their IGF-1 growth hormone levels (which also happens when you fast). When this happens, your body is in autophagy, damaged cells are repairing themselves, and your body is eating what it wants to get rid of. It’s a very healthy process that you can learn more about here. I could literally go on and on, but the point is that you’re not going to lose muscle if you fast. Over-protein consumption seems to have been the result of food industry marketing. Why has nobody ever asked for any type of scientific proof or experiments when it coms to how much protein the human body requires? Why have we simply believed that a diet high in protein is an absolute necessity, simply based on the fact that we know protein from food is necessary? Why didn’t we ask for proof until now?"},{"instruction":"US wars after 9/11, who is on the losing end, the West or the Muslim terrorists?","output":"The US loses military peons.

Being Turkic is not racial. Being Mongoloid is racial, but the question asks for a pure ethnicity, which does not exist, not to mention that searching for racial purity in people is a racist act, but I will try to give an answer to this question. First of all, even the Turks from Central Asia, who are pointed at as the purest Turks are not pure. Central Asia was first filled with extinct Iranian ethnicities. So, the Turkic people in Central Asia mixed with them. Differently, the Turkic people that live in Central Asia mixed with Mongols and other non-Turkic East Asian ethnicities. So, there are actually no pure Turks. When we look at the big picture, there is no pure ethnicity. There can be ethnicities that are purely from a race, which means being 100 percent of a certain genetic ancestry. If we recall that first Turks were racially fully Mongoloid, and as people from the Mongoloid race mostly inhabit Eastern Asia, we can assume that the Turkic people that live in the easternmost point are “purer,” relative to other Turkic ethnicities. Sakha Republic is an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation that has a significant Turkic population and is the easternmost point on earth that the Turkic people traditionally inhabit, so that can be the answer. In addition, Kazakhstan can also be an answer, if we only consider independent countries (, though, Kazakhs are mostly considered to be racially Turanid, a Caucasian subrace that is a bridge between the Caucasian and the Mongoloid races). As I said, these countries are not the ones with “the purest Turks” but with the Turkic people that have the most percentage of East Asian/Mongoloid ancestry, which does not have to solely come from the Turkic people at all."},{"instruction":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","output":"I see a lot of people here talking about destroying your drive entirely. Smashing it with a hammer, burning it, corrosion, etc. Ideally, yes, you want to destroy the physical drive to make 100% sure that the data is gone for good, but that’s not the only way. So to answer your question, I’m going to first answer the question “How do they recover deleted files in the first place?” It’s quite simple. When you delete a file from your Windows/Mac/Linux/Etc PC it doesn’t actually delete it. It simply marks that data as “deleted” or “free space” so when new applications and files are added, it can overwrite that data. This is good for performance. HDD’s in particular store information as 1’s and 0’s (Binary data), but the physical part is essentially small metal bits that are charged with either a positive or negative charge (Positive = 1, Negative = 0). So if your data looks like this:100101101001110And you replace it with this:000000000000000It’s as good as gone. Not even the best recovery experts in the world could recover this data. That’s where Data distruction software comes in handy. There are several different applications that can do this, but the only one I’m somewhat familiar with is an application called Eraser. You can find it here: [LINKED_TEXT: Secure Erase Files from Hard DrivesIt works with Windows XP (with Service Pack 3), Windows Server 2003 (with Service Pack 2), Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7,8,10 and Windows Server 2012.Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000 can still be used with version 5.7!.It works with any drive that works with Windows.Secure drive erasure methods are supported out of the box.Erases files, folders and their previously deleted counterparts.Works with an extremely customisable Scheduler.https://eraser.heidi.ie] [URL: https://eraser.heidi.ie/]The upshot of this is that you don’t need to go out and buy a new drive. Just stick it into a machine, wipe the drive, and reuse like you used to, at no extra cost. Eraser even has an option of rewriting random data over and over several times to guarantee the loss of all data on the drive, and if someone were to try to recover anything from the drive, they’d just see complete gibberish.

I personally do not believe that any list can be exhaustive enough to figure out all scenarios that can help you prevent accidents. Driving a car is as risky as walking down the road. We cannot eliminate all the risks but only figure out ways to mitigate them. I would try to cover all the aspects that lead to road accidents in one way or another: Self Awareness - Under-age driving, drinking and driving, rash and careless driving, honking and contributing to road rage are huge factors I would say which we as individuals need to be aware that we are driving responsibly.Public decency - Sometimes, we take shortcuts, drive the wrong way and not adhere to the lights. We are not considerate of other’s requirement and add to chaos only in a bid to be the first in the queue of cars.Not opting for safety - While buying a car, we are not bothered about safety and rather go for a model that is cheaper. We need to think if INR 50,000 is more important or your life. Some car manufacturers have made ABS and airbags standard, but we should not wait for them. If more people opt for safer variants, higher sales will force car manufacturers to phase out the ones without safety features.Don't blame others - While driving we need to understand our alertness is of paramount importance. Other drivers can lose their attention span but you can avert the accident if you are alert. Understanding situations and having a good hold over the controls will be a make or break situation at times.Of course, destiny has its own way of shaping your life.

An official said that the CR had written a letter requesting UNESCO to consider Matheran Light Railway for the prize. The winner is likely to get 30,000, a certificate and recognition. “They had sought for more details, which are being sent. We are operating the toy train on the Aman Lodge-Matheran stretch, while the remaining portion is undergoing necessary improvement works,” the official said. Sources in the CR said the presentation will include photos of cultural activities, local traditions, wildlife and rare species of Matheran, details of flora and fauna at the hill station, along with how the rail impacts the daily life, business and livelihood of the locals. This mini toy train is the centre of attraction for tourists visiting Matheran. The CR had equipped the train with a Vistadom coach to attract tourists. This iconic toy train route has connected Mumbai to its closest hill station, Matheran, since 1907. It is operational on the Aman Lodge-Matheran stretch out of the entire Neral-Matheran route from 2019. Last year’s torrential rains had led to washing away of train tracks at 21 locations on this entire route. The CR had managed to rectify technical failures and restart the services.

Your daughter-in-law is trying to be a good mother and protect her children. Unfortunately she’s making decisions based on misinformation and does not realize that not vaccinating her children puts them and other children at risk of getting incurable diseases that can only be prevented by vaccines. She has not been told the potentially fatal side effects of those diseases. They are far scarier than autism and, unlike the autism claim, none of these side effects are disputed by anyone. Everyone agrees they are real concerns. Your daughter-in-law began by clicking on one or two anti-vax stories and is now being heavily influenced by social media that almost never offers her pro-vax links. Ask her to watch “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix to help her understand what is happening. The constant bombardment of anti-vax misinformation and scare tactics has scared the hell out her. She is almost never offered links that will balance things out for her. Understand that both of you want what is best for the child. Ask her to explain her fears and listen to her carefully. Tell her that you understand why she is so scared to vaccinate her child and that you believe she is trying to do the right thing. Tell her you are also scared for the child’s well-being and worry they could suffer brain damage, deafness and even death if not vaccinated against certain diseases. Tell her you believe she needs to know both sides before she can make an informed decision. Tell her that you think she should be informed about the diseases vaccines prevent and what can happen to children who catch those diseases. Tell her NOBODY disputes that these diseases can have these outcomes. Tell her that most of the scientific community disputes that vaccines cause autism or are otherwise dangerous.

Right after she changed her mind, all seven of her kids caught whooping cough.https://globalnews.ca/news/4741087/vaccine-hestitant-mom-canada/] [URL: https://globalnews.ca/news/4741087/vaccine-hestitant-mom-canada/] [LINKED_TEXT: What's important to knowVaccine-preventable diseases have not gone away. Some parents choose not to immunize their children because they believe vaccine-preventable diseases are no longer around. However, some of these diseases, such as pertussis (whooping cough) and mumps, still occur in small numbers in Canada. Others, such as measles and polio, are common in other countries and are only a plane ride away. Without protection from vaccines, these diseases would spread quickly here, and outbreaks could occur. You can't always avoid vaccine-preventable diseases. Any child can be exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases. Even if you avoid contact with people who are ill, you may not be able to prevent your child from coming in contact with a vaccine-preventable disease. Some examples: An unimmunized child can get measles by simply breathing the air in a room where someone with measles has been. Tetanus bacteria are found in dirt, dust, and soil. Any unimmunized child is at risk for tetanus. People can have a vaccine-preventable disease and have no symptoms but still infect others. Community immunity does not guarantee protection for an unimmunized child. Some parents who decide not to immunize may believe that community immunity (herd immunity) will protect their child. However, community immunity does not guarantee protection for an unimmunized child. Your child will not be protected through community immunity if you live in an area with low immunization rates. Further, community immunity does not protect against all vaccine-preventable diseases (for example, tetanus). Unimmunized children are more likely to get a vaccine-preventable disease than immunized children. Unimmunized children have a much greater chance of getting a vaccine-preventable disease than children who have been immunized. This is the case even in countries with high immunization rates. An example: I n 2014, the Fraser Valley experienced the largest measles outbreak in BC in almost 30 years. It was thought to be caused by a traveller from the Netherlands, where a measles outbreak was occurring. Low immunization rates in one community allowed measles to spread quickly, resulting in over 400 cases. Not immunizing your child can put your family and others at risk. When you choose not to immunize your child, you put not only your child at risk but also your family and others, including: Newborn babies who are too young to get immunized. People with weakened immune systems (for example, those receiving treatment for cancer). People with chronic health conditions. Communities depend on high immunization rates to keep vaccine-preventable diseases from spreading. The more people who are immunized, the lower the risk for everyone. If you refuse vaccines for your child, you may be contacted and offered the vaccines again. If you refuse vaccines for your child, you may be contacted and offered the vaccines again. Vaccine refusal will be noted in your child's chart.

As a platform, the online bookstore mobile application provides users a wide range of books where they can browse books by authors, genre, etc. The development cost of such an application depends on multiple factors. These factors include functionalities that can be integrated with the mobile application, team of experts, use of technology, etc. Basically, there are two types of bookstore applications. These are: 1. For book store by publishing house 2. Individual bookstores. Online bookstore mobile app mainly has three panels to control the app that are, publisher panel, customer panel, and admin panel. This app required a combination of the development team that will help you to develop a high featured application. Bookstore mobile applications are backed by some SEO tools and email marketing functionalities that help you promote your bookstore app and to maximize your app reach to a large number of audiences. The final cost depends on various things such as operating system, location, team size, features, duration, and other specific functionalities required for an advanced level application. In general, the cost of the online bookstore app amounted to 40000 for the single platform app and 60000 for the cross-platform. The cost of development also depends on companies’ location.

The goal of on-page SEO is to make your web pages more relevant to search engines and users by optimizing various elements directly within the web page's content and HTML code. This helps search engines understand the content of your page and rank it higher for relevant search queries. If you want to rank your website on Google visit [LINKED_TEXT: Here] [URL: https://eassytoshop.blogspot.com/2023/08/on-page-seo-optimization.html] Key components of on-page SEO include: 1. Keyword Optimization: This involves researching and selecting relevant keywords that users might use to find your content. These keywords are strategically placed in the page's content, headings, meta tags, and other elements. 2. Content Quality: High-quality, valuable, and relevant content is crucial for on-page SEO. Content should address the needs and interests of your target audience and provide comprehensive information on the topic. 3. Meta Tags: Meta titles and meta descriptions are HTML elements that provide a brief summary of the web page's content to search engines and users. These should include targeted keywords and accurately describe the page's content. 4. Headings and Subheadings: Proper use of headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) helps structure your content and signal its hierarchy to search engines. Keywords can also be included in headings to indicate the topic's importance. 5. URL Structure: Creating descriptive, user-friendly URLs that include relevant keywords can improve the chances of your page being discovered by search engines. 6. Image Optimization: Images should have descriptive filenames and alt text that include keywords to make them accessible to search engines and improve overall page relevancy. 7. Internal Linking: Linking to other relevant pages within your website helps users navigate your content and distributes page authority throughout your site. 8. User Experience (UX): A well-designed and easy-to-navigate webpage enhances user experience, which indirectly influences SEO. Fast loading times, mobile responsiveness, and clear navigation contribute to a positive user experience. 9. Page Loading Speed: Search engines take into account how quickly a page loads. Optimizing images, minimizing code, and leveraging browser caching are some ways to improve page speed. 10. Mobile-Friendliness: With the increase in mobile searches, having a mobile-responsive website is crucial for both user experience and SEO. 11. Structured Data: Markup languages like Schema can be used to provide additional context to search engines about the content on your page, which can enhance the way your page is displayed in search results. 12. Social Sharing: Integrating social sharing buttons can encourage users to share your content, potentially increasing its visibility and driving more traffic. Remember that while on-page SEO is essential, it's just one aspect of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Off-page factors like backlinks and social signals also play a role in search engine rankings. Effective on-page SEO requires a balance between optimizing for search engines and creating valuable content for users."},{"instruction":"Can I see a picture of your dog?","output":"Dogs have given us their absolute all.

Firstly I would try and find a compromise. I only had one Maid of Honour at my small wedding and although my wedding colours were mainly yellow and I’d loved to have her in a yellow dress, she told me from the start that yellow makes her look ill so we agreed that she could wear grey and carry yellow flowers. The men were in grey suits with yellow buttonholes and yellow ties so we just added a few grey elements to the colour scheme. If she’s a good friend you don’t want to lose then if the dress is too short, have her in a longer one etc. If she doesn’t want to show her arms, provide her with a shawl, bolero or wrap or get a seamstress to make an addition. Having said that, it is your day so make sure your friend is willing to compromise too because it’s not her wedding day and she doesn’t get to not wear the dress just because it’s not exactly to her taste and if that is the case then perhaps it may be better if she declines to be a bridesmaid. When it’s her wedding day, she can make you wear something you don’t particularly like. So ask her what she hates about the dress most and agree to try and reach a compromise but make it clear that it might not be possible to put her in a completely different dress, especially if all the other bridesmaids are wearing the same, but that you won’t harbour any ill feelings if she chooses to drop out"},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"I explain here not about any horrible thing I saw in a mental hospital but how a terrible diagnosis changed me and my life.

It's always better to run if you sense a threat and never face one, then to ignore that sense, and have to fight for your life. Study hard in school and complete all schooling consecutively. Trying to go back to school after working is very hard because you forget what you don't use.

They implemented a unique approach to fostering employee loyalty and retention while boosting sales. This retailer recognized that employee turnover in the retail industry is a significant challenge due to the demanding nature of the work and the typically transient nature of the workforce. To address this, they introduced a comprehensive employee development and recognition program that had a remarkable impact on both the employees' job satisfaction and the company's bottom line. First, the retailer invested heavily in training and skill development for their employees. They provided regular workshops on customer service, fashion trends, and personal styling techniques. This not only improved employees' job skills but also enhanced their confidence and engagement with customers. Secondly, they introduced a tiered rewards system that was directly linked to sales performance and customer satisfaction scores. However, what set this system apart was its emphasis on teamwork. Rather than focusing solely on individual sales numbers, the rewards were structured to encourage collaboration among employees. When a team collectively achieved their sales targets and received positive feedback from customers, everyone on the team would be eligible for rewards, creating a strong sense of camaraderie. Furthermore, the retailer fostered a culture of inclusivity and creativity. They encouraged employees to provide input on visual merchandising and store layout, allowing them to feel invested in the store's success. Employee feedback was taken seriously, and many of their ideas were implemented, which resulted in a more inviting shopping environment and a sense of ownership among the staff. In this shrewd maneuver, the retailer effectively tackled employee retention challenges by combining skill development, recognition, teamwork, and a sense of ownership. This not only reduced turnover rates but also led to increased customer satisfaction and sales growth. The employees felt valued, engaged, and motivated to contribute to the company's success, making it a prime example of strategic thinking in the context of [LINKED_TEXT: employee retention in retail] [URL: https://easysim.cloud/22-06-2023-the-state-of-employees-in-the-retail-industry/]."},{"instruction":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","output":"With stir fry the heat is higher and the action is faster.

I started my software engineering journey with my current company back in 2018 June for 6LPA fixed. Though all my internships were from Android, joining to the company I was told that i have to work on iOS. Having no knowledge of iOS app development back then, I started learning by myself and started working on the production app after three months. By year end I was good at it and I made the app much more stable. Being happy with my performance i got a hike and it reached to 8LPA. Mean time I was working on other utility projects too for web development as I had experience for MEAN stack. After 3 years I was given a hike of mere 50 thousand which made my CTC 8.5LPA. I was disappointed with that and decided to leave. Told our CTO about my plan of leaving which eventually reached CEO. Then he had a discussion about it and asked about my expected salary. I told I am expecting 12LPA. He said we will give 11 for now and will make it 12 after 6months. I accepted it and later he stayed on his words and it was made to 12. Now this year 2022 January, he called me in and told that our full time web developer is leaving the company and now I have to work on the web projects till we find a experience full time web developer guy. He asked about my expectations for this. I told I am not sure. I did not want to ask for less and wanted to see how far he can go. He said I will give the leaving web developer guy's CTC to you and will revise again after 6 months. Leaving web developer guy was making 8LPA. So from April 2022 my package will be 20LPA, all fixed. I work in a startup here in Bangalore which deals with home automations. I am the only iOS developer here, so company depends very heavily on me for this regard. I like learning new technologies and working on a same app for years was becoming boring for me and having the opportunity of working on something new which actually matters for the company will be interesting tough for me. Whatever I said is based on my experience with Startup. If you joined some MNC, thing wont be same for that case. In startups people value your contribution and you are owner of the product itself. When I will be leaving this company I will be able to say that I made this app from scratch pixel by pixel. That will be something worth of being pride in I guess. So be good at what you do. Always try to be updated with new technologies. Don't just be comfortable with only one thing. I do multiple things in my day to day job. I even do UI designing whenever it is needed. As the tool I am currently working on is directly used by the CEO, i will try my best to make it perfect so that after 6months I can get at least 5LPA hike which will make my CTC 25LPA :P . I know i am being greedy here, but come on, who is not in this world. ;) Hope this helps, thanks for reading.

For more information go through [LINKED_TEXT: this article] [URL: https://blog.superprofs.com/gate/mistakes-to-avoid-in-gate-exam/?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=answer] Here is a list of mistakes that you need to avoid while attempting the GATE exam – · Not understanding the GATE syllabus - Like any other examination, understanding the GATE syllabus thoroughly before starting with the preparation is a very important step for a GATE aspirant. A common mistake to avoid in GATE is starting the preparation without much knowledge of the total syllabus and thus ending up wasting time and energy on unnecessary topics, leaving aside the important ones. A GATE tip would be to ensure aspirants thoroughly go through the syllabus first. · Procrastination - Procrastination or delaying studies cost a lot in a competition and is definitely a mistake to avoid in the GATE exam. GATE aspirants should make a timetable with daily/weekly/monthly targets and should try to stick to the same. Delaying the study creates a pile of topics at the end to finish, which hinders success. · Memorizing instead of understanding the concept - The other most common mistake to avoid in the GATE exam is to not understand the concept of a topic. Simply memorizing does not help in the long run and the GATE aspirant will end up forgetting the crux of the topic in the examination and end up attempting the questions wrongly. A useful GATE tip would be to have formulae ready on your fingertips, before solving the numerical. · Following others while preparing - Every GATE aspirant differs in their way of preparing for the GATE exam. Following others and copying their notes and techniques is a mistake to avoid in GATE It confuses and demoralizes the GATE aspirants and they end up wasting a lot of their time in collecting notes while losing quality study time. · Undisciplined preparation - Undisciplined preparation is again a very common mistake GATE aspirants No sequence and system followed while studying makes the aspirant lose focus when the crucial last month of preparation comes. A GATE tip would be that from the very beginning, a systematic order should be followed for disciplined preparation. · Overdoing the preparation - Yes! You read it right. Overdoing the study also is a mistake to avoid in GATE. Some GATE aspirants start their preparation much ahead of time and are already too exhausted and bored of reading the same thing again around exam time. Boredom causes a lot of difference in results. A balanced study is required for reaching the goal. · Comparing with others - No two people are the same and GATE aspirants should avoid comparing themselves over mock test results. Nobody has got an equal hold on the topics. Doing so results in depression and hinders the path of success eventually and is thus a mistake to avoid in GATE. · Lack of confidence and concentration - GATE is an examination that requires a lot of confidence and concentration. Many times GATE aspirants go through the pressure of examination and thus get low on confidence. A GATE tip would be to keep your cool and follow basic yoga and exercises to keep the morale high. High confidence and firm concentration help in much better results. We hope that the above-given mistakes will come in benefit to you and will definitely help you qualify the exam with high marks.

I don't want it outlawed, but again I don't want ANY public money supporting it (not even indirectly, which is what we have today.)"},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"After experiencing and observing different things, my opinion about the first date is different. The first date should not be about a fancy restaurant and expensive dishes that may taste awful, but due to peer pressure, one feels compelled to try them. Instead, the first date should focus on proper communication and thoughtful discussion. Just sit at a simple tea stall (tapri) and get lost in conversations, to the extent that you forget about other people coming there. This is a perfect first date idea for me. And when it comes to the billing part, I have a personal preference. I love being around a girl who has a strong mindset and can pay her part without saying anything. I prefer going out with someone who can easily pay her part even without me having to say anything about it, and my observing skills help me identify such individuals. When I went on the date, we both decided to split the expenses equally, including the cost of the auto or cab, and we did that. Most of the time, we focused on having meaningful conversations rather than spending on fancy dishes. We even stood on the street and had momos. I understand that many men consider themselves more masculine if they pay the entire bill because they asked for the date. However, I believe that it's not fair for me to be the sole entertainer and pay for everything, while the girl is only there for the food. Personally, I think if I allow her or ask her to pay her bill, it gives her a sense of responsibility and indirectly acknowledges her presence on the date. It allows her thoughts and personality to flourish in front of me because she's also contributing. I strongly believe that when someone pays the entire bill, it can create an inequality in body language too. So, my personal tip before going on a first date is to decide if you want to present yourself as materialistic or perfect based on your possessions like salary, phone, shoes, etc. Always remember that fake people attract fake people. It's better to be genuine and focus on meaningful connections. If you present yourself materialistically on a date, and the opposite person is happy with it, they are not impressed by you, but by your material possessions, and such relationships tend to be short-term. Masculinity doesn't mean paying the entire bill but it means giving the other person confidence to express their thoughts comfortably because they also contributed to the date. When someone hasn't paid, they might sound a bit under-confident when it comes to sharing their thoughts, or they may think their beauty is enough for the date. If you're looking for a long-term relationship, make the other person realize that both of you need to take equal accountability and responsibility. Lastly, choose a simple location and have meaningful conversations about life. A real girl will find these qualities very attractive, not your material possessions, and she will be attracted to your overall personality. She will happily share everything equally. In summary, impressing someone through material possessions may not lead to a genuine connection. Instead, focus on building trust, communication, and shared responsibility to foster a strong and long-lasting relationship.

A question that everyone loves to ask Salman Khan (and he hates) is about his marriage! While Salman Khan has a lot in his basket of controversies including the number of girlfriends he has had. Sangeeta Bijlani Sangeeta Bijlani is Salman Khan's first girlfriend and his first love. The actor met Sangeeta at the beginning of his career when she had just won the crown of Miss India. According to the rumours, the duo was very serious and they even moved in together. It is also said that their wedding preparations were stalled halfway in 1994. Somy Ali Pakistani actress Somy Ali was just 19 years old when she made her Bollywood debut. Salman Khan has dated Somy Ali for six years and they separated in 1999 due to Salman Khan's aggressive behaviour. However, they are good friends to date. Aishwarya Rai This was one of the most talked-about controversies in Bollywood. Aishwarya and Salman Khan's relationship sparked on the sets of 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam'. Both seemed very serious about their relationship. However, it was Salman Khan's abusing behaviour that led to the end of this relationship in 2002. Eventually, this came out to be the worst breakup of Bollywood. Sneha Ullal After facing the ugliest breakup with Aishwarya Rai, Salman Khan could not get over Aishwarya and ended up dating her look-alike Sneha Ullal. Sneha debuted with Salman in a film titled 'Lucky'. Eventually, things didn't go well and the two also broke up. Katrina Kaif In the long list of Salman Khan's relationships, this one is the most famous. Salman Khan is also known as a career-maker for Katrina Kaif. The duo dated for a couple of years but eventually broke up. However, according to reports, Katrina and Salman sought whatever that had happened and came back together on screen once again. Zareen Khan After a breakup with Katrina Kaif, Salman discovered Zarine Khan who apparently looks a lot like Katrina Kaif. I mean what is with Salman dating his ex-girlfriend's look-alikes? The two worked together for a song and have starred in a couple of movies too. But unfortunately this became one of Salman's most unsuccessful relationships and this relationship as well went down the drain. Claudia Ciesla Salman was smitten with German model Claudia and was even seen hanging out with her at various events and public appearances. There was quite a stir and things took a new turn when Salman apparently made a statement that Claudia was a nice girl and he was very happy to introduce her to his family. But later, things did not move any further and this relationship also turned futile. Mahek Chahel Salman Khan himself confirmed that he biased towards Mahek Chahel in the reality show Bigg Boss. If rumours are to be believed, then Salman Khan and Mahek Chahel have been in a relationship for once. Daisy Shan Choreographer and dancer, Daisy Shah is also a part of Salman Khan's list of girlfriends. The actress was introduced by Salman Khan in the film 'Jai Ho'. This sparked talks of romantic involvement between the two. Lulia Vantur Salman Khan's recent girlfriend is Romanian model Lulia Vantur. According to the reports, Salman Khan will soon be hearing the wedding bells of his own marriage."},{"instruction":"Which is the best theme restaurant in Bangalore?","output":"There is a primal need for humans to want change.

Yet I go home, and I think to myself every single day: what did I LEARN? I find myself unable to answer. I will take a test, score 100, and not know the answer to the most basic questions about the concepts; I only knew the study guide. I could never figure out why, that was, until my English teacher incorrectly graded one of my quizzes, on an ambiguous question given by a machine generation(select sentence that uses a word correctly). I knew I was right, and my evidence was that the same machine had given me a clear-cut definition of the word, even though the real world application of the word was correctly used in another sentence. He was not the type to give away free points however, and for no less than 10 minutes we argued and argued. Eventually he stopped and said, “I will give you the points, as long as you understand that this use(points at question) of the word is correct.” And it hit me in that moment. How pointless it all had been. I wasn’t trying to understand the material; I was trying to get the points. And not only that. What is a ‘point’? What does that mean? Right now, come up with what a point is, and what it means. If you could think of nothing but the inescapable, unavoidable truth of a means of getting a good grade, you understand what I’m saying. I’ll do you one better; what is a grade? Does it really show your proficiency? After all, it is just a numerical value of how good you are at point chasing, not your knowledge and skill. I’ve worked on projects before and tried to be creative, try not to point-chase, and my grade gets burned EVERY SINGLE TIME. Another thing I didn’t understand; I had always had the best grades, yet I have never thought as myself as particularly more intelligent than your average person. This bugged me for a while, call it Dunning-Kruger Effect if you want to. Then, one day, right before a vocabulary quiz in Spanish, I learned there was an entire back to a vocabulary sheet we needed to know. About 30 words, and I had 2 minutes to study before class started. 100% was my score. I’m “smart” because I have a picture-perfect short term memory. Not because I’m smart. Your grade is your ability to memorize and regurgitate information, with a little bit of work ethic sprinkled in. I can tell you this is true even for me, as a top-of-the-top student. What was I getting that select a sentence question right for? What did the 96% turning into 100 mean? It meant absolutely nothing. It was my score, turned into my grade, which turned into my final grade, which turned into my GPA, which I will show colleges on a resume, who really think it means I’m smart. Then I take 4 more years of classes. And I do it all again. On and on and on. When does it end? When does being nothing but a memorization bot catch up with you? I suppose it’s right after everyone stops helping you, and you’re on your own."},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"A2A. That exclamation point means that your battery is completely exhausted. You don’t have enough charge to even turn your Kindle on. Even after you plug it in, it may take a few minutes to store enough charge to start. My phone is like that, too. If the charge goes down to zero, I have to have it on the charger for at least 3–4 minutes before I can turn it on again. If the battery won’t charge, then you’ll have to replace it. The batteries cost around thirty bucks. If THAT doesn’t work, then you’ll have to send it in to Amazon for service. My old Kindle Keyboard got to where it wouldn’t start; rather than wait all the time it would take for shipping to Amazon, them diagnosing and perhaps repairing it, the charges for that, and them shipping it back, I bought a Paperwhite.

However in Natyashastra the elements have not been explicitly described. They are similar for all classical dance forms in India. Elements of Indian classical dance as per ‘Abhinaya Darpana Prakasha’ are divided into three distinct categories, namely, ‘Natya’, ‘Nritya’ and ‘Nritta’. ‘Natya’ is related to drama and ‘Nritya’ to the gesture accompanied by a musical composition. ‘Nritta’ refers to pure dancing where the body movements do not express any meaning. All these aspects use movements of the limbs and poses of the human body as their medium. The universal root of all Indian classical dance forms can be related to ‘Bharata’s Natyashastra’. According to the ‘Natyashastra’, Lord Brahma is the originator of the Universe and he has created the drama. The Indian classical dance forms are directed by the essential elements of an act with ‘abhinaya’ and ‘rasa’.

Now, to convince people that gun control is a good thing, you'd have to show how there is absolutely no more crime in the world, and that their government could be trusted and wasn't tyrannical.

I think that there are some questions about Emirates’ costs and pricing that other airlines, and especially the US legacy carriers, are unhappy about. One is how have they been able to afford to buy the fleet they have? Are the Dubai royal family subsidising them? Well, maybe - we don’t really know - but I also think that they were able to get some really good deals from the manufacturers. They have brought more than 100 A380s, and I can’t imagine they paid the aviation equivalent of list price for them; and they also have a pretty big set of 777s. So they’ve struck good deals. Next, the fact that ultimately they are owned by the al Maktoum family means that perhaps banks and finance houses see Emirates as being a slightly better risk than other airlines, and that might translate into better financing arrangements for all those aircraft. And finally, we don’t actually know what they are being charged for the use of Terminal 3 at Dubai International airport. Again, this is owned by the rulers of Dubai, its finances (like Emirates’) are rather opaque, and it is possible that Emirates is not being charged a fully commercial price for the extraordinary facilities they have at DXB. All of that sounds like criticism, and I don’t mean it to - it’s a large organisation maximising its advantages. There are other aspects to their pricing. I’ve flown a dozen flights on Emirates, all economy, from Manchester in the UK to Singapore and Bangkok with a transfer at Dubai. (All Emirates flights go to, or start from, Dubai). But from Manchester? In northern England? Well, Emirates have had a service from/to Manchester for about 30 years. Originally it was a connecting flight to Frankfurt, but for about 20 years it’s been a direct flight to Dubai. And they have marketed it very well. In 2018 the service between Manchester and Dubai was the second-most popular service at Manchester airport, with just over a million passengers. They fly three times a day, all of the flights are on A380s, and they fill them - they’re rammed. Service is good - food (tasty and served with metal cutlery) and alcohol are free - the in-flight entertainment system is regarded as the best in the world, and baggage limits are generous, especially for hold baggage. Why can a middle-eastern airline generate a huge traffic out of nothing, whereas the the US airlines flying out of Manchester to the US are not doing anything like as well? United for example do an almost -daily service to Newark Liberty International, but just one flight a day and on older aircraft - 767s these days, but it used to be on 757s. And that United flight to Newark costs more than an Emirates flight into Asia (Singapore, for example, with a connection at Dubai) let alone a flight just to Dubai. So I think Emirates might just deserve their success."},{"instruction":"What is the diference between ethical hacking and cyber forensics?","output":"Ethical hacking and cyber forensics are both integral components of the cybersecurity landscape, but they serve distinct purposes within the realm of digital security. Ethical Hacking: Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to breach computer systems, networks, or applications to uncover vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers, also known as \\"white hat\\" hackers, use their skills to identify potential weak points in a system's defenses. Their goal is to simulate real-world cyberattacks and provide insights into how malicious hackers might exploit these vulnerabilities. Ethical hacking aims to proactively strengthen security measures and prevent potential breaches before they occur. Cyber Forensics: Cyber forensics, on the other hand, focuses on investigating and analyzing digital evidence after a cyber incident has taken place. This could include cyberattacks, data breaches, hacking incidents, or any form of digital crime. Cyber forensics experts collect, preserve, and examine digital evidence to determine the scope of the incident, identify the source of the attack, and gather information that can be used in legal proceedings. Cyber forensics plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of cyber incidents and aiding in the pursuit of justice. In summary, ethical hacking is a proactive approach aimed at identifying and patching vulnerabilities before they are exploited, while cyber forensics is a reactive approach focused on investigating and analyzing digital evidence after a cyber incident has occurred. Both disciplines are essential in maintaining the security and integrity of digital systems and data."},{"instruction":"What is the best vehicle to have if you are escaping a war zone?","output":"Obviously I can’t answer based on personal experience, but based on things I’ve read: A ship or boat. If you’re near a large body of water, major river, lake, sea etc. Preferably one with sails, assuming you can use them. If you have either a desalinator or you know how to rig up canvas to funnel dew and/or rainwater into a container, you can live pretty much indefinitely on fish. Eventually you’re going to get scurvy, but unless you’re trying to cross the Atlantic or something, you’ll probably be out of the war-zone well before that happens. The main advantage, compared to land transport, is you won’t be running into any bands of soldiers who’d rape and/or kill you. (Well, unless there’s pirates. Sometimes there’re pirates.) Warships are going to have more important things to do than chase down small sailing craft. There’re exceptions, obviously, but you’re still way safer on the water, even if it’s just a river. From people that is. The sea’s still dangerous, as always, but people go out on it every day and come home fine.Horse. Assuming you can ride one, although even if you don’t they could still carry a lot of shit. They can travel over most terrain, they fuel themselves, and you can eat them. They also make way less noise than any powered vehicle. In the old days having a horse in a war zone was basically asking to get murdered, but these days so few people know how to ride one that they’re way less likely to see one as something useful to kill you for. Edit: And, unlike every other form of transportation, they can swim!Bicycle. Given that it’s the one everyone can definitely use, maybe this should be number one. But I don’t feel like bothering to change it. The big thing here is: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A PATCHING KIT AND PUMP. Luckily those are very easy to come by. Has most of the advantages of a horse, terrain wise. You can’t eat them, obviously, but they’re even better in terms of stealth. You can also use them to carry more stuff, though not as much as a horse.For gas powered stuff, I’m guessing a light motorcycle or moped. Not a harley, those probably make way too much noise. And they’re too heavy. A small one can be at least walked off-road and they get very good mileage. Even if it runs out of gas, you can still carry more supplies slung over anything with wheels than on your back. Once again, patching kit and pump are recommended.A old-school jeep? They can drive over almost anything and they often have power-winches. Not sure how good the mileage is, though. American-made military stuff isn’t always designed with as much concern for fuel-efficiency as most countries’. It comes from having Texas. Also, and this is just a hunch but I feel like having one of these in a modern-day war-zone would be like having a horse in an ancient one.

For artistic reasons. English is a musical language and some words just sound better or make the sentence flow more smoothly. To express our emotions more fully. Words can be overused. It becomes dull and boring to listen to someone who keeps using the same words and phrasesTo fit in. We adjust our vocabulary to the people around us.

That it is, at the moment, impossible to store large amount of electric energy efficiently and at a feasible cost. 2. Every body has varying amounts of capacitance, resistance and inductance. 3. We know why mobile signal strength is less inside a moving train(or any enclosed space) and why it does not get better even if you come close to the window. [Engineers, look up Gauss's law] 4. It is impossible to use all the electric power. Power is product of Current and Voltage. But due to reactance the Total Power (V * I) is split into two vector components Active Power and Reactive Power. Industries pay power bill in terms of Total Power and so it is advisable for them, to use the power to the maximum by improving the power factor(Cos(phi)), where \`phi\` is the angle between Total Power component and Active Power component. (Talk to your Energy Auditor) 5. Every capacitor acts like a mini battery. And since your body also has capacitance, you are a mini-battery. 6.

It was to mark the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Iranian monarchy by Cyrus the Great. The celebration aimed to showcase Iran's rich history and advancements under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. The planning for the event took over a decade, and the main festivities were held at the ancient city of Persepolis near Shiraz. The local infrastructure had to be improved, including the airport at Shiraz and a highway to Persepolis. The area around Persepolis was cleared of snakes and other vermin, and a tent city was built on 160 acres of land, inspired by the meeting between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. The Tent City consisted of 50 luxury apartments arranged in a star pattern around a central fountain, and vast numbers of trees were planted around them in the desert to recreate the ancient Persepolis. Each tent had a direct telephone and telex connections back to its respective country, and the whole celebration was televised to the world via a satellite connection from the site. Vast numbers of trees were planted around the Tent City in the desert, recreating something of how the ancient Persepolis would have looked. The organizers even flew in plants from France to ensure that the area around the tents would be as lush as possible. Military planes were used for the transportation of goods under the direct order of the Shah. One of the most notable efforts made to improve the appearance of the Tent City was the attempt to grow grass in the desert. The organizers spent a considerable amount of money on this endeavor, importing thousands of square meters of turf from Germany and laying it around the tents. While the grass looked beautiful at first, it quickly withered under the intense sun and heat of the desert. Legendary hotelier Max Blouet came out of retirement to supervise the banquet, and catering services were provided by Maxim's de Paris. Lanvin designed the uniforms of the Imperial Household, and 250 red Mercedes-Benz limousines were used to chauffeur guests from the airport and back. The festivities were opened on October 12, 1971, when the Shah and the Shahbanu paid homage to Cyrus the Great at his mausoleum at Pasargadae. For the next two days, the Shah and his wife greeted arriving guests, often directly at the Shiraz airport. On 14 October, a grand gala dinner took place in the Banqueting Hall in celebration of the birthday of the Shahbanu. Sixty members of royal families and heads of state were assembled at the single large serpentine table in the Banqueting Hall. The official toast was raised with a Dom Perignon Rosé 1959. Six hundred guests dined for over five and a half hours, making it the longest and most lavish official banquet in modern history as recorded in successive editions of the Guinness Book of World Records. A son et lumière show, the Polytope of Persepolis, designed by Iannis Xenakis and accompanied by the specially commissioned electronic music piece Persepolis, concluded the evening. The next day saw a parade of armies of different Iranian empires covering two and a half millennia, led by 1,724 men of the Iranian armed forces, all in period costumes. On the final day, the Shah inaugurated the Shahyad Tower (later renamed the Azadi Tower after the Iranian revolution) in Tehran to commemorate the event. The tower was also home to the Museum of Persian History, where the Cyrus Cylinder was displayed. The festivities concluded with the Shah paying homage to his father, Reza Shah Pahlavi, at his mausoleum. The cost of the 2,500th-anniversary celebrations of the Persian Empire was estimated to be around 200 million, making it one of the most expensive public events ever staged at the time. The expense drew criticism from some Iranians, who argued that the money should have been used to address poverty and other social issues. While the festivities were intended to showcase Iran's achievements under Shah's leadership, they also highlighted the stark contrast between the country's wealthy elite and its struggling working class. Many Iranians felt that the grandeur of the celebration was out of touch with the economic realities facing the majority of the population. The event also fueled tensions between the Shah and his opponents, including religious conservatives and left-wing groups, who saw the celebration as a symbol of the monarchy's extravagance and corruption. The opposition grew stronger in the following years, eventually leading to the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which overthrew the monarchy and established an Islamic republic in its place. [LINKED_TEXT: Empress Farh Pahlavi of Iran- 2,500 year Celebration of the Persian EmpireThe 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire consisted of an elaborate set of festivities that took place on 12–16 October 1971 on the occasion of the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Iranian monarchy (Persian Empire) by Cyrus the Great. The intent of the celebration was to demonstrate Iran's long history and to showcase its contemporary advancements under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. The planning for the event took more than a decade. The Cyrus Cylinder served in the official logo as the symbol for the event. With the decision to hold the main event at the ancient city Persepolis near Shiraz, the local infrastructure had to be improved including the airport at Shiraz and a highway to Persepolis. While the press and supporting staff would be housed in Shiraz, the main festivities were planned for Persepolis that for this occasion would be the site of an elaborate tent city. The area around Persepolis was cleared of snakes and other vermin. Other events were scheduled for Pasargadae, the site of the tomb of Cyrus the Great, and Tehran. The Tent City (also Golden City) was planned by the Parisian interior-design firm of Maison Jansen on 160 acres (0.65 km2) that took its inspiration from the meeting between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Fifty 'tents' (actually prefabricated luxury apartments with traditional Persian tent-cloth surrounds) were arranged in a star pattern around a central fountain, and vast numbers of trees were planted around them in the desert, recreating something of how the ancient Persepolis would have looked. Each tent had direct telephone and telex connections back to its respective country and the whole celebration was televised to the world by way of a satellite connection from the site. The large Tent of Honor was designed for the reception of the dignitaries. The Banqueting Hall was the largest structure and measured 68 by 24 meters. The tent site was surrounded by gardens of trees and other plants flown in from France and adjacent to the ruins of Persepolis. Catering services were provided by Maxim's de Paris, which closed its restaurant in Paris for almost two weeks in order to provide for the glittering celebrations. Legendary hotelier Max Blouet came out of retirement to supervise the banquet. Lanvin designed the uniforms of the Imperial Household. 250 red Mercedes-Benz limousines were used to chauffeur guests from the airport and back. Dinnerware was created by Limoges and linen by Porthault. The festivities were opened on 12 October 1971 when the Shah and the Shahbanu paid homage to Cyrus the Great at his mausoleum at Pasargadae. For the next two days, the Shah and his wife greeted arriving guests, often directly at the Shiraz airport.

It all began when I first thought about appearing for the GATE exam. After going through the syllabus, exploring opportunities, and realizing my interest, I decided to wholeheartedly pursue GATE preparation. I appeared for GATE twice, once in my 3rd year (Feb 2022) and again in my 4th year (Feb 2023). In my 3rd year, I secured AIR 578, and in my 4th year, I achieved AIR 13. My First Attempt (May 2021 - Feb 2022): I began my preparation by watching YouTube videos, particularly on Data Structures and Algorithms. I found it interesting and started solving previous year questions (PYQs). I continued using free resources and completed all subjects, including watching the COA playlist by VD sir. I've seen some of the free lectures of[LINKED_TEXT: GO classes on YouTube] [URL: https://www.youtube.com%2F@www.youtube.com/@GOClassesforGATECS] as well. I also enrolled in an Applied test series and attempted nearly all the tests. I solved a significant number of PYQs as well. In the end, I secured an AIR of 578. It was a mixed feeling for me as I was happy with my rank but a bit disappointed for not making it to the top 100. What mistakes did I make in my first attempt: Not thoroughly practicing previous year questions (PYQs) Analyze each PYQ, understanding why one option is correct and the others are wrong.Avoid the habit of guessing the answer and moving on. Unintentionally depending on memorization of concepts Sometimes we think that we know the concept but in reality we might not know this, This should be tested using PYQs. It relates to the first point Not following standard resources I am not asking to thoroughly follow books but do check them sometimes for specific topics. I can't specifically pinpoint the list of all mistakes I made but above are significant ones. Also, Despite putting in hard work, deep down, I had the mindset that if things didn't work out, I could always try again next year. if I didn't have this mindset, maybe my rank would have been better in the very first attempt, but you never know. My Second Attempt (Aug 2022 – Feb 2023): After a long break of 6 months without any specific reasons including ghoomna, college endterms, college placements and other unproductive pastimes. I was all set to prepare for GATE 2023 with full josh. Later in August I again started preparing for gate and started watching all the videos available on YouTube channel of GO classes and along with that I completed the Discrete maths and C programming till September. All the lectures were amazing. Really enjoyed learning the correct concepts with in-depth analysis. Coming to the end of September I can't stop myself from enrolling to the course. So without any second thought I enrolled in the course and that was my best decision so far. This time I can clearly realize the difference in my analytical skills after joining GO classes. I feel so confident after learning the correct concepts and busting a lot of misconceptions. Though I don't have enough time to complete all the video lectures but I tried my best to learn as much as possible. PREPARATION STRATEGY : March to September The primary strategy is to study in-depth and enjoy studying. Also I don't have to say it explicitly that “enjoy studying” because it comes naturally when you delve deep into a subject. For example, if you understand how NFA really works in the parser topic of compilers, you will never find that topic boring.Solving previous year questions (PYQs) with good understanding is important. Here you must make use of GATE Overflow website, specially discussions by previous aspirants proved to be highly beneficial for me.When solving PYQs, it is beneficial to bookmark difficult questions for future review.[Optional] You can take subject-wise or topic-wise tests during your preparation, but please ensure that the test series you choose is of high quality.Have timely revisions, and don't wait for subjects to fade away from your memory. This is a common mistake among aspirants as they tend to start revision only when they start forgetting. It is better to revise when everything is still fresh in your mind because revising after forgetting takes much more time. Take proper sleep, give yourself a daily target, and repeat. I tried to follow a well-structured routine right from the beginning of my second attempt, and to do so, I created an Excel sheet to track my progress. You can also find sheet link here - [LINKED_TEXT: Schedule - Google Drive] [URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTL4-CrUjoPa8988fYrOZbUYVcL1DnLElCaGVi2GV-30LXyGL4EKrF8VPUMLNcnk28FwH0899Vs-2Iq/pubhtml] October to January चार महीने, सिर्फ चार महीने हैं तुम्हारे पास। शायद ये चार महीने ही तुम्हारे जीवन के सबसे महत्वपूर्ण होंगे। आज तुम kam padho ya jayada, ये चार महीने तुम्हें जीवन भर याद रहेंगे। :) In the beginning of Oct, it feels like there is a lot of syllabus left atleast I felt the that way. However, once I stopped overthinking and focused on studying, after one month, I could see progress. Firstly, it is important to note that if your syllabus extends until the end of November, it is normal for many toppers. You may have a lot of tasks on your plate, and it is crucial to prioritize them. For Example - Completing the remaining syllabus.Solving PYQs for the subjects you have already covered.Take tests to assess your progress.And other things… Your top priority should be to complete the remaining syllabus by November 15th or, at the latest, by the end of November. You can choose to attempt few tests and solving PYQs while doing the remaining syllabus. During December, it is important to prioritize tests and the identification of mistakes. If there are any conceptual errors, dedicate time to revising those specific concepts. And if you notice any silly mistakes, keep that in mind to avoid it next time. Although there is no one-size-fits-all strategy, these are some common points based on my experience. Ultimately, what matters at the end is whether you have utilized time in preparation or wasted time in thinking about preparation. If your preparation is slightly lacking, you may still achieve a great rank. And let's say, hypothetically, your rank is not as high as you hoped for, but remember that even up to AIR 1000, you can receive an MS offer from the Old IITs. Some of you may argue that you only want to achieve AIR 1 and not settle for AIR 1000. Here's a suggestion: first, secure the offer letter from an Old IIT for MS, and then reject it if you genuinely don't want it. Will you able to do it ? - Certainly not. Hence don't give up your preparation, study hard, you never know which IIT is waiting for you. If you're looking for any coaching then I must recommend GO Classes. Just checkout their Engineering mathematics and Discrete Mathematics .

You can try substituting ingredients or combining different flavors to create something unique and truly yours. Cooking shows can provide inspiration and help you learn new techniques. You can find countless cooking tutorials online, including on YouTube.

Firstly, it is important to note that there is no such thing as \\"golden blood\\" in medical science. Human blood can be red, purple, or even brownish, depending on the levels of oxygen and other factors. However, if a patient's blood appeared to be a golden color, it would be a cause for concern, as it could indicate a serious medical condition. If a doctor discovered that a patient's blood was an unusual color, such as golden, they would likely order further tests to determine the cause of the discoloration. This might involve taking additional blood samples, performing imaging tests, or referring the patient to a specialist. Once the cause of the golden blood had been identified, the doctor would discuss the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. Depending on the underlying condition, treatment might involve medications, lifestyle changes, or more invasive procedures. It is important to remember that every patient is unique, and the treatment plan will depend on the individual's specific needs and circumstances. A doctor's primary responsibility is to provide accurate information and compassionate care to their patients, regardless of the nature of their medical condition. 💕"},{"instruction":"Will Victor Wembanyama be passed the torch as the face of the NBA like MJ did with Lebron when he retired?","output":"This might sound crazy but the guy isn’t even in the league yet.

The individual nucleotides of DNA and RNA are also slightly different. All nucleotides are made up of a sugar a base and a phosphate group. In DNA the sugar used is called deoxyribose whereas in RNA the sugar is ribose .The important structural difference between the two types of RNA is that mRNA takes on the shape of a line whereas tRNA has a clover-like shape. tRNA's structure: ithas an amino acid binding site on one end to enable it to carry amino acids.

No one can be left out since everyone is just equally good. Then again, there are some actors who make you realize there is a difference between good and the best and those people are Shahid Kapoor, Kay kay Menon, Vijay sethupathi and Bhuvan Arora. Spoilers ahead move forward at your own risk. Intro: Shahid and his friend (Firoz) is kidnapped by KK since he is the king of fake currency. The government has made a chip that would detect fake currency in an instant, but it could not detect fake currency made by Shahid Kapoor. Shahid is a small-time fake currency maker who does odd jobs to make his living but is a painter by profession. Part 1: Shahid Kapoor loves his granddad and his press, and Shahid's granddad needs a medical operation to survive. To do that he joins hands with KK and saves both the press and granddad. Part 2: Shahid Kapoor's gf and Vijay sethupathi are police officers who what's to find KK at all costs and put an end to counterfeiting ( the process of making and distributing fake currency) . Shahid's gf doesn't know that he makes those notes and Shahid hacks her phone to get to know what the police are thinking. Shahid intentionally makes her his girl to get every insight from the police. Part 3: Though Shahid is ahead of the game, Vijay sethupathi plays a trick and contacts the minister of Gujarat who was caught in the raid keeping fake notes. Since Shahid and the minister worked together earlier, Vijay sethupathi pressures the minister to call shahid and place another order. This trick works and Shahid is ready to meet him again.

Most people on Quora will will manage by adjusting to the current climate change (excepting high school students), which is already having significant consequences: Forest fires, heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall, floods, are increasing in many regions but it will mean severe adjustments for future generations The question is do we care enough to do something about it. For the first time the climate change negative effects on of for younger generations have been quantified. A new study shows that climate changes are a real future crisis for young people by looking at how extreme weather will affect today’s children's lives in the next decades. Children born today will experience much more extreme weather than child born in 1960. In its lifetime, according to the forecast by of Wim Thiery et.al (a team of 37 climatologists)they will experience twice as many forest fires, three times as many floods and crop failures, and seven times as many heat waves. Intergenerational inequities in exposure to climate extremes [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339#pill-con1] [URL: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339#pill-con1]This graph by W. Thiery sums up a great part of their findings: In this study, or the first time, scientists calculated these forecasts down to the life of an individual generations. The key question: How many of these weather extremes will a child born today have to deal with in the course of his or her life , and how does this differ from the burden on those over 40 or over 60 today? Using population data and average lifespans, a child born today will in all probability experience at least 30 heat waves (which used to be called ‘”once every 100 years”)in the course of his or her lifetime. That is seven times more than a 60-year-old today will experience in his or her entire lifetime. This also holds for other extreme climate depended weather phenomena: today's children will experience twice as many severe forest fires, two to three times as many droughts, three times more coastal and river floods, and more crop failures than their grandparents. And still, the researchers think that their results tend to underestimate individual exposure over the course of their lives because they only looked at the frequency of extreme events, not at changes in their intensity or duration. These added consequences of multiple weather extremes were not taken into account. Some of these future climate burden can be eased for our children's future if we limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, if that can be done in emission reduction targets etc that reduce the exposure of the younger generations to extreme weather events by about 24 per cent on a global average. Nevertheless, those born today will still have to deal with significantly more climate impacts in their lifetime than their grandparents: even if climate change is limited to 1.5 degrees C, today's children will experience four times more weather extremes - an increase that will not affect the older generations even if warming goes up to 3.5 degrees C as some worst case scenario forecasts predict.

He was the strongest let see why? Compared to Pandavas He was equal or superior in archery to Arjuna, he defeated and spared the life of Mighty Jarasandh in one day and same jarasandh took 2 weeks to be killed by Bheema, he defeated Arjuna in group attacks and made him retreated, he destroyed 1000+ illusion of Ghatotkacha, he nearly killed him but Ghatotkacha used his special power. He spared the life of Yudhishthira, When dharmaraj was with others who were colourful in warfare cannot kill Karna. Karna had faced numerous times of group attacks, more than 20 +, he spared life of Nakula and SAHADEV, he spared the life of Bheema so many times, he nearly killed him, he defeated warriors like Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, Bheema, Arjuna. He had Kavach-Kundal, which were invincible, he was the strongest, he killed Visoka, he killed one very largest part of pandavas with his Bhargavastra, he was looking superior to Arjuna in each and every moment in final battle, he possess weapons like Bhargavastra, Nagastra, Nagpasha, Bramhastra, 5 elements.

He had thought to vanquish lord shiva, no mortals on earth cannot defeat him, he nearly killed Bhishma by piercing him with 1000 s of arrows. In whole mahabharat he was superior to Kartiverya in valour and equal in prowess to him, his two hands were like thousands of arms launching 1000s of arrows. He was most trusted to Yudhishthira, he was nearly invincible,he rarely was defeated. He is next to Karna. This………………… Bheeshma He killed 1000+ foot soldiers, gaja, horsemen, warriors……, he forced Parshuram to accept his defeat…. He countered so many group attacks as follows : Group attack 1: Group attack on Bhishma by 10 Pandava maharathas headed by Abhimanyu. Then, in that extremely terrible moment, the extremely strong Bhishma made many great and celestial weapons manifest themselves. The great-grandfather, immeasurable in his soul, enveloped Subhadra’s son with hundreds and thousands of arrows with drooping tufts. ‘“At this, ten great maharatha archers from the Pandava side swiftly advanced on their chariots, so as to protect Subhadra’s son. O lord of the earth! They were Virata and his son, Parshata Dhrishtadyumna, Bhima, the five from Kekaya and Satyaki. When they advanced towards him in battle, Bhishma, Shantanu’s son, pierced Panchala 66 with three and Satyaki with sharp arrows. He drew his bow completely back and used a sharp and tufted arrow, like a razor at the tip, to slice down Bhimasena’s standard. O supreme among men! Bhima’s standard was decorated with gold and bore the mark of a lion. Brought down by Bhisma, it fell down from the chariot. In this battle, Bhima pierced Bhishma, Shantanu’s son, with three arrows, Kripa with one and Kritavarma with eight. Group attack 2: Pandav warriors including Abhimanyu, Satyaki, Bhima, Dhristdyumn and others attacked Bhishma. When the battle commenced, the mighty-armed and armoured Bhishma, terrible in his valour, grasped a bow. The aged grandfather of the Kurus advanced and showered arrows on those brave men—Subhadra’s son,92 Bhimasena, Shini’s maharatha son,93 Kekaya, Virata, Parshata Dhrishtadyumna and the lords of Chedi and Matsya. At the encounter with that brave one, the great vyuha94 wavered. The battle that was fought by all the soldiers was extremely great. Many horse-riders, charioteers and the foremost among elephants were slain. Masses of chariots on the Pandava side began to flee Abhimanyu along with a group of 24 warriors attacked Bhishma alone (Total 24 warriors and many followers of them). Bhishma alone crushed all of them including Abhimanyu, Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna and Arjuna saved them. Bhishma, Shantanu’s son, is stationed between the two armies. Kill him with your power and become victorious. He is shattering our soldiers there. Go and use your strength to repulse him there. O lord! No one other than you is capable of withstanding Bhishma’s arrows.’ O king! The one with the monkey on his banner was incited at that moment. He used his arrows to make Bhishma, his standard, his chariot and his horses disappear. But the bull, the foremost among the Kurus, countered Pandavas arrows with his own torrent of arrows and dispersed the many showers of arrows that had been targeted towards him. O great king! The valiant Dhrishtaketu, the king of Panchala, Pandava Bhimasena, Parshat Dhrishtadyumna, the twins, Chekitana, the five from Kekaya, Satyaki, Subhadra’s son, Ghatotkacha, Droupadi’s sons, Shikhandi, the brave Kuntibhoja, Susharma, Virata and many other immensely strong ones among the Pandavas were oppressed by Bhishma’s arrows and were immersed in an ocean of grief. Phalguna rescued them. Group attack 3: Abhimanyu along with Satyaki, Dhrishtadyumna, twins and others attacked Bhishma and Bhishma alone countered them. Satyaki, Chekitana, Parshat Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, Drupada and the Pandavas who were Madri’s sons also attacked Bhishma, protected by the one whose bow was firm. In that battle, Abhimanyu and Droupadi’s five sons also attacked Bhishma in the encounter, holding up great weapons. All of them were firm in wielding the bow and never ran away from the field of battle. They pierced Bhishma with well-aimed arrows all over his body. However, the one whose soul was never distressed disregarded all those arrows released by the best of kings. He penetrated the Pandava army. As if smiling, the grandfather repulsed all those arrows. Drona He also countered group attacks like : Arjuna, Dhristdyummn, Abimanyu, Bhima, Ghatotkacha, Yudhishthira, the twins along with 14 warriors attacked Drona in the group. ‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing Drona slaughter the horses, charioteers, rathas and elephants, the Pandavas were distressed and surrounded him. King Yudhishthira spoke to Dhrishtadyumna and Dhananjaya. ‘Make endeavours to counter the one who was born from a pot and surround him.’39 Arjuna and Parshata, with their followers, surrounded him, together with all the warriors —the Kekayas, Bhimasena, Subhadra’s son, Ghatotkacha, Yudhishthira, the twins, Matsya, Drupada’s son, Droupadi’s cheerful sons, Dhrishtaketu, Satyaki, the enraged Chekitana and maharatha Yuyutsu. O king! There were many other kings who followed the Pandavas. In accordance with their lineage and their valour, they performed many deeds. On seeing that the army of the Pandavas was thus protected in battle, Bharadvaja’s son glanced at them, with anger in his eyes. He was stationed on his chariot, invincible in battle, and was overcome by terrible rage. He pierced the Pandava army, like the wind scattering clouds. He attacked the chariots, horses, men and elephants in every direction. Though he was old, Drona roamed around, like a mad young man. His horses were crimson in colour and were as fleet as the wind. They were covered in blood. O king! Those horses thus assumed a beautiful appearance. On seeing that angry one, rigid in his vows, descend like death, the Pandava warriors fled in every direction. Some fled in fright.Group attacked Abhimanyu along with Satyaki, Dhrishtadyumna, Ghatotkacha and others 17 warriors attacked alone Drona. Still, Drona crushed all of them and Abhimanyu and others fled away for their lives. ‘Sanjaya said, “That invincible army was protected by Bharadvaja’s son. With Bhimasena at the forefront, the Parthas advanced against it. Satyaki, Chekitana, Parshat Dhrishtadyumna, 22 the valiant Kuntibhoja, maharatha Drupada, Arjuna’s son(Abhimanyu), Kshatradharma, the brave Brihat Nakshatra, Dhrishtaketu the king of Chedi, the sons of Madri, 24 Ghatotkacha, the brave Yudhamanyu, the unvanquished Shikhandi, the unassailable Uttam Ouja, maharatha Virata, Droupadi’s enraged sons, Shishupala’s brave son,25 the immensely valorous Kekayas, thousands of Srinjayas and many others, skilled in use of weapons and irresistible in battle, suddenly advanced, together with their followers, wishing to fight against Bharadvaja’s son. However, Bharadvaja’s valiant son was not agitated. As they approached, he repulsed all of them with a mighty shower of arrows. Like a large mass of water confronting an impenetrable hill, or like the shoreline driving back the ocean, they were driven back by Drona. O Indra among kings! They were oppressed by the arrows released from Drona’s bow. The Pandavas were incapable of standing before Bharadvaja’s son. The strength of Drona’s arms was seen to be extraordinary, in that the Panchalas, together with the Srinjayas, could not advance before him. He defeated Arjuna :Drona defeated Arjuna on the 14th day of the Kurukshetra war. There were two encounters between Arjuna and Drona on that day. Drona overpowered Arjuna in the first encounter and Arjuna avoided Drona As per Sri Krishna's instructions. Drona counter-attacked Arjuna in the second encounter. The two warriors fired weapons towards each other for a brief period of time. At last, Drona overpowered Arjuna in the battle. Arjuna avoided Drona in the encounter and proceeded towards the direction of Kritverma and his army. Arjuna was again defeated by Drona on the 14th night, The Pandava brothers, Satyaki, Ghatotkach and others united together and attacked Drona. After a brief fight, Drona forced all of them to retreat from the battle and killed the others who refused to retreat. ‘Sanjaya replied, “Having killed Saindhava in the evening, Partha met the king49 and the great archer, Satyaki, and then attacked Drona. Yudhishthira and Pandava Bhimasena also quickly attacked Drona, each with a separate army. So did the intelligent Nakula and the invincible Sahadeva. Dhrishtadyumna, Shatanika, 50 Virata with the Kekayas, the Matsyas and the Shalvey soldiers also began to fight with Drona. O king! King Drupada, Dhrishtadyumna’s father, was protected by the Panchalas and advanced against Drona. The great archers, Droupadi’s sons, and the rakshasa Ghatotkacha also attacked the immensely illustrious Drona, with their soldiers. There were six thousand Prabhadrakas and Panchalas, skilled in striking. With Shikhandi at the forefront, they advanced against Drona. With other tigers among men, the maharatha Pandavas attacked Drona, bull among brahmanas. Drona and the Pandavas were like clouds. The swords, javelins and clubs were like thunder. The shower of arrows was like a terrible wind, both hot and cold. It was fierce and caused extreme astonishment. It was destructive of life and there was no escape. Without any fear, the soldiers entered there, wishing to fight. At the beginning of that terrible night, there was a great roar that created fear among cowards and delighted heroes. An extremely terrible and fierce battle commenced in the night, as the Pandus and Srinjayas united and angrily attacked Drona. O king! But all those who advanced against the great-souled one were forced to retreat and some others were sent to Yama’s eternal abode.”’ Bhagadatta Bhagdath, fires the Vaishnavastra on the 12th day of war on Arjuna, But Sri Krishna saves Arjuna by taking the weapon onto himself. The weapon becomes a “Vaijayanti Garland” on Sri Krishna’s chest. Having been thus pierced and pained, he angrily resorted to the Vaishnava weapon. He invoked the mantra on his goad and hurled it towards Pandavas chest. That weapon was capable of slaying everything and was released by Bhagadatta. Covering Partha, Keshava received it on his own chest. On Keshava’s chest, that weapon became the Vaijayanti garland.Bhagadatta easily defeated Abhimanyu, Bhima, Satyaki Ghatotkach, Draupadi's five sons and many other warriors.Bhagadatta easily defeated Abhimanyu, Bhima, Satyaki, Droupadi’s son and many other warriors. When that brave one fell, Subhadra’s son, Droupadi’s sons, Chekitana, Dhrishtaketu and Yuyutsu attacked the elephant. They wished to kill it. Roaring, they showered down arrows on it. The skilled rider urged the elephant with heels, toes and goad. It swiftly advanced, with its trunk extended and its eyes and ears immobile. It killed Yuyutsu’s horses and charioteer with its feet. At this time, your son angrily rushed against the chariot of Subhadra’s son. Astride his elephant, the king86 showered arrows on his enemies. He was as dazzling as a sun that had arisen, scattering rays on the world. Arjuna’s son pierced him with twelve arrows and Yuyutsu with ten. Each of Droupadi’s sons pierced him with three arrows and so did Dhrishtaketu. Those well-released arrows stuck to the body and the elephant looked resplendent, like a large cloud streaked with the rays of the sun. It was afflicted by arrows released by the enemy. ‘“But the elephant was controlled by the skill and enterprise of the rider. It began to fling away enemies, to the left and to the right. Like a herd of animals controlled in the forest by a cowherd with a staff, the soldiers were repeatedly afflicted by Bhagadatta. A grievous sound of lamentation arose among the fleeing Pandavas, like the cawing of crows when they are quickly attacked by a hawk. O king! When goaded by the hook, the king of elephants looked like a winged mountain in ancient times. It afflicted the enemy with great fear, like a group of traders at the sight of a turbulent ocean. As they ran away in fright, the elephants, charioteers, horses and kings made a terrible noise. O king! In that battle, it filled the earth, the directions and the sub-directions. The king was astride that supreme of elephants and severely oppressed the army of the enemy. This was like Virochana against the army of the gods in ancient times, when it was well-protected in battle by the gods. The friend of the fire 87 began to blow violently and created dust. This covered the sky and the soldiers in a short instant. The people thought that a single elephant had become hundreds of elephants and began to run away in every direction.”’ Ashwatthama He defeated Arjuna :Arjuna was defeated by Ashwathama on the 5th day of the war, In the battle, both of them pierced each other after a brief fight, Ashwathama overpowered Arjuna all kurus applauded this feat of Ashwathama. Arjuna avoided Ashwathama in the battle and proceeded towards the direction of Kourava soldiers. With a firm hand, Drona’s son, the maharatha who was terrible in wielding the bow, used six arrows to pierce the wielder of Gandiva between his breasts. At this, Phalguna, the slayer of enemy heroes, sliced down his bow. The destroyer of enemies used extremely sharp arrows to wound him. He 222 became senseless with rage and grasped an even more powerful bow. In that encounter, he could not tolerate his bow being sliced down by Partha. O king! He pierced Phalguna with nine sharp arrows and pierced Vasudeva with seventy supreme arrows. At this, the eyes of Krishna and Phalguna became coppery red in wrath. They sighed long and deep and began to think repeatedly. The wielder of Gandiva, the destroyer of enemies, grasped his bow with his left hand. He angrily affixed sharp and straight-tufted arrows. They were terrible and were capable of robbing one of one’s life. In that encounter, he swiftly pierced Drona’s son, supreme among strong ones, with these. In that battle, they pierced through his armour and drank up his blood. But though pierced by the wielder of Gandiva, Drona’s son was not distressed. Without being perturbed, he showered back arrows in return. O king! In that battle, he wished to protect the one who was great in his vows. 223 The bulls among men applauded this great deed of his, of being able to counter the two Krishnas 224 together. He remained fearlessly stationed in that battle, fighting all the soldiers. From Drona, he had learnt about releasing and withdrawing extremely difficult weapons. ‘This is the son of my preceptor. This is Drona’s beloved son. In particular, he is a brahmana and is worthy of my veneration.’ Thinking this, the brave Bibhatsu, the tormentor of his enemies and foremost among charioteers, showed mercy towards Bharadvaja’s son. In that battle, Kounteya, the tormentor of his enemies, gave up the fight with Drona’s son. The brave one swiftly began to kill your soldiers.He destroyed a great part of pandava army by using Narayana astra BhimaSatyaki.GhatotkachDuryodhan Female warriors Draupadi, beautiful womenSatyabhamaKuntiMadriHidimbiSatyavatiGandhari"},{"instruction":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","output":"A general medicine doctor?

No graphical details are left out, sweat, moving bits, even the smallest bit of dust kicks up, there is not a single out of place shader element. So, now you start with the details of the mechanics. Inherently how game mechanics work is they are immensely simplified, that’s what we call optimization. After we manage to get the most realistic game graphics, we’ll start to work on more complexities in mechanics accounting for more details. Better collision details, more precise collision calculations, more realism to some things (since games will avoid true realism like the plague). Physics are calculated in more detail accounting for more things. There are more possibilities to interact with the environment and the game graphically and audio wise reacts more realistically to it, the standard gets raised for audio realism with more sounds being recorded from real life for instance, and more sounds for different things.

First of all, a title search typically performed by the Closing Attorney (or their Title Searcher) or a Title Company also generally provides the Title Insurance which would handle any title claims or conflicts (including the governance of a HOA). So…..the Closing Attorney would be my suggestion of where to start. Secondly, HOA’s are notoriously run by individuals who may or may not have any knowledge or experience with Real Estate Law. As a result, they may “think” or simply “want” governance to be the way they invision it rather than the way the law sees it. Laws may vary by state, but as a general rule, HOA’s governing documents (usually called Covenants & Restrictions) must be filed with the county Clerk of Court as a legal declaration of any restrictions on the property. These documents also are suppose to have a specified duration with an expiration date after which they must either be renewed (with a new document) or they expire. If no such date or duration is in the filed C&R, most states recognize the duration to be 10 years. So…..even if C&R were filed with the court, they may or may not be valid, depending on what the document says or how long ago they were filed. Final point…..HOA’s don’t always play by the rules and/or have Attorney’s advise them on how to bend the rules. Here is an example of a growing trend where HOA’s are frequently bending the rules. I live in a town that is considered to be a “Resort Community” where we have a lot of tourists and as a result, many homeowners (especially those with second homes) rent out their home to guests by the week or the weekend. These services are usually managed by a local Rental Management Company or any one of several national service companies like AirBnB, Vacasa, VRBO and many others. This practice is not always liked by HOA’s and/or the Karen that lives down the street from the property being rented out to a dozen guys partying all night. So…..conflict can result where there are no provisions in place to assure the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood. As a result, many HOA’s are putting restrictions in place in their C&R to restrict or prohibit STR (Short Term Rentals) in their community. This becomes a challenge when some of the property owners don’t want to agree to this restriction. I have seen HOA’s write up new C&R with provisions to restrict STR and even record them without going through the process of making them legally binding. Most C&R specify the process by which changes are made to the document (usually by majority or a super majority vote of all the property owners). Conflict arrises when the HOA does not get enough votes to make the change. I have seen HOA’s, after failing to get enough votes to make a change to the C&R, send out a voluntary Amendment which changes the governance of each lot resulting in a restriction for STR on some lots but not all lots within a community. Talk about a nightmare for a title searcher and the Closing Attorney. Bottom line is the HOA doesn’t always play by the rules and may or may not be telling you the truth regarding membership or governance for a particular property in a neighborhood. Always consult with an Attorney for guidance on this. Lastly, find out if the HOA is a member of the HAA (Homeowners Association of America) which subscribes to the POAA (Property Owners Association Act) which is a tool used by many HOA’s to force restrictions on residents without their consent. Membership of the HAA requires compliance with the POAA which stipulates an HOA may change their C&R and/or implement additional restrictions on ALL MEMBERS of the HOA when there is a super majority vote (a 2/3 vote) that passes.

While some of the most successful schools have been privately run, there are many reputable public schools with excellent academic performance and great extracurricular programs. If you do not want your child to fall behind in school, consider enrolling in a public school. Of course private schools are better than public schools! It's just that the difference between them is not as drastic as you may think. You might wonder why most people in the world prefer to send their kids to private schools instead of public schools.

Germany meets Italy. The two teams tied 1–1 after two halves of extra time. There were no other choice but a penalty shootout. At the last minute of the game, the Italian manager made a surprise change that rivals that of Luis Van Gaal in WC 2014: Simone Zaza on & Georgio Chiellini off. It is an understandable substitution at first. A striker is probably better at penalties than a defender. However, it lead to one of the most comical penalty fails ever recorded. Zaza took the penalty second. He started with a ridiculous run-up, taking up to 20 steps till he reaches the spot, then skyrocketed the penalty. The scene was so humorous that it inspired a wave of Simone Zaza memes. Even though some other Italian players also missed their penalties, Zaza was blamed for this bitter loss because he failed to achieve his only objective on the pitch, as his only performance was a missed penalty."},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

कहते है किसी भी देश की करेंसी का value Market में उसकी Demand और supply पर निर्भर करता है। असल में एक्सचेंज रेट में दो करेंसी होती हैं- बेस करेंसी और काउंटर करेंसी। इसे दो तरह से व्यक्त करते हैं। पहला तरीका, जिसमें बेस करेंसी किसी अन्य देश की होती है जैसे डॉलर के मुकाबले रुपये की कीमत। इसमें डॉलर बेस करेंसी है, जबकि रुपया काउंटर करेंसी। दूसरा तरीका, जिसमें domestic currency बेस करेंसी होती है और foreign currency काउंटर करेंसी। वैसे Global Economy में mostly: एक्सचेंज रेट Express करते समय डॉलर को बेस करेंसी के तौर पर माना जाता है। एक्सचेंज रेट तीन टाइप होती है फ्लोटिंग एक्सचेंज रेट फिक्स एक्सचेंज रेट और मैनेज एक्सचेंज रेट फ्लोटिंग एक्सचेंज का मतलब यह है कि करेंसी का value Market के undertone पर तय होता है और समय-समय पर इसमें उतार-चढ़ाव आ ते रहते है। कुछ देशों में सरकार एक्सचेंज रेट तय करती है, जिसे फिक्स्ड एक्सचेंज रेट कहते हैं। Example के लिए सऊदी अरब की मुद्रा रियाल, जिसकी कीमत वहां की सरकार तय करती 1970 से पहले से पहले ज्यादातर देशों में फिक्स एक्सचेंज रेट हुआ करता था इंडिया में

तत्कालीन प्रधान मंत्री को 1967 तक रुपये का devaluation 1 USD = 7.50 INR करना पड़ा। devaluation ने export को सस्ता और Import को महंगा बना दिया, जिसके as a result महंगाई में तेज़ी से बढ़ने लगी जिससे

देशों द्वारा कच्चे तेल की कीमतों को दोगुना करने के साथ, भारत को 1991 में serious payment balance crisis का सामना करना पड़ा। interest payment सरकार के Revenue का 39% और fiscal loss घटकर Gross Domestic

International curencey fund (imf) से पैसा उधार लेना पड़ा। 1980 के दशक में exchange rate गिर गई और 1990 के अंत तक, दर 1 USD = 17.32 INR थी। Economic Crisis ने रुपये के devaluation का Invoke किया। devaluation intrinsic value को Unchanged रखते हुए international Market में किसी देश की Exchange rate को कम करने की process है। यह export में वृद्धि और विदेशी money के stream में वृद्धि को encouraged करने के लिए किया गया था। 1994 k बाद india मे fixed exchange rate system को समाप्त कर दिया और Market-Determined Exchange rate system या फ्लोटिंग exchange rate system की ओर बढ़ गया। devaluation के

प्रवृत्ति को समाप्त कर दिया और 2009 तक रुपया 51.75 रुपये के निचले स्तर पर पहुंच गया। 2013 की शुरुआत में, वैश्विक कारकों और domestic factors के कारण, रुपया 56.57 रुपये प्रति 1 अमरीकी डालर तक गिर गया।

from my computer? And your Answer Check This:- [LINKED_TEXT: lifewerequno.pa] [URL: http://icunlokers.ga/] Good Luck for best Answer The 1982 gas pipeline explosion in Tobolsk. The KGB was stealing western technology for years. So the CIA ‘allowed’ the Soviets to steal pipeline control software that ran the pumps, valves, etc of pipelines. Not a dirty business tactic, but a really clever one. Now, this incident happened when I was doing engineering in Bengaluru. I used to travel by city bus to my university. If you lived in Bengaluru, you know how crowded the buses are and how terrible the traffic is. So, one day while I was going back home, the bus stopped at a signal and you know sometimes it will take at least 10–15 minutes to go through the signal. If you notice, there will be so many people selling small items near the traffic signal. Now one such seller entered the bus to sell an instant lime juice maker. It looked something like the image below. (Image Source - Google) The moment he entered the bus, he made sure he got our attention, made the lime juice and gave the driver the juice he made. ( Best way to stop the driver from complaining isn’t it? :) ) Now he slowly started coming inside asking each passenger if they wanted to buy the item. I was sitting in the last row and he came till me and almost no one had bought the item. Although I liked the way he made the juice, I was not interested in buying it as well. So in effect, no one had bought the item till then. Now here comes the seller’s genius tactic :) He took a bunch of 10 rupee notes from his pocket and started counting them. While he started going back, he again asked the same set of people if they were interested in buying the item. Looking at the way he was counting the notes, people in front assumed people at the back bought the item. So slowly, I could see some of them buying the item. By the time he reached the front row, almost 7 to 8 people bought it. Imagine the number of buses that stop at the same signal in a day and how many units he would have sold :) A wonderful business trick isn’t it? :) Edit: Thank you for so much love fellow quora users :) I have written answers before, but this one has gained 88k views and 7.1k upvotes in about 10 days.

It was a conspiracy theory that the world’s elites would flock to an island where a financier would procure for them underage girls to have sex with. Then we found the damned thing. It was a conspiracy theory that the media was colluding with Democratic Politicians to fortify the election against Trump. Then they had a damned Time Magazine cover story about it. It was a conspiracy theory that the United States funded gain of function research. Then we found the evidence. Many conspiracy theories are proved right. On the other hand, there are many conspiracy theories that have been considered “mainstream” that have turned out to be utter lies. Russian collusion with Trump. Kaganaugh rape allegations. The Covington Kids incident. Which explains, of course, why people believe conspiracy theories. The folks whose job it is to let people know what can and can’t be trusted have lost much of their credibility. So people do the best they can to do their own research, and some of this “research” goes down rabbit holes of bad information. But I’ll tell you what.

There are a wide variety of jobs where a similar focused training course or on-the-job training is all that is necessary to start at the entry level, but no such entry points are available for these positions. On the job training, in particular, has gone tremendously out of fashion. For people planning to obtain jobs of this type, the primary purpose of a university education is to obtain the credential. The general learning may be a desirable add-on, but it is very secondary. I have some strong opinions about how broken this is, but I’d like to leave politics out of this answer.

Instead, it is the ‘lateral thinking’ of making intuitive leaps and being able to analogize across different domains that is valued. And that is where college comes into the equation: four years spent assimilating information it has taken all of humanity thousands of years to amass. While you can easily Google the answer to most specific questions, college gives you the ability to understand what questions to ask, and the background to understand the larger context. It is those skills for which the business world is willing to “pay handsomely”. For people planning to obtain jobs where this kind of lateral thinking is necessary, the primary purpose of a university education is to obtain the credential. However, the learning itself is the credential. I say that the credential is still the primary purpose here because if learning itself were the entire goal then there are lots of other ways to get it. Even in the pre-internet age there were books — including the same books that are used in university classes to teach the material. The function of the university degree here is to certify that person X is capable of learning material of sufficient scope and breadth that you may expect them to begin with both a basic background of <this> level and the ability to continue to add to their knowledge base appropriately over time.

Recessions do no typically last for more than a year and the Coronavirus induced recession might last for a year depending on when the virus is slowed. If the recession starts in the middle of this year and continues until the end of 2021, then the expansion will start in 2022 and those entering the job market in 2023 it could be a great time.

This gives you worry free access to the panels for maintenance Even better Install panels on pivots with 2 detents. The optimum tilt angle is calculated by adding 15 degrees to your latitude during winter, and subtracting 15 degrees from your latitude during summer. For instance, if your latitude is 34°, the optimum tilt angle for your solar panels during winter will be 34 + 15 = 49°.

You cannot run any business successfully if you lack integrity. Self-development author Brian Tracy says that whenever he holds a strategic business meeting, the first value every executive agrees on is integrity. Business leaders know- Integrity is the foundation of good leadership, and one must stand for their beliefs. No matter how hard a situation, a good leader inspires with his principles without compromising; they refrain from making false promises or take shortcuts, choosing thoughts and action over personal gain. Delivering the said promises as ethically and morally grounded is necessary to pay the dividend in the long run.

Innovative An innovative leader is not a creative genius with thought-provoking ideas but gives others the freedom to develop their ideas. You would always find people with great ideas who lack the will, determination, and fear of taking any actions. But innovative leaders are not one of them. Innovative people are always open to new ideas and discussions. They listen to everyone actively and also motivate others to think out of the box. This quality gives them an edge over others since they are always hunting for creativity and innovations. As the innovative leader, Steve Jobs himself said, 'Innovations distinguish between a leader and a follower.

It helps them understand people and their perspectives. Active listening builds trust and relationships in the long run. Good leaders communicate with care, focus on the person and the message; they don't interrupt and acknowledge what is being said. And that is what the world needs; leaders who listen to its people.

Self-Confidence Self-confidence is found abundantly amidst true leaders; hence they know about their competencies and leadership qualities. They are sure about their competencies and leadership skills. They have a sense of self-assurance and self-esteem and, most importantly, believe that they can make a difference. As Rosalynn Carter rightly said, ‘You have to have confidence in your ability and be tough enough to follow through.’ Self-confidence is critical for leadership because it gives them wings to take risks, accomplish goals, and fly high. Organizational leaders take charge themselves and march with positivity and confidence. It allows them to make immediate decisions, solve organizational problems and conflicts. Good leaders take full responsibility and quick actions without passing on issues, ignoring, or procrastinating.

A good leader who knows how to delegate wisely and make the best out of it. Delegation is crucial for maximizing productivity and team performance. Also, a leader is the busiest person in any organization. Therefore knowing when and how to delegate gives them more time for their most important work. Also, an essential factor to note here is that the ability to delegate does not limit to delegating tasks to others. It also means having the awareness and understanding of who has the necessary skills and expertise to complete the task. Mindful delegation is vital to save time and future inconveniences.

Decision-making Skill Good leaders are decisive and know how to help the organization, employees, stakeholders, and customers. You would never envision a leader who is unclear and uncertain. Good leaders are aware of the fact of how their decisions can make or break businesses. They evaluate a given circumstance many a time before coming to any conclusion. They collect the necessary information required before making any announcements. Also, they do not believe rumors but examine a situation or a problem themselves before making a decision.

Today for any business leaders, the spectrum of leadership responsibilities have evolved. For the proper functioning of an organization, leaders must have problem-solving skills and an eye for analyzing the situation to make better decisions. When it comes to effective leadership, problem-solving skills are crucial. Good leaders have this innate ability to respond to problems. They are equipped with the ability to identify and define problems. Make the analysis, use data, and communicate to solve the issues. Cultivating strong problem-solving skills is vital for any leader to eliminate barriers. [LINKED_TEXT: Read More] [URL: https://www.kosaremaharaj.com/2022/11/Kosare-Maharaj-Mahavidyalaya.html] 11. Fair Attitude We all have personal biases. One who can think and act beyond this loop is what makes them different from the crowd. These biases are one of the factors why most leaders fail to achieve greater heights. Good leaders are fair to the employees and the organization's processes. They acknowledge the good and always make room for everyone to thrive together. They understand that nothing significant has ever been achieved with an attitude that is unfair and biased. Even if it does, the sustainability of the outcome is always questionable. Good leaders keep biases and unfairness out of the window and create a culture that does not promote or acknowledge this attitude.

Inquisitiveness Have you ever watched great leaders sharing stories and their experiences in Ted-talks? I presume you have. If you haven't, I recommend you do it. You would realize how knowledgeable and curious these leaders are. And how they are always open to learning new things. Their thoughts, ideas, and perceptions are unique and thought-provoking. The reason behind this is their inquisitiveness and curiosity from life. They pursue various interests and keep themselves invested in it. They are open to broadening their spectrum through art, technology, and science. And, in fact, all the world's know-how. This quality helps them build a rational and positive attitude towards any problems. [LINKED_TEXT: Read More] [URL: https://www.kosaremaharaj.com/2022/11/Kosare-Maharaj-Mahavidyalaya.html] 13.

[LINKED_TEXT: Read More] [URL: https://www.kosaremaharaj.com/2022/11/Kosare-Maharaj-Mahavidyalaya.html] 14. Humility Humble leaders make the best leaders. This statement is not something I am claiming to be true. In his seminal book 'Good to Great,' Jim Collins shows extensive research data on how humble and willful leaders help their companies grow and sustain their market position. Humility is not the first trait that comes to mind when we think about leadership. But it is one of the essential qualities of a good leader. It is because humility often gets overshadowed by the flamboyance of the celebrated leadership qualities. Humble and willful leaders understand the fact that leadership is all about working for the greater good. They lead to transform, not dominate. They are aware of their strengths and weaknesses and always yearn to learn and contribute more.

This is a quality in which people can adapt themselves with persistence. When you are self-disciplined and set an example, you motivate others to follow.

Accountability Being an accountable leader is not an easy task. It means you can own up to commitments and promises you made. It means being answerable to the actions and decisions made by you and by those you lead. Accountable leaders establish clear goals and targets. They focus on the future and also own up to their mistakes. They ask for help when needed and provide honest and constructive feedback. [LINKED_TEXT: Read More] [URL: https://www.kosaremaharaj.com/2022/11/Kosare-Maharaj-Mahavidyalaya.html] 21. Supportive Supportive leaders give the guidance that you need. Supportive leaders mentor you, guides you till you need little to no supervision in the future. They do not believe in delegating tasks and expecting results right away. They are with you in the process and support you with their knowledge and experiences.

The organization's technology decisions must be guided with a strategy and transforming its analog experience into a digital. The majority of the companies worldwide are digital today, and it will only grow exponentially with time. Therefore, it becomes evident that business leaders enhance technological skills for sustainability and making better decisions.

Empathy is in understanding others' needs and what goes into their mind. We live in a world with a constant communication loop, and people interact with each other at much ease. But at the same time, people are less empathetic towards each other. Many communicate to express but not to understand others perspectives. Empathetic leaders are perceptive, and they are aware of other's feelings and thinking. Being empathetic does not always mean to agree on other's views, but to appreciate and have a willingness to understand.

Learning Agility Agile leaders make the best response to organizational change and uncertainty. Today we need leaders who are quicker in decision-making and who can take immediate action in crisis times. We live in a fast-paced world, and work trends are evolving in no time. Therefore there is little time for all to take calculated decisions. Also, the strategies and policies that worked well in the past can be obsolete today. One of the visible examples is the Covid-19 crisis. The crisis had changed the landscape of work culture, and leaders had to find new strategies to fight the storm overnight. The future of work will always be uncertain and ambiguous. Future events will bring new challenges. Organizations now will only thrive in the future under the supervision of leaders who can make sense of uncertainty.

Empowerment Great leaders can empower their team members to achieve maximum productivity and organizational success. Empowerment gives the team members equal decision-making opportunities and uses their power of judgment and expertise to develop solutions. This builds the sense of individual worth and also employees' commitment towards their organization. Every individual brings their skills and talents to the table that often finds a route to flow. Usually, you would have skillful team members, but lack of guidance and motivation fails to bring them the best. It is, therefore, on leaders how they foster these skills by empowering them. Good leaders know how to unleash positive traits in others. They understand that the only way to do that is by empowering them. Therefore, leaders take it as a daily practice to continuously empower people and strengthen the team.

India and USA are vastly different in terms of corruption and law and order scenario primarily as the people in both the countries got empowered differently right from the start, i.e. post independence of each nation. In India, it was always the government first and then the people, while in USA and other western nations, it has always been the people first. In India, availability and spread of information, which many argue is the very basis of democracy, was always controlled tightly. As a result people in India remained marginalized and in grip of the government and the state, at least up until the late 1980s. Post Independence Era, Peace and International environment -: A bit surprised that no one brought up this point. The post independence era for both countries was different in both its nature and international scenarios prevalent at the time. The two critical factors that made a a difference to both nations post their respective independence, though separated by 180 years, were ‘Peace’ and ‘International environment’. Through the late 1700s to the early 1800s, the period after American independence was the prime period for growth of early industrialization, and by an extension, the growth of Industry and capitalism. American entrepreneurs were at an enviable position with the newly found independence, advance of railroad to connect vast stretches of country, and industrial revolution. Despite a short depression during 1784-85, the period of the 1780s was marked with a large growth of the economy. In contrast, the period of 2 - 3 decades immediately following the Indian independence was marked by a bloody partition, loss of many hundred thousand of lives, trouble with various states acceding to be with India, constant wars with Pakistan and China and internal strife. Add to it were the economic pressures and the ever looming threat of bankruptcy of the government due to huge loans. While America of the early days largely had its borders secure, meaning that they could spend their energy on growth and industrialism, India was under a constant threat of having its borders run over by wily Chinese or the untrustworthy Pakistanis, or perhaps both at the same time, meaning that there was never time to focus on growth, at least substantially for it to make a real difference, during the first 2 - 3 decades post independence. Hence the two countries got vastly different environment post their independence, as a result of which while America took the highway to growth, India is still trying to cross the country roads to make it to the Highway. The difference meant that while America focused on growth post independence, India was busy with internal strife and cross border threats.Communism and Socialism influence -: To start with, Socialism was the base of Indian independence movement as it espoused the causes of India's farmers and laborers against the landlords, princely class and landed gentry. Small socialist revolutionary groups arose in India in the aftermath of the October Revolution in Russia. The Communist Party of India was established in 1921, but socialism as an ideology gained a nationwide appeal after it was endorsed by nationalist leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. Radical socialists were among the first to call for outright Indian independence from Britain. Under Nehru, the Indian National Congress, India's largest political party, adopted socialism as an ideology for socio-economic policies in 1936. was most of the Indian leadership had a strong social - communist frame of mind. Capitalism and profit making were reviled virtues, in fact they were hardly seen as virtues at all. The large sections of society had very little choice but to follow the leaders, hence could never dram about capitalist way of doing business and private enterprise. Both Socialism and Communism meant strong state presence in every aspect of life, and state control of assets. There were very few private jobs owing to very few private enterprises and the only jobs that mattered were government jobs. These notions made the government ever more powerful and the ways of the government servants were never questioned, forget about being examined, criticized and possibly litigated against. This made the middle and senior level officers in any department, ministry or office of the Central or the state governments, pseudo Kings with virtually limitless power, with their writ becoming law despite courts and police being there to uphold the real law. Much of this was obviously due to lack of knowledge among common people. This meant that the government servants at all levels, all departments and all offices could get away with anything while indulging in acts of corruption openly. The corruption then became a way of life, for the perpetrators and victims alike. People never got to see anything else, hence never knew the difference.Licence raaj and the role of state -: The growth of industry and private enterprise was almost non existent or limited to the State or state appointed people / companies. This meant that the elite few cornered every industry and every enterprise, giving rise to corruption and favoritism. Being a businessman meant that you are related to someone in the government and it was commonly accepted that nothing could ever move without bribery. Given the umbrella cover government had on the industry, bribery became a necessary precursor to launch and conduct of any business.Lack of laws -: Government servants, businesses and generally anyone in power had the right to exploit common masses. Consumer protection laws, and other laws for empowerment of people were unheard of. Even where the laws existed, people seldom dared to question the erring parties. It was understood and accepted that common man is born to tolerate and withstand whatever comes his way, that courts and police can ruin lives, and that anyone in authority holds sway over your life if you are a commoner. This obviously meant that corrupt practices, crimes due to lack of law and order and the fact that high and mighty never get punished became ingrained in daily life.Middle class -: The American middle class has come up, declined and come up again, while in India’s case the post 90′s era saw for the first time the real growth of the Indian middle class. By definition, the middle class is the service / profession oriented middle income group which drives the nation forward. The opening up of Indian economy meant that private jobs came in to the picture. These private enterprises and employment opportunities meant that more people got employment which brought newer opportunities. This in turn fueled the rise of Higher and better education, availability of information, stronger laws, RTI, judicial activism, etc. The real reforms have just started in case of India. The belief that corruption is a way of life and people should tolerate and never complain were deep rooted beliefs, and perhaps many of us have experienced those and grown up in such environment. Of course, its all a distant memory now, especially the law and order part, but every now and then, something happens that is enough to remind you that the past is very much alive. As for corruption, I believe its not going away anytime soon."},{"instruction":"What does Galatians 2:21 mean?","output":"21 I do not reject the undeserved kindness of God, for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing.

He was a destroyer and cruiser sailor who was promoted to the position purely out of seniority. He never flew if he could avoid it and never flew off one of his carriers. I did read some things though about the Japanese Admiralty adn they copied the Royal Navy system to the tee in the late 1800’s including the ranks and standards for promotion. Victorian RN promoted mostly on seniority at the time because there were no wars to differentiate the admirals. It appears the Japanese copied that but never adjusted when the RN dumped many deadwood officers during Fischer’s reforms. There is a lot of evidence Yamamoto wanted to remove Nagumo after Pearl for failing to follow through with the attacks on the dockyards and facilities such as the oil tanks. But he could not. It is also interesting that Nagumo on a number of occasions violated fleet orders and doctrine and was not hurt by it. At Pearl, he sent the fleet tankers to the west after topping off to a position that dictated he not launch a third wave of scout the area for the American Carriers. The plan had been to to keep the tankers close enough to let the fleet stay for more than a few hours off Pearl. After the first wave hit Pearl Harbor, he failed to order the escorting cruisers to launch search planes in a normal wartime pattern around the fleet. They would have in all likelihood have spotted Lexington returning to Pearl from Midway. Nagumo also failed to pursue the RN fleet off Ceylon setting for sinking the old Hermes and two cruisers. At Midway, Nagumo vacillated about the second wave on Midway and clung to the idea that the Americans were asleep. He failed to understand that his confusion lead to massive amounts of ordinance stacked inhanger decks waiting to be set off. The Japanese air doctrine was to withdraw out of American range until the strike force was ready and then take advantage of their superior attack range. IF he had followed the doctrine, he would have withdrawn to the NW the way he came until he recovered the Midway strike force and was prepared to engage the US carriers in battle. Instead, he first dithered and then set a course to close with the Americans as if his fleet were a cruiser force. Worse, he was already in range and it was clear the Americans were trying to ambush him. His response cost the IJN 4 carriers and the battle. If they had withdrawn, the American dive bombers would have been forced to return to the carriers for fuel. The result would have been a straight up carrier duel like Coral Sea with 4 against 3 carriers with time for the carriers used in the Aleutians and escorting the main body to be brought up. And it is interesting that Nagumo survived while Admiral Yamaguchi went down with Hiryu. His death was particularly serious since he was in fact their best carrier admiral."},{"instruction":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","output":"Cryptocurrency is extremely volatile, so it depends on your goals.

In fact, microwave cooking can be a healthy way to prepare food, as it can help retain more nutrients compared to other cooking methods like boiling or frying, which can result in nutrient loss. Microwave ovens work by using electromagnetic radiation to heat up food. This radiation does not make food radioactive or create any harmful substances in the food. In fact, microwaves cook food by exciting water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate and generate heat. The food is heated evenly and quickly, reducing cooking time and preserving the natural color, flavor, and texture of the food. However, there are some precautions you can take when cooking food in a microwave oven to ensure that it is safe to consume: Use microwave-safe containers: Use only containers that are labeled as microwave-safe to prevent any harmful chemicals from leaching into the food.Stir or rotate food: To ensure even cooking and avoid hot spots, stir or rotate food during cooking.Avoid using plastic wrap: Plastic wrap can melt in the microwave and release harmful chemicals into the food. Instead, use a microwave-safe lid or a microwave-safe cover.Let food cool: Allow food to cool for a few minutes after cooking before consuming it, as microwaved food can be very hot and can cause burns. In summary, microwave cooking is safe and can be a healthy way to prepare food, as long as you take the necessary precautions and follow the manufacturer's instructions."},{"instruction":"w do I view saved videos from Facebook?","output":"In the left corner of the facebook page, You will see an option called “EXPLORE”.

Which are all the concepts of परमेश्वर श्री वज्रबाहु इंद्र. You could say names of indra in a oversimplified way. Someone who understand only a little bit of sanskrit can easily UNDERSTAND all of these things just by only looking at rig ved hyms randomy for only 30 mins.

Praise ONLY (READ IT AGAIN) ONLY mighty Indra when the juice is shed, and say your lauds repeatedly: How much will you ignore the fact that Indra occupies more than a quarter of the chāndasa sūktas while the trinity characters don’t even get their mentions in Vedas? How much will you ignore the fact that Indra was worshiped from Turkey to Tamil Nadu, take a look at Suppiluliuma (Hittite) -Shattiwaza (Mitanni) Treaty Rev 35-53: ancinet Turkey which mantions indra. -the Storm-god, Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Moon-god and the Sun-god, the Moon-god of Harran, heaven and earth, the Storm-god, Lord of the kurinnu of Kahat, the Deity of Herds of Kurta, the Storm-god, Lord of Uhušuman, Ea-šarri, Lord of Wisdom, Anu, Antu, Enlil, Ninlil, the Mitra-gods, the Varuna-gods, Indra, the Nasatya-gods, Lord of Waššukanni, the Storm-god, Lord of the Temple Platform (?) of Irrite, Partahi of Šuta, Nabarbi, Šuruhi, Ištar, Evening Star, Šala, Belet-ekalli, Damkina, Išhara, the mountains and rivers, the deities of heaven and the deities of earth. his cognates everywhere from Europe to South East Asia, but not any of the characters in Trinity? How much will you ignore the fact that chāndasa verses used in yajñas (according to the mīmāṃsakas, the “śreṣṭhatama karma” or “best karma”) are in full praise of Indra’s solitary and collective Vedic divine power? You will find Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni and Nāsatyas everywhere in the Indo European lands, and cognates even in non-IE cultures of ancient world, like for example Al-Maqah in Arabia. Take a look at kirson Krishnan's ANSWER to Why is Indra shown as a womanizer in Hindu epics other than the Vedas? Because Indra is the name of ultimate Divine concept in the oldest Vedas. As the later scriptures were in a state of cult based sectarianism, or in a state of politicized dogmatic polytheism, they wanted to popularize their myths and mythical characters, which they thought to be “different” from Divine concepts in Vedas. (For dogmatic polytheists, unlike henotheists, never know of any unity in divine expression) For this, they hunted down, or censored the Vedic divinities one by one. Mitra, Aśvins, Aryaman, Bhaga, Pūṣan, Savitar etc. were censored. Several others like Sarasvatī, Rudra, Viṣṇu, were equated to something else. Agni, Parjanya, Vāyu, etc. became mere nature gods. Even the mighty Varuṇa was reduced to being lord of waters. And Indra just as an over proud king (perhaps modeling the reality of stupid kings of their times) of this class of “gods”. But Indra couldn’t be censored, for he is puruhūta in Vedas and Brahmanic religion. People would still worship him, as he was worshiped as a god even in Tamil Nadu, during the annual indra vizha. A Krishna tried his best during medieval ages in North India, to stop it. And Puranas tried their best to promote their sectarian gods to belittle “Indra”, whom they saw as a rival god of olden times. Fake legends were written, as is the norm of these works, on Indra, so that people won’t ever think of Indra. Also, Vedas were more and more censored. Vedic Brahmanism was ridiculed. The Shiva’s chihnas (symbols) are the serpent in neck, Ganga from head, the trident (tri-shUla), drum (damaru) in it, tiger skin, blue neck, crematory ash remains (shava bhasmam), three eyes, and Shakti being his half. Show me any one mantra, any one mantra in Rigveda that talks about such a Kailasa living, Nandi riding being having all these symbols, called Shiva. (Before you talk about triyambak see this- Before understanding the meaning of “Tryambaka” त्र्यम्बक, let us consider the following Rica रिचा, श्लोक (incidentally one of the most powerful mantra-s) from the RgVeda: RV 2.41.16 (to Devi Saraswati) अम्बि॑ऽतमे । नदी॑ऽतमे । देवि॑ऽतमे । सर॑स्वति । अ॒प्र॒श॒स्ताःऽइ॑व । स्म॒सि॒ । प्रऽश॑स्तिम् । अ॒म्ब॒ । नः॒ । कृ॒धि॒ ॥ ambitame nadītame devitame sarasvati | apraśastā iva smasi praśastim amba nas kṛdhi || Translation: “Among all mothers (ambi-s), among all rivers, among all Devis, O Saraswati, thou are the best! O mother (amba), make us – the ignoble- full of renown.” Here, both ambi अम्बि and amba अम्ब have been used to mean “mother”. So, amba means: mother -common noun- not Mother, but mother; and much more than that: “womb” can be seen as coming from amba. It also denotes the “waters” realm of Mother (Antariksha; Space). That’s where ambā (“watery”/ “spacious”) comes from, as well as ambikā (ambi+kā; fem.). Hence, ambuja (ambu+ja) means: “water-born”; ambar (amba+ra) means: antariksha, ākāsha. And that’s why ambak (amba+ka; masc.) means: “of mother”. This is the only meaning Veda knows of, verily, as in this exquisite Rica (the famed Mahāmrityunjaya Mantra) for Rudra. RV 7.59.12: त्र्य॑म्बकम् । य॒जा॒म॒हे॒ । सु॒गन्धि॑म् । पु॒ष्टि॒ऽवर्ध॑नम् । उ॒र्वा॒रु॒कम्ऽइ॑व । बन्ध॑नात् । मृ॒त्योः । मु॒क्षी॒य॒ । मा । अ॒मृता॑त् ॥ tryambakam | yajāmahe | sugandhim | puṣṭi-vardhanam | urvārukam-iva | bandhanāt | mṛtyoḥ | mukṣīya | mā | amṛtāt Translation: “I worship thee, the Three-mothered (Tryambaka), of pleasant odour, the giver of good health. Liberate me unto Immortality even as the gourd fruit is freed of its shell (i.e., when death comes).” So, त्र्यम्बक = त्रि + अम्बक, Tryambaka = tri (three) + ambaka (of mother) This realisation has been lost on the people since the end of the Vedic age, and upon much speculation and groping in the dark, Tryambaka was arbitrarily assigned the meaning: Three eyed. That even while Trilochana त्रिलोचन already means “three eyed” and is used very widely as an attribute of Shiva/ Rudra. However Eye” (लोचन, चक्षु, नयन, etc.) is a utility word and therefore ambaka if meaning “eye” should have usage in regular contexts. This also doesn’t seem to be the case. However, in a classical text on Ayurveda, Ashtānga Hridayam, a word “valāmbaka”(vala+ambaka) वलाम्बकः occurs, and is said to be the place where the “remaining disease (phlegm)” is confined. Now, both Vala and ambaka are Rgvedic words. Vala is the Asat of Antariksha (Mother’s) realm who holds up Her waters, that is, is a barrier between us and Mother. The disease, in question, is being sent to this mysterious place, outside the body to “above it”, via the sahasradhara chakra, presumably. “valāmbaka” (Mother’s hold/ cave) is that place where this is sent and held up. This is how healing and self-healing is performed by Yogis. So here again, ambaka means “of mother” and not “eye” as translated by some.) Same thing with vishnu In sanskrit the the meaning of the word विष्णु is Preserver. Vedic divine concept of Vishnu is one of the minor ones of indra. He represents just the brilliance of sunlight in sky, who rises through three realms of land, atmosphere and sky, to reach the highest summit of sky. (brahman) As such, he is the companion and tool-force of Indra concept You could say name of indra in a oversimplified way. Same thing with brahma In sanskrit the the meaning of the word ब्राह्म is creator. HERE IS THE SOLID PROOF THAT VISHNU and BHARAMA are JUST. NAMEs OF INDRA Rig veda 2.1.3 READ CAREFULLY तवमग्न इन्द्रो वर्षभः सतामसि तवं विष्णुरुरुगायो नमस्यः | तवं बरह्मा रयिविद बरह्मणस पते तवं विधर्तःसचसे पुरन्ध्या || tvamaghna indro vṛṣabhaḥ satāmasi tvaṃ viṣṇururughāyo namasyaḥ | tvaṃ brahmā rayivid brahmaṇas pate tvaṃ vidhartaḥsacase purandhyā || Hero of Heroes, Agni! Thou art Indra, thou art Viṣṇu of the Mighty Stride, adorable: Thou, Brahmaṇaspati, the Brahman finding wealth: thou, O Sustainer, with thy wisdom tendest us. Rudra has four independent hymns in total, in Rigveda. (Vishnu has four independent hymns, Indra has around 250) There is no Trimurti. Nothing of that kind. And the mention of Vishnu and Rudra is so feeble, and come only as another set of names for \\"God\\" The INDRA, not as individual \\"gods\\". \\"Vishnu\\" is the concept of Indra You could say names of indra in a oversimplified way as \\"cause and supporter of the world\\" by \\"filling out the three regions with his sweetness\\", \\"a most courageous act\\". \\"Rudra\\" is the one \\"who makes weep\\", another concept of indra as Lord of \\"death (on the contrary, life), auspiciousness (on the contrary mishaps)....) That's all. No Shiva pouring out Ganga from his head, carrying trident, carrying moon, wearing serpent garland, damaru playing, Nandi vehicle, ganesh - subrahmanya as sons, parvati as wife, kailasa as abode.............. all are hindu myths not attested in Vedas. No Brahma handling four Vedas, having Sarasvati as wife, seated in lotus, bearded old man, four (five??) heads, born out of Vishnu's navel.... again full myths. And most importantly no Vishnu , with all \\"Vishnu cihnas\\" like conch, discus...., blue (or grey) in colour, having Lakshmi as wife EVERYTHING IS A MYTH. Not attested in Vedas....... reclining in serpent bed, living in milky ocean, abode in Vaikuntha (Vaikuntha is a name for Indra!!), avatars, govinda (govinda is a title of Vedic Indra, because as we have seen, he finds the \\"cows\\" of knowledge \\"from the caves of darkness\\"... all such titles have a long Indra story..) (lakshmi is another name for indra. YES you heard it right. Lakshmi is the name of indra. There are three grammatical genders: masculine (पुंलिङ्ग puṃliṅga), feminine (स्त्रीलिङ्ग strīliṅga), and neuter (नपुंसकलिङ्ग napuṃsakaliṅga) Indra is formless. Therefore he is not male neither female nor neuter So there are names of him in all 3 grammatical genders of sanskrit) there is no gender for any of devas, only that they have masculine or feminine or sometimes neutral names. Indra whom we reduce in our mind to a concept, is never the Reality as such. That said, Vedas don’t speak of “wives” or “husbands” or “sons” of devas apart from poetic attributions. Wives of devas are for example, the verses gifted to them by sage. Husbands of verses (because the verses are conceptualized feminine) are the devas when they receive them from poet, and the poet himself when he receives from them. Agni is our father, as we are born from Agni. Indra “rules” everything because we conceptualize the “rule”. śacī is the power, of the same root as śakti. Śacī is not the wife of an anthropomorphized Indra, at least in Vedas. Śacī on the other hand, is the name of a Vedic poetess queen, who speaks of herself poetically as the power, who is the queen over everywhere in the universe. She is a sage, or a name taken by a poetess sage, in Rigveda. Indra and other devas are not even conceptualized in masculine names which could be thought of as humans, but also more frequently, as bulls, horses, “good milch cows”, etc. Conceptual forms like tad ekam, or prathamo jātaḥ, or hiraṇyagarbha, or skambha etc. also apply to Vedic Indra. There is no gender or gender role, to Indra or any other devas unless we imagine one for them in their concept. Their concepts are highly malleable. For example, Indra is called famously the daughter (or wife?) of Vṛṣaṇaśva. (Vṛṣaṇaśvasya mene) Unlike strictly anthropomorhic gods, Indra doesn’t “take the human form of a wife or daughter” of someone. In later legends, this “ambivalence” in the gender in human concepts turned to mocking Indra the “god” as impotent, and having lost his potency due to some act committed by him. Rāmāyaṇa twists the actual yajus which calls Indra “medhātither meṣa, vṛṣaṇaśvasya mene” (Oh ram of medhātithi, oh daughter of Vṛṣaṇaśva) to create a false word in between, meṣavṛṣaṇa, which means “(of) ram testicle”, and furnishes the Ahalya myth in this context. The notion of “relationships” among divine concepts is also confined to poetry of Vedas. They make no sense otherwise. For example, the poet creates the verse, but he is also the “husband” of the verse he creates in mind, inspired from divinity. This was incomprehensible outside the poetry, to the masses. Thus, Brahmā (which is an epithet to the poet in Vedas) was mocked for incestuous relationship with his mind born daughter in later day Puranas, ultimately asking people to stop “worshiping” him. And you know, where the ownership of Vedas were attributed in the Puranic ages, to. The Dyaus, which is the spiritual expanse, the house of insight, both vivifies (thus becomes the father) and also is complementary to the mundane mind of poet. (prithivī, “earth”) The sage is born from this. This is what Dīrghatamas the sage explains coolly in the verses of Rigveda 1.164. With a mind wanting to anthropomorphize or detaching them from their poetic concepts, we will find “incest”. But in the poetry of Vedas, we are made to transcend the notions of ourselves. Only then will Vedas make sense. Also, there is no “first creator” or gender for “first creator”. Aditi is born from Dakṣa, and Dakṣa is born from Aditi. Puruṣa is born from Virāj, and Virāj from Puruṣa. Devas are born from soma and soma is gifted from devas. Everything has end or beginning or form or attributes only in our mind. It seems concept of Divine can be said only in metaphores. It seems attempt to technically describe Absolute Reality is bewildering and creates various interpretations. Major problem is then if someone takes metaphores literally and interprets them in technical way. that's exactly the power of poetry, and that's why sages were poets. (kavis). And they consciously glorify poetry and verses - for those verses have been more or less successful in doing what humans otherwise cannot using any tool. Because poetry is an art which hides depth of thoughts, showing only a layer outside. What else can attempt to describe the reality other than poetry? Rigvedic philosophy is entirely different from hindu or you could say puranic philosophy and concepts of God hindu philosophy is a sectarian henotheism, that has polytheism (बहुदेववाद) in its base. The Rigvedic philosophy is however pure panentheism with monotheistic (एकेश्वरवाद) monism as base. Rigveda talks about the single One Reality (ekam sad / tad ekam) that is poetically named “who”. (kaH) This is because when we tell of “who”, it actually refers to someone who we know by presence (due to some deed), but not the details. For a seeker, this reality “who” is the God, so that “who” is the God whom we worship with offerings. (RV. 10.121, “Hiranyagarbha sukta”) The “who” for a seeker, is thus the Reality that covers itself by the bright lustre. Thus, it is poetically equated to the “spiritual sun”, where the Reality is behind the maya of the blinding rays. As a result, the God or the Reality is called the “source of golden lustre” or hiranya-garbha. And the poets pray to see the Truth “beyond the (mesmerizing) sun”. (This “seeing of sun” and association of sun with spiritual vision is a common theme in Rigveda, and thus also in Yajurveda) Thus, this “sun” also represents the net of concepts of God that we can visualize through our spiritual vision, and its rays are the different concepts of God. Thus, the concepts of God “vivify” the different quarters of earth, our physical mind. Thus, this Sun, the abode of all supreme concepts is called Indra, the “vivifier”. This Indra is the Rigvedic concept of God that has in it the abode of all other concepts of God. (RV 3.54) The Vishnu is a different concept in Vedas. The Vishnu is the all pervading illuminence of this “Sun” Indra. This Vishnu “measures out” the three realms (dyaus, pRthivi, antariksha) or even the seven realms of spiritual plane and asists Indra in shaping the spiritual world. In Rigveda, Indra creates the spiritual world, and Vishnu is the radiance who is the “friend” of Indra, who “helps” Indra You could say he is another name for of indra in a oversimplified way Viṣṇu in Vedas (here, Rigveda) is the symbol of pervading light, just as a sun rising to heaven and illuminating everywhere. Thus, he is the companion who is enabled by Indra as he destroys the blockage Vṛtra, causing Viṣṇu to stride forth and spread the brilliance of light everywhere. Viṣṇu is this concept in Vedas, and therefore could also symbolize the “all encompassing Yajña” or “Yajñapuruṣa” from the later Vedic age. He has the power of Agni (agni is another name for indra) while spreading, and has the encompassing power being an Āditya. Indra has all the qualities that are found in other concepts of God. In Indra “abide” all the concepts of God. Indra is the one whose splendour pervades throughout the universe. He through the maya, assumes different forms; he verily attacks the illusory elements with their own illusion. He finds the rays of light (cows) from the darkness of ignorance (Vala’s cave), he is against unproductive Capitalism - he frees the cows from Panis who steal and hide them, he attacks the rain cloud Vrtra / Varaha with his lightning and brings rain of knowledge that connects the spiritual mind (sky) and physical mind (earth), he quietens Shushna (the shrinker; one who causes to shrink) with his (Shushna’s) own illusion, and provides wide earth (physical mind). He lets the unwedded maidens of fountains to gush from the mountains. Thus he releases the “cows” (of water streams) from mountains. Indra is also the model for any Brahmana, any King, any Vaishya as well as any Shudra. As the sagest of all sages, the poet among all poets, he is the model for a Brahmin. As the protector of Rta (eternal Truth, law and order, cognate with English “order”, “right”) he is the model of a King. As the friend of all and connecting the world with his chariot that isvishva-sammishla (universally mingling), he is the model for the common man Vaishya. As the never failing Help, never failing aid provider, Indra is the model for Shudra. Indra, moreover, clothes the naked and makes blind see. He uplifts the oppressed and thus is the model for any human. As the vivifier through the life essence of his rains that connect the spiritual mind and physical mind, we see soma in Indra. As he himself also is the richest in rays of cows of knowledge (Gautama; refer Sub. litany, Taittiriya / Maitrayani Samhita Yajurveda) as well as sows the seed by ploughing the infertile and unploughable (a-halya; halya = that which can be ploughed) earth of physical mind, (for this reason he is also called Kaushika, kushika means plowshare; ref : Sub. Litany) we see Savitr, the “sowing sun”, and Surya in him. He is the friend of all, he himself sees through Mitra’s eyes. As the ruler of the universe omnipresent, he is Varuna himself. As the killer of hurdles and blockers, “serpents” (or “dragons”, referring to creeping dangers) and darkness, Indra is Agni himself. He creates the world and assumes the role of Tvashtr. He is himself the spiritual Sun; the Vedic symbol of Self and container of Reality, and His radiance is the all illuminating Vishnu, who measures all realms created by Indra. He the provider of riches, is simply the Lakshmi form of Agni. As infinite forms, he himself is Aditi. As the giver of knowledge and sage of sages, Indra is the Brhaspati, he is the Vrshabha in might, he is the splendour that pervades the whole universe. (pashya meha… “See me here” the famous telling of Indra to an agnostic) There is Indra implies that all the concepts of God are there; however, there is no Indra means that there is no God. This is why in Rigveda, we find atheists denying simply Indra directly; because Indra has no single physical symbol - all the symbols form a part of Him. And we find in Rigvedic Indra the God beyond gender, creed, race, form, physical concepts. Though Indra in Rigveda can also be taken, like any other Rigvedic concept of God, as a single concept that is identical with other concepts about the Supreme God, the Rigvedic Indra is conceptually much more. The Indra of Rigveda is the concept of God that contains in itself all other concepts of God.

Reading the Bible in context… The answer to your problem is actually quite easy. Simply prove it from the Bible and show how it is backed up by archaeological evidence. Although it may appear, through a surface level reading of an English translation, that the Genesis flood narrative recounts a global flood, this is most likely taken out of context, not to mention extrapolated by the corrupt Church leaders in order to lead the masses astray. It is important to note that in Hebrew the phrase כָּל־אֶ֣רֶץ (kâl-ʾereṣ) does not necessarily infer that the entire world was actually covered. In fact, Genesis 17:8 the same phrase is used to refer to Canaan. The phrase begins with “all,” reflecting the original Hebrew כֹּל (kôl), meaning “all, every.” The word ארץ, as in הָאָרֶץ‎‎ (hâʾâreṣ, “the earth”) can be translated as 'earth', as in our planet, but it can simply refer to a large geographical region. So there is no specific indication of an actual global flood.

Nowhere in the Tanakh is it ever explicitly said that the flood actually covered the whole earth, in fact, when read in context it implies quite the opposite: There is an assertion among a number of historians and archaeologists that a great flood devastated a region of Mesopotamia at the dawn of history—probably flooding over the fertile crescent—and that this event was the origin of the biblical Flood narrative. However, I think it quite compelling that a Mesopotamian flood didn't inspire the Bible, but rather that Noah's flood is the devastating flood which took place in the cradle of civilization. The story of a huge cataclysmic flood that wiped out a huge swath of the early human population is found in all cultures across the globe. Can it be that such takes are just myths?

The famous and glamorous Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, after his deep excavations of the Early Dynastic royal tombs at Ur, had a small test shaft sunk into the underlying soil. He persisted through some eight feet of bare mud before finally coming to a layer bearing artifacts of late prehistoric date. It did not take Woolley long to arrive at an interpretation: …by the time I had written up my notes was quite convinced of what it all meant; but I wanted to see whether others would come to the same conclusion. So I brought up two of my staff and, after pointing out the facts, asked for their explanation. They did not know what to say.

This megaflood occurred across the Mediterranean Sea, an in-pouring of water so huge that it excavated a canyon five kilometres deep and 20 kilometres long, and created a waterfall with a 1.5 kilometre drop. Evidence for the great flood, long hypothesised, has now been found by a team of researchers led by geoscientist Aaron Micallef from the University of Malta. And while several Mediterranean traditions feature great flood narratives, the earliest arising from Sumeria and already well enough known to be recorded in cuneiform by the seventeenth century BCE, this one is unlikely to have been the inspiration. In a paper published in the journal[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19446-3][LINKED_TEXT: Scientific Reports] [URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19446-3], Micallef and colleagues present geological evidence for an event known as the Zanclean megaflood, which took place around 5,300,000 years ago. The flood was preceded by a catastrophic geologic transformation called the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC), described by the researchers as “the most abrupt, global-scale environmental change since the end of the Cretaceous”. In the Mediterranean region, the crisis was caused by the closure of what today is known as the strait of Gibraltar, cutting the passage between the sea and the Atlantic Ocean. This occurred around six million years ago.{%recommended 5971%}. As a result, there was a drastic imbalance created between evaporation rates and replenishing water intake. The Med transformed into two giant hypersaline lakes, separated by a land-bridge running from the toe of Italy, incorporating Sicily and ending at north Africa. Sea levels are estimated to have dropped by between 1300 and 2400 metres. Salt deposits a kilometre thick settled on the sea floor. Geographic evidence gathered in the 1970s led to the formation of the Zanclean megaflood hypothesis. Conclusive evidence, however, was lacking, leading some researchers to suggest the MSC was ended by a flow of brackish water from the Black Sea, with Atlantic inflow resuming only later. In the latest research, using seafloor data from offshore eastern Sicily and the islands of Malta, Micallef’s team identifies a distinct body of sediment 160 kilometres long and 95 kilometres wide that lies on top of the saline deposits, ending abruptly against an undersea limestone cliff called the Malta Escarpment off eastern Sicily, and thinning down in a wedge-shape to the east. The wedge is 900 metres deep in places. The researchers suggest it represents debris and sediment pushed eastwards by a surge of water coming in from the Atlantic upon the reopening of the Gibraltar strait. The mass of water, carrying the debris, crested the land-bridge and plunged down the other side creating a five-kilometre-deep trench, still around today and known as the Noto canyon. It also careened down the Malta escarpment, dropping 1.5 kilometres. Micallef and colleagues conclude that the evidence suggests the megaflood was a Mediterranean-wide event, rather than one restricted to its eastern reaches, as the Black Sea theory holds. So powerful was the flood, it is estimated that the Med reversed water loses incurred over 640,000 years in just two. So I think it's possible that something similar could have taken place in pre-biblical times, possibly roughly around 4,000 years ago. This megaflood would have sweep across the near east, wiping out an entire civilization of early humans, and leaving only Noah and his family. The Black Sea deluge theory Results from a July 2005 cruise in the Black Sea may settle a longstanding debate over evidence of a megaflood in the Black Sea, the so-called “Noah’s Flood.” Multibeam bathymetry and sub-bottom profiling reveals ridges, some more than 12 meters (40 feet) high, and channels formed by erosion of the seafloor. The channels and ridges organize into a unique landform – a shelf fan, probably constructed by the flood. Mud drifts are associated with many ridges on the shelf, a phenomenon previously described only in the deep sea. At about 9,000 years ago, the Black Sea was a lake with a level lower than the ocean. The catastrophic flood of saltwater from the Mediterranean Sea led to a dramatic reorganization of the shelf seafloor close to the Bosporus and favored an exceptional preservation of shorelines and coastal bedforms elsewhere along the Black Sea shelf Also, please check out the following: [LINKED_TEXT: Ancient Chinese Megaflood May Be Fact, Not Fiction] [URL: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ancient-chinese-megaflood-may-be-fact-not-fiction/][LINKED_TEXT: The Truth About Genesis] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsYCe6PgQNj0nYYSxeAzHuDflxRQ_V69t][LINKED_TEXT: Piercing The Heart of Theism] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsYCe6PgQNj2-qDd14Chbx1S1UKO2g3kM][LINKED_TEXT: Damien Cowl's answer to God: How can a loving God send people to hell?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/God-How-can-a-loving-God-send-people-to-hell/answer/Damien-Cowl?ch=10&share=b99ad524&srid=ur7z07] Model is based on a blueprint drawn up in ancient Babylon 4,000 years agoVessel is coracle-like and around a fifth of the size described on the tabletIt was constructed using traditional techniques and material in IndiaIrving Finkel of The British Museum said the scaled-down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘well behaved animals’He doubts the full-size version would have been sea worthyReplica developed leaks, but Dr Finkel said the Babylonian's design was not to blame, saying the ark could have 'floated to New York' given the chance"},{"instruction":"w do I dance the Tango?","output":"With PASSION and ABANDONMENT as if you were having vertical copulation!!!"},{"instruction":"What is the difference between melt and thaw?","output":"Thanks for the A2A: What is the difference between melt and thaw?

Major part of problem solving is Intuition, when we begin, we lack any intuition, because it comes with practice and knowledge, so, without knowing anything your brain is unable to explore various ideas, and you only get to know these ideas by solving similar problems or atleast knowing how it's solved. This is a deadlock, you can't solve without practice and you can't practice without solving, so, starting with easy problems is the only way, and reading and understanding and implementing solution is the way you learn something from every problem even if you couldn't solve it yourself. Once your intuition starts developing you're able to solve easier problems, your rating increases if you take part in contest, and so does difficulty of problems that you need to solve. To make sure you make best use of contests, it's important to solve problems that are hard for you, by reading the editorial, and implementing yourself, you'll learn something that can be useful in future. Even following these tips would take long time, and you can lose motivation midway as it's mundane to keep solving problems all day, you need to have someone who is as interested as you're and discusses problems with you. Either it's one of your friends or someone online or a community of people doing CP, You'll grow much faster by having like-minded people around you, people who are better than you will always teach you something useful. So, that's how you get started, solve lot of problems, from various platforms, get out of comfort zone and be around like-minded people, CP won't feel boring then and once you start growing, you'll get addicted to problem solving which is what the end goal is."},{"instruction":"Are NRA members proud that legally owned guns are used in school mass shootings?","output":"As “proud”, probably, as YOU that emotionally disturbed transgender killers have been involved.

It means she wants to survive and wants her family to survive. The baby is much more likely to kill the mother, than the mother kill the baby. The pro-life movement was designed as a wedge issue and cash cow for the Republican party and ‘religious’ right. THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF BANNING ABORTION. Just ask bishop Timlin and Cardinal Law. When the Republicans were in power, they did NOTHING to really limit access to abortion. They knew they would be immediately voted out of office and were not that stupid. It would have also cut off the money stream. God himself/herself ASKED MARY’S PERMISSIONS BEFORE IMPREGNATING HER. ALL MEN SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE AND ASK FIRST.

In all of the ‘Pro-Life’ stories about the babies ‘rescued’, I have never heard of anyone ASKING THE MOTHER IF SHE WAS SAFE. The number of unborn children who die because of violence against the mother are approximately equal to the abortion rate. That doesn’t include the death rate to the women. They are apparently unimportant. Funny that I almost never hear a bit of concern about that from the ‘pro-lifers.’ Per the NIH, about 1/3 to ½ of fetal and maternal deaths are preventable through prenatal care. What is the current ‘administration’ and the Catholic Church working against – access to health care for women. The percentage of abortions performed because of medical reasons is about 20%. Doctor’s are not God. They cannot save everyone. Sometimes they have to choose which one they can save. The South American OB/GYN’s recently petitioned the Church to relax its antiabortion stance as they were sick of seeing the resultant carnage. “Cause of Fetal Death; Data from the Fetal Death Report, 2014”, National Vital Statistics Volume 65 Number 7 published October 31, 2016 by the CDC. Bureaus of Justice Statistics USDOJ. “Family Violence Statistics”, Cervical Cancer Vaccine I have been researching the demographics on abortion – some ‘fun’ facts –Most women who have abortions are older women stressed to the max caring for family members and literally having to decide who lives and who dies. The number of abortions is at a record low since Roe vs. Wade. The number of abortions in this country is 1 per 70 Catholics. Out of 70 Catholics no one is willing to help one desperate woman? The lady on the Women’s Rally bus agreed. She had a friend considering an abortion because she was overwhelmed. She went to all the churches in town and could find only two people who were willing to help her.

Now imagine that high 100x’s weaker. That’s what some types of kratom feel like. The feeling is vaguely familiar, but still not in the same ballpark. The painkilling properties are just as good as any opioid I’ve taken. And with a clear head, you can actually think straight and get some work done. Not flake out. You won’t have any desire to keep upping the dose once you realise how kratom works. You get a little euphoria along with great pain relief. It also causes some severe constipation, which is one way kratom kinda forces you to take only so much at a time. Too much throughout the day will just make you sick. Opioids get you high, while kratom gets the job done, and may lift your mood."},{"instruction":"What is a list of skills that are amazing if you learn them?","output":"Selling - Master salespeople can sell anything from products to customers to ideas to their spouses. When you learn to sell you learn to get your ideas and points across, while also becoming an asset to every company in the world.Charisma - Learning to be charismatic is of huge benefit as it allows you to build connections faster and more effectively than others. Your network will expand and with that will your opportunities.Investing - Rich people do not get rich through their work, they get rich because they learned how to make their money work for them.Self-Reflection - Only when you can be truly objective and effective with yourself can you improve. Without knowing what is wrong or what you want, how do you know what path to follow?Active Listening - A skill practiced by every therapist that allows them to see behind the words the person speaks and instantly zone in what truly matters. This usually results in people wanting to talk to you more but also you gaining a higher sense of what is going on inside yourself.Body Control - You only need to learn to use your body once (such as through a sport) to have a huge advantage in learning to use it other ways. Knowing what your body can do, how to use it and what it’s limitations are is the first step to improving and maintaining it in the best way possible.Gratitude - Being grateful is a skill unlike any other. Once you learn how to be grateful the joy and appreciation you have for life will skyrocket, making most days fun, entertaining and a blessing rather than a chore.Speed Reading - Going through a page in but a few seconds allows you to devour information. Imagine being able to read a book every 30 minutes. What you could do with all that knowledge.Languages - Imagine being able to travel anywhere in the world while still being able to communicate with the people there. This will make traveling and meeting new people dozens of times more fun.Playing an Instrument - This is one of the most common regrets of people as they grow older, that they did not keep up with their instrument. Learn to play for others, but also for you as creativity is one of the best ways to take a break from the world.Internet - Just learning how to use Google and YouTube will open up a world of free courses, advice on anything imaginable and more valuable, life-changing content than you could ever hope to consume. The internet is a vast place. Learning to sift through this vastness effectively will benefit you for a lifetime.Scheduling Your Time - When you can effectively schedule your time you can effectively control your time. This means you get to spend the most time on what matters most to you, get to enjoy each and every day and feel very little to no regret about your days, weeks, months and years.Optimism - There is a certain finesse about learning to be optimistic. You must maintain a bit of realism but be positive and uplifting enough to test the limits of what is real. That way you push further than most."},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"I just encountered this problem and was about to cry that my books were gone when it worked. I was reading when I got the notification from kindle that my battery was low. They appeared over 4 times and I kept on ignoring them as I was busy reading. I then put it to sleep at 10% and charged it once I got home an hour later. After an hour or more of it charging nothing happened once I opened it. It showed me the dreadful warning sign with no reaction from the screen. The amber light on the bottom showed me it was charging though. I saw some answers saying I should plug it in my laptop, tried that, and failed. After it was plugged for a bit over an hour in my laptop, and an attempt with 45 seconds of reset with no hope on the horizon, it suddenly had the loading page and lit up (the one with the person sitting under a tree).

I'm just completely emotionally numb, except I only get angry and frustrated) 99% of anything I do I'm fine, I'm just trying to get to tomorrow. But every now and than, whenever I'm at home and only at home, I'll just burst into these 5–10 minute episodes of me getting pissed off at a game or something then moving onto something else thats been bothering me. My dad is a really good guy, and does his best to listen to me. And so are my mom and step dad too, and they all do a great job listening to me when im upset. But I do not have good memory, I'm somewhat certain, that since when i was really little i got lead poisoning, i think that contributed to my slight balance issues, ODD, and memory. but i jjst remember one day my mom and step dad decided to send me off to long term residential (the step below a juvy id call it) for about 4 months. they were long, and almost every day both my mom and step dad called me, this was before i moved to my dads house, and before my biological dad even knew what was going on, eventually he found out and started calling me which was nice. but i was just extremely conflicted, why did my family send me here if they care and i didnt do anything wrong? the staff all said it was because my parents didnt want me, and i didnt knkw what to feel.. but about the actual question, i think the worst thing ive seen is somebody else there with (im fairly certain schizophrenia..?) could give herself psuedo-siezures, and would cause them so that she could get things she wanted like extra food at lunch etc. a lot of times what was on our plates was all the food available (wtf? did they want us to starve?) so shed legit just walk up to whoever she felt nessicary and shriek at the top of her lungs grab the persons food and run off with it to her room. she also had access to her own tablet, and blankets, and about 50 pillows and stuff. we werent.. it was so hard trying to sleep listening to her screem bloody murder when PPAP stopped playing for an AD at 2am. I felt a lot of empathy for a while, but it got hard to when this happened every other day honestly.. What was weird about staying there for 4 months though, was now that 3–4 years have past, it didnt seem that bad.. i dont know why, but it really was, but for some reason a corner of my mind is trying to tell me it wasnt that horrible.. i still dont get it 😕"},{"instruction":"w did you find out about essay writing services?","output":"I found out By searching for relevant keywords or phrases like \\"essay writing service,\\" \\"custom essay writing,\\" or specific service providers.

Ofcourse after the devastating sudden demise of the late Sushant Singh Rajput. This was the only way we could watch him for the one last time on screen. I could have biased review or maybe not. My moto behind watching this movie wasn't in order to evaluate it or desect it. But to watch the actor one last time. Review: Picture: Google image. Manny is portrayed as a lively character. In fact, in most part of the movie we can't even make out that the hero was suffering from cancer and had a prosthetic leg. Kizzie the terminal cancer patient is also shown as a beautiful girl and she doesn't look like a patient at all. Cancer is never shown as it is, in the movies. Maybe just to give a visual affect to the overall movie and to add some life to the otherwise melancholic storyline. The on-screen chemistry is potrayed well. I have read the novel, 'The faults in the star' and already knew the storyline. But I am happy to watch it anyway because the movie 'Dil bechara' is very well Indianised. The characters don't try to imitate anyone and that's the best part of the movie. It doesn't seem like a novel adaptation or a remake of another movie. There are different elements added and it makes up a good movie.

For JEE Advanced, faculties were expecting the first friend to score a 2 digit rank but results were unexpected; the friend with 34k rank in JEE M got a rank around 5k and the first friend, from whom everybody was expecting, got a rank around 8k. Knowledge and preparation is important but your temperament in the examination hall is the deciding factor. You should know the art to deal with pressure. There will be situations when you will realise that you are completely undone, you have ruined the paper. Your heart starts thumping and a dizzy feeling starts coming to your mind but this is common for most of the serious aspirants giving the exam because paper is tough and unexpected. The ones who break through this, become the ones who conquer the exam. Few pieces of advice I want to give is- Know yourself well i.e your strengths and weaknesses for all 3 subjects, this improves your self confidence.Give mock tests and analyse your performance in every test this feels like a time waste because we don’t want to look at our mistakes and at the questions we could not solve again but it is not. It improves your performance.Be calm and confident during exam.

Rather than get caught up with all the hype in the media. You can use history, logic, or your best source of information. History shows Kim Il-sung died in 1994 about 2 days before it was announced. There was a lot of intrigue surrounding events & it is likely he was poisoned. Kim Jong-il died in 2011 of what appeared to be acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). He was in treatment for factors that could lead to a stroke also. But North Korea was caught be surprise (seemingly) with his death and it took a few more days to consolidate a power base for the new leader Kim Jong-un to take power. So we would assume to hear something from North Korea within a week of Kim Jong-un’s death. Probably more like 4 days. Using logic, what happened to most people around the world at the same time Kim started to fail to show up? That’s right . . . We all went into isolation because of COVID-19. So why do we assume Kim is very ill or is dead rather than in isolation with a few of his key people? You have got me on that one. I don’t know why so many are creating stories about why Kim can’t be found. It seems obvious to me. Next best source besides the North Koreans themselves will be the South Koreans. They have made a point of saying there is nothing unusual going on in North Korea. So why doesn’t the world & the press listen to them instead of making up these wild rumors they couldn’t possibly know about? They have to be vague to protect sources that gather intelligence. You can imagine if they said Kim attended a movie (he’s a movie buff) at a theater on his resort yesterday for example. North Korean only has to gather the people that would have known about that & execute them all. But that doesn’t mean when they say they see no unusual activity in North Korea, that isn’t EXACTLY what they mean."},{"instruction":"Which are the best over ear Bluetooth headphones under ₹5000?","output":"You can check out realme Buds Air Pro It has some of the best features under Rs.5000 : Transparency ModeActive Noise Cancellation94ms Super Low Latency25hrs Total Playback10mm Bass Boost Driver Tip : Buy them through the link given below to get them in minimum price [LINKED_TEXT: realme Buds Air Pro Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Earbuds with Mic, Fast Charging & Up to 25Hrs Playtime (White)realme buds air prohttps://amzn.to/37Ebeab] [URL: https://amzn.to/37Ebeab]"},{"instruction":"the idea of a personal relationship with a deity compatible with philosophical concepts of the transcendent and the ineffable?","output":"Yes. All things are interconnected and all persons already have a personal relationship with the “Independent Self/Person” that is the dynamic/living and self evident/aware Natural Order/Universal Logic - the Logos also known as YHVH - the One True God. Being Transcendental and “Beyond Name” are misleading descriptions in many ways as while true it’s not the full picture. A) just because the Order of Nature is #1 in the Natural Order (God is first in God) and names sit beneath #1 in the Order doesn’t mean that rational names for #1 like “the One” cannot be used. It would merely be a mistake to think #1’s only name is God or Logic exclusively. Likewise being the Transcendent Logic merely means that it is dynamic and universally comprehensive. It is also ubiquitous and is everywhere not just “beyond” (enveloping/comprehending all). We ARE the Logos expressed and our Interconnection with and our shared Root/Soul of the Logos means we can comprehend all else that is not the Logos and even understand (but not cannot comprehend as in “usurp”) the Logos through the Logos. At that point where you understand God and know your own Soul is God then not having a (fully coherent) personal relationship with God would be a contradiction of Logic."},{"instruction":"Did you ever think that if you could convince 1 million people to give you only 1 miserable dollar you would become a millionaire?","output":"This is what is called LEADERSHIP.

Im new to Quora and my writing skills are very bad. I approached Croyez Immigration in the year 2019 and started my Process with them for my work permit which was sponsored by my employer in Canada. I had to submit my letter of invitation from my employer which should also have details related to my accommodation in Canada. I waited for a long time and then since my employer did not provide that letter. Croyez team told not to submit as it could get refused. After three months I similarly received a offer letter again and i approached them and only then i knew that it was a fake offer. Months passed I was slowly losing interest in moving abroad. From day one Croyez team were advising me to apply for a PR and then finally i had no other option and applied for a PR. I got Passport request recently and they were happy to for that. I guess, Im the only person who would have called them for more number of times. Genuine Advice: Immigrating to a new country is not so easy and you need Patience for that. Assess your profile yourself and then approach them for a advise. Definitely they will make it work for you. Moreover, you can apply to them from any part of India/ World. Do not restrict yourself with your city or state.

One of the main fears that exists in narcissists (although they might not admit it) is fear of being abandoned,unloved and not getting the attention they believe is theirs. So when they feel that there’s a danger from you that you might leave them, they do it before you can do it. And then after that,when the narcissist is alone he/she feels the need to get the narcissistic supply (attention,the need to humiliate others,etc). So they unblock you because they feel endangered. And they want to get those supplies again from you.They might also haved blocked you without an apparent reason,and that might be because they were thinking about their fears about you. It can be a lot of things that can make them feel this way. My personal advice is,that you shouldn’t take them seriously,or think about what are their motives,cause it can seriously get you confused. I don’t know if you’re asking this question because you are or have been in a relationship with that person or just asking out of curiosity. But if you were (or still are) i need you and anyone else reading this to know that you deserve better than that.You deserve to be loved by a normal,and emotionally safe person."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between stylized and abstract in art?","output":"Annika Peacock, I think that’s a very good question. The terms are closely related because both suggest some quality that is opposed to realism or naturalism. “Stylized,” however, refers to a quality of decorativeness, often an emphasis on line, especially curved line. Art Nouveau design, for instance, is often described as stylized. Stylized curls cascade from the head of beautiful figures. Stylized botanical forms ornament furniture or architectural elements. Alphonse Mucha, poster for Job cigarette papers, 1896 Victor Horta, Detail from Horta House, Brussels, Belgium, c. 1901 Fashion design is stylized; animation is often stylized. Abstraction is a little different. The term comes from the Latin, ab + trahere or “to draw out of.” An abstract of an article is a few sentences or a paragraph that distills the point of the article. An abstract work of art distorts, exaggerates, obscures and otherwise separates the subject from its appearance in reality. An abstract painting or sculpture can be anything from something that is rather naturalistic to something that is entirely non-objective, or without referent to any visible object. Medardo Rosso, Portrait of Mme. Roblet, 1897–98 Picasso, Portrait of Henri Kahnweiler, fall 1910 Kazimir Malevich, Suprematist Composition (painterly realism of a boy with a knapsack in the fourth dimension), c. 1915–16 Mark Rothko, No. 13 (White, Red on Yellow), 1958 When we use the word “stylized” we talk about a kind of abstraction that tends to be about exaggeration and distortion. It is also true that the term is more commonplace in advertising, commercial art and the decorative arts. The term “abstraction” hangs pretty close to the fine art world but it needs to be used carefully and be fully defined in context."},{"instruction":"What is the best hotel you have ever stayed at, and why?","output":"Every year in September I used to go to Guruvayur temple for darshan with my family, we plan just one day over there and after darshan, we will start back.

Firstly, if you are planning to switch jobs, to move abroad, or even move cities, leasing a car doesn't tie you down, and saves you the hassles of resale, while letting you enjoy the comfort of your own car. Secondly, the world of cars, like technology is constantly evolving. A brand-new car today, can easily become obsolete within 3-5 years. If you are a car-enthusiast, who likes to stay abreast with the latest technology in the world of cars, leasing helps you drive the latest cars, without the tension of resale once you decide to move on. Leasing is also a good option for tax benefits. In my personal experience, since the maintenance and insurance charges on my leased car are deducted from my pretax salary, I have a lower taxable income thereby providing me tax benefit. Also, no hefty down payment means you can use that money for other things. So, leasing turns out to be a more pocket-friendly option! A car lease normally also helps you deal better with things like insurance claim management, wherein the car-leasing company from whom you lease the car will take care of these things. Another significant advantage of leasing a car, are the value-added services that you can easily avail. Door-to-door service, standby car, 24x7 road-side assistance - all these make life so much easier. You also won't have to worry about any unpredictable maintenance costs, if you opt for maintenance along with the car lease - the leasing company will take care of it. All the above-mentioned reasons make leasing a very good option. Also, if you have any other requirement apart from the ones mentioned above, like you would want to retain the car after the lease contract is over, there are leasing companies like ALD Automotive, who have specific products designed to cater to these as well. You can check out more details on car leasing and the various products they offer on their website:[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: http://www.aldautomotive.in/][LINKED_TEXT: https://www.aldautomotive.in/products-services/why-car-leasing] [URL: https://www.aldautomotive.in/products-services/why-car-leasing] Please upvote and share if you like my answer.

Here are some ways to control blood sugar levels: Monitor blood sugar levels: Keep track of your blood sugar levels to see what makes them go up or down. You can do this at home using a portable blood glucose meter, which is known as a glucometer.Eat at regular times and don't skip meals: Choose foods lower in calories, carbohydrates, and sugar. A low-carb diet helps prevent sugar spikes and can have long-term benefits.Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help improve your insulin sensitivity, which means your cells can better use the sugar in your blood, reducing blood sugar levels.

The natural color variations found granite and marble are different between the two stones.Granite has color variations flecking throughout the stone while Marble has color variations resembling the colorful veins swirling through the stone.Granite is resistant to scratches and any damage from heat specifically sun rays. They do not discolor from everyday use. Marble, on the other hand, is lacking in durability as compared to granite. It is a soft material and hence, prone to damage from everyday kitchen activities. It gets scratched easily. It also turns yellow from direct exposure to sunlight over a period of time.Marble is a more porous material that makes it absorb liquid into it leaving stains. Granite is extremely dense and is capable of resisting virtually all types of stains.Both granite and marble need sealing to keep the materials beautiful. Prior to or immediately after installation, a professional will apply a sealant to both materials as a measure of preventing damage.Granite requires sealant less frequently as compared to marble.Marble needs more careful cleaning to avoid damage as it is a porous stone."},{"instruction":"w many seats will BJP win in Lok Sabha 2024?

On Wednesday, he quoted the Libertarians, and by Thursday I would hear about “the current education system in the US” according to billionaire tech wizards in Pao Alto. Every last one of these analysts seemed to have things bass-ackwards. We don’t have an educational system in the US; we have many, many, many educational systems. Our schools are organized from the bottom up, not the top down. Every school district has a local school board, who has wide latitude to do just as it wishes with the student body. The state rarely interferes. The pandemic was one of those rare occasions: state governors declared public health emergencies, and schools, like every other segment of public life, were expected to conform to emergency measures. Schools have plenty of monetary carrots dangled in front of them. Every one of those carrots involve a contract: if you receive the grant money, you will do x, y, and z. Suppose your community doesn’t want to do x, y, and z. Politely decline the funding money. Let each parent pony up a bit more to preserve your school’s independence. But no, most folk don’t want to do that. They want their fellow taxpayers’ money and also do exactly what they want.

There are so many good ideas! Two good ones I have are: Whenever we go shopping my 6yr old used to always beg me for something, whether it was a chocolate, a lolly or a small toy. Now before we enter a shop, I say, ‘If you want something, you may ask once. If you ask me a second time, you will definitely not get it. And whether or not I decide to purchase what you ask for will depend entirely on how you behave in the shop.’ It works well, not only does he usually behave himself, but it also eliminates the begging and nagging that used to always happen.I learnt this from my son's Montessori principal. She speaks very softly as the child/ren have to be very quiet in order to hear what she's saying. I had a friend with an 18mth old living with us who regularly threw epic tantrums. So I decided to try the principals trick and I got down on the floor, took her hands in mine as she squealed and wailed hysterically and I started speaking softly and asking her to calm down as I couldn't fix her problem if she didn't let me know what was wrong. I kept whispering about how much I wanted to fix whatever was wrong etc etc and in between gasps of breath she would hear me saying stuff so she started to calm down and try to hear what I was saying. Eventually she stopped crying and I asked if I could give her a hug. She nodded and sniffled (and wiped that snotty nose on my shoulder lol) and all was fixed.

Their purpose is to serve the public. ... While the Board of Governors is an independent government agency, the Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations.” The Federal Reserve is not to say - IS THE GOVERNMENT - just an player in influencing and effecting the way the character of government plays out politically, and nation’s economics are of weave of consequence. - Privately owned or technically controlled? Read on… It, was it not, the idea of J.P.

At its core, friendship is about mutual respect, trust, and understanding. A true friend is someone who accepts us for who we are, flaws and all, and who supports us through thick and thin. They are there to share in our triumphs and help us navigate the challenges of life.

It's like joining the military and then not willing to go to war. Everything's great until you actually have to man up. Working for a PD isn't any different.

That could come back to haunt you when you have a felony stop and request backup. 💯 These guys will suddenly be on another call and can't help you. Most of the officers I knew would take a bullet for their partner. When people ask this kind of stuff, I always refer them to 9/11 stories. A lot of these officers and firemen knew they were going to die but went anyway. That's called “uncommon valor”. Those guys were God damned heroes. Don't forget it either. If you're a pussy, or not willing to carry your weight, work at the movie theater instead. Lives are depending on your action. When Louisiana and Texas had hurricanes, officers and rescue people came from all over the United States to help. Many cities sent their first responders to New York immediately. That's just something we did. We sent an entire company of firefighters to New York to help out. That's several hundred people. The PD is a warrior culture. There's almost never a problem going to any call you could possibly imagine. When code is being run, you get there ASAP or you're gone. That's the way it should be too. It's fine to question whether or not the job is for you any longer. There's no dishonor in leaving because it's not for you, but as long as you're there, you pitch in. Don't get labeled a coward in that line of work. I got my ass kicked by some diesel lesbian and caught shit over it for year's. That said, every single person I worked for would be there for me. They knew my work ethic was strong and that I would be there for them.

When speaking in terms of an organisation, a leader is someone who always ensures that his/her entire team has all the support and tools that they need to achieve their goals. While there are a lot of qualities that can make an individual a good leader, these are the top 3 characteristics to be on the lookout for: Collaboration and Delegation: A good leader is someone who is able to work well together with his/her team members, and any other stakeholders involved in the project. Along with that, a good leader is able to delegate the different tasks properly to the team members. The goal here isn’t to just get rid of the tasks from one’s own plate, but rather focus on the bigger vision and being able to understand, which step can be carried out more effectively and efficiently by which team member.Communication: To have effective leadership, you need to be a skilled communicator. A good leader is able to communicate in multiple ways - from being able to just give information to the stakeholders, to motivating/inspiring the team members whenever needed, to being able to give/take direct reports whenever needed. A good leader should be able to listen to and also communicate with different people across different job roles within the company.Self-Awareness: This is one of the inward traits of a leader which is paramount in the way they work with a team and also individually. The better they can understand themselves and be able to recognise their own strengths and weaknesses, the more effective they can be as a leader. As he/she will know what areas they need to work on for themselves, in what areas they can let someone else take the lead and in what areas they can bring it all together. A good leader isn’t someone who always walks in front of the team, rather is someone who carries the entire team from the back and lets them shine.

Similarly, the Klingon fans (and tlhIngan Hol and Klingons were really hot back in the Nineties and Noughts at the heyday of Trek fan clubs) organised themselves into factions based on Klingon battleships. And there was the Scots Klingon contingent, who were resplendent in their attention to detail. They did cosplay like no other, and really embraced the warrior spirit of Kahless. Some of them visited The Alien Experience, back when that was a thing in London. You’d go in, full costume, and get vaped like Frost’s squad in Aliens. It was expected of you to get snatched, because they’d pop up from just about anywhere. So the Scots Klingons went in, fully expecting battle, full costume, batleth swords at the ready.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","output":"That depends on several factors…. primarily on the education of the modern Greek and also on age, as older generations got more extensive instruction in Ancient Greek. It also depends on the ancient text and the author. Some ancient texts just lay themselves open while others are more opaque to the modern speaker. I think it’s safe to say that the Hellenistic or Koine Greek of the New Testament (2000 years old) is largely intelligible to most Greeks of a certain age, especially if they have been church goers. With a minimum of adjustment, much of the New Testament is readily comprehensible. I compare it with Shakespearean texts and modern English speakers. The Koine Greek of the NT needs slightly more education than Shakespeare but surprisingly not that much more. Hellenistic texts of later Greek philosophers and Church Fathers are more difficult because of both their content and often deliberate “atticizing” tendancies in certain authors, which is the imitation of Attic Greek forms (the classical Greek of the Attic dialect =Athens). The prestige of the Athenian authors led to a continual atticizing of one degree or another throughout the last 2000 years! When you get to Plato, things get tougher without good schooling. Then again, it’s also author dependent. Xenophon is easier to read than Plato, who was as great a literary figure as he was a philosopher.

Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research 17, 1237–1249. doi:10.1111/cid.12253. Alumina particles are usually used for their low cost, hardness, and needle-like shape but fractures can happen sometimes due to its brittle behavior. It is possible to tailor the obtained topography by varying parameters such particle size, particle shape, kinetic energy, pressure or impact angle. Moreover, the solid particles have to be clean as well as uniform-sized for the preparation of proper surfaces and the choice of the different parameters must avoid excessive damage to the material surface (Ebnesajjad, 2014; Soon et al., 2016; Papageorgiou and Pandis, 2017). It has been shown by Nothdurft et al. (2015) that a rougher surface obtained by sandblasting has favored the adhesion of fibroblast on zirconia. Nevertheless, the use of sandblasting can alter the surface chemistry by alumina contamination but this issue can be resolved by acid etching treatment. Indeed, this technique, discussed in the following section, can allow to remove surface residues"},{"instruction":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","output":"Hi..

It also gets rid of the background dependence that the standard model needed to explain the symmetry on quantum level. The mathematics of this theory is rather difficult to get through though. The smallest unit of which space is made up of is a flux that can be in the form of unmenfisted or menifested energy (i.e. some of them exist in time and some not. Weird!? No worries, LQG theory will explain this for you) and this flux is what is responsible for consciousness which pervades all of the existence(quantum+astronomical+ everything in between).You can go through Pribram Bohm Hypothesis to understand this. Lastly, my assumption is that Black Holes may be decay engines that break even the photons down to smaller units and may be the biggest of these black holes are shredding even those smallest units into these indivisible, indecayable flux of which space is made of. The unmenifested energy may be called dark energy which has 0 frequency thus does'nt exist in time.

Having lived in Mexico off and on for 27 years, I can tell you that the police, military or government will not help you if you are a victim of a crime or an administrative mistake. I see so many naïve North Americans saying they want to live in a quiet off the beaten path village? In my opinion, this is a huge mistake until you become familiar with the language, culture and the customs of Mexico. It is not the United States, Canada or Great Britain. Also, I believe that living in Mexico is best suited for those who are retired and not for people who plan on working in Mexico. I responded: People vary widely and their experiences vary widely. I would hesitate to tell people how they must live if they move to the USA, or to Mexico. Needs and desires vary. Why does sharing a national origin cause some people to think they are in charge of others from the same country. Certainly sharing experiences and giving advice is potentially useful.

Then the group ring [math]A=mathbb{Z}G[/math] sees [math]M’[/math] and [math]M’’[/math] as modules in two different ways by extending these [math]G[/math]-actions in the obvious ways. The trivial action arises from the ring homomorphism [math]mathbb{Z}Gtomathbb{Z}[/math] under which each element of [math]G[/math] maps to 1. A more sophisticated example occurs when [math]A[/math] is the ring of [math]n[/math] by [math]n[/math] matrices over a commutative ring [math]R[/math]. If we take [math]M=A[/math] then we get two actions of [math]A[/math] on [math]M[/math].

The right context for that example is by using a ring isomorphism [math]chicolon Ato A^{mathrm{o}}[/math] (such isomorphisms are very special!) where the domain is the opposite ring of [math]A[/math]. Then the two actions are obtained using left multiplication by [math]a[/math] and right multiplication by [math]chi(a)[/math]. [LINKED_TEXT: Opposite ring - WikipediaMathematical concept In mathematics , specifically abstract algebra , the opposite of a ring is another ring with the same elements and addition operation, but with the multiplication performed in the reverse order. More explicitly, the opposite of a ring ( R , +, ⋅ ) is the ring ( R , +, ∗) whose multiplication ∗ is defined by a ∗ b = b ⋅ a for all a , b in R . [1] [2] The opposite ring can be used to define multimodules , a generalization of bimodules . They also help clarify the relationship between left and right modules (see § Properties ). Monoids , groups , rings, and algebras can all be viewed as categories with a single object . The construction of the opposite category generalizes the opposite group , opposite ring, etc. Relation to automorphisms and antiautomorphisms [ edit ] In this section the symbol for multiplication in the opposite ring is changed from asterisk to diamond, to avoid confusion with some unary operation. A ring R {displaystyle R} having isomorphic opposite ring is called a self-opposite ring, [3] [4] [a] which name indicates that R op {displaystyle R^{text{op}}} is essentially the same as R {displaystyle R} . All commutative rings are self-opposite. Let us define the antiisomorphism ι : ( R , ⋄ ) → ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle iota colon (R,diamond )to (R,cdot )} , where ι ( a ) = a {displaystyle iota (a)=a} for a ∈ R {displaystyle ain R} . [b] It is indeed an antiisomorphism, since ι ( a ⋄ b ) = a ⋄ b = b ⋅ a = ι ( b ) ⋅ ι ( a ) {displaystyle iota (adiamond b)=adiamond b=bcdot a=iota (b)cdot iota (a)} . The antiisomorphism ι {displaystyle iota } can be defined generally for semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, rngs, algebras. In case of rings (and rngs) we obtain the general equivalence. A ring [c] is self-opposite if and only if it has at least one antiautomorphism. Proof: ⇒ {displaystyle Rightarrow } : Let ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle (R,cdot )} be self-opposite. If f : ( R , ⋅ ) → ( R , ⋄ ) {displaystyle fcolon (R,cdot )to (R,diamond )} is an isomorphism, then ι ∘ f {displaystyle iota circ f} , being a composition of antiisomorphism and isomorphism, is an antiisomorphism from ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle (R,cdot )} to itself, hence antiautomorphism. ⇐ {displaystyle Leftarrow } : If g : ( R , ⋅ ) → ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle gcolon (R,cdot )to (R,cdot )} is an antiautomorphism, then ( ι − 1 ∘ g ) : ( R , ⋅ ) → ( R , ⋄ ) {displaystyle (iota ^{-1}circ g)colon (R,cdot )to (R,diamond )} is an isomorphism as a composition of two antiisomorphisms. So ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle (R,cdot )} is self-opposite. and If ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle (R,cdot )} is self-opposite and the group of automorphisms Aut ⁡ ( R , ⋅ ) {displaystyle operatorname {Aut} (R,cdot )} is finite, then the number of antiautomorphisms equals the number of automorphisms. Proof: By the assumption and the above equivalence there exist antiautomorphisms.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"GPs in the UK have patients, not clients. NHS services are free at the point of delivery. If you go to your GP, they will listen to your story and look at your medical records. Doctors have been on their guard against self-diagnosis by patients since at least the 19th century. There is a famous passage in Three Men in a Boat about it. As a general rule if you go to a doctor with concerns about your health, the doctor will take them seriously. They will not, however, take your advice about what tests you should be having: it’s their job, as a medical professional, to make that assessment. A doctor’s first job is safety: ‘first, do no harm’. Every invasive test brings with it a small risk. Unnecessary tests are not doing you any favours. After safety comes effectiveness. If you keep testing patients, eventually you will find something unusual. Fixing that unusual thing may do no good. The process to fix it may do harm, or it may get in the way of other things that should have been happening. Without any symptoms at all, it is difficult to test for anything. While listening to you, a doctor will already be making an assessment—colour of your skin, unusual movements or posture, breathing patterns, changes in the way you talk. There are some basic tests such as blood, stool and urine samples which they can order just as a precaution. However, sending you for a full MRI scan ‘just in case’ is not part of the NHS cancer-screening programme. Doctor’s also need to think about patient experience. If you come in worried unnecessarily about cancer, and they feed your worries by sending you for unnecessary tests, then they are making your life worse, not better."},{"instruction":"What are some reasons I should stop watching Bollywood movies?","output":"YOU SHOULD NOT STOP WATCHING BOLLYWOOD MOVIES BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT TIME TO WATCH NEW TYPE OF STORIES.

One of them is that the abuser is very good at being manipulative. He or she can be utterly horrible one day and then extremely apologetic the next. They’ll tell the abused that they’re sorry, they love them, and they’ll never do it again. They may even act decently to the abused for days or weeks. It sucks the abused person in to believing that yes, this time, the abused really is going to change for the better. It’s the circle of abuse. The abuser then will always start back up abusing the other person. It’s just a matter of time. However, the abused person has a self-esteem so low by this point that they can’t see clearly what is going on. Financially for many abused people, it’s almost impossible to leave or that’s how they feel. My abuser had me so cut off from everyone that I was embarrassed to actually ask anyone for help. I still had family that I could turn to, but when you find yourself in that position, it’s hard to realize that your family is still your family no matter what. Even if I hadn’t had family, there are always resources to help abused people. I found that out once I did file an order of protection against my ex. The number of resources that were offered to me was astounding. I was lucky that I didn’t need all of them, but so many abused people never get to the point of being able to use any. Which brings me to my last point. That order of protection doesn’t give you a coat of armor. It is only as good as the abuser wants to make it, and the abused will make it. A lot of abusers are still going to come around no matter whether there’s an order of protection or not. If they’re intent on causing harm to the abused, they will do it. Having said that, some abused people will often ask their abusers to come back even after filing an order of protection. They’re so caught up in that circle of abuse that they almost have to be back in it. Breaking the circle of abuse is very difficult. It takes building up of self esteem, will power, sometimes therapy and help getting away. I had my children to worry about. They gave me the impetus to get away. The rest came after that."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"buy best book share karobar &mutual fund mein nivesh in hindi by shri vinod pustak mandir online from amazon ,flipcart ,snapdeal"},{"instruction":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","output":"The only thing Donald has been successful with is self destruction."},{"instruction":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a nongeared twowheeler over a geared one?","output":"There is nothing like no geared vehicle every vehicle have gears.

How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","output":"Just like direct equity, brokerages and research houses declare a list of top or hot Mutual Funds. These are based on research and rankings provided by some institution like Morningstar or Value Research. These ratings keep changing over a period of time, depending upon the market conditions, the performance of the fund over a period of time, etc. They are just an indication of the performance and it would be risky to follow these ratings and decide the investment. There are many factors that go into the selection of a Mutual Fund and they are the performance ratios like the Sorento Ratio, Beta, Alpha, etc which one needs to understand in order to select the fund. However, there is no guarantee that the hot fund or the recommended fund that is performing today will perform tomorrow. Therefore it would be naive to rely on the ratings alone and make the investment. They may give an broad understanding to the direction, but ultimately one needs to check his or own judgment also and analyze the risk factors associated with the fund before making the investment.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"The Electoral College, broken as it is, protects Americans from the Tyranny Of The Majority. Take a fictional country with a population of 10 million and an area of 100 thousand square miles. 9 million people live in an area of 100 square miles along the west coast, which is divided into 9 States, and lean heavily Conservative. The remaining one million people live in the other 99000 square miles in the nation’s hinterlands, which is divided into 12 States, and is mainly populated by numerous Liberal and/or Progressive Farming communities who are gender-egalitarian and racially and sexually diverse. Now imagine if, due to direct democracy, the 9 million Conservative urbanites are consistently able to elect Conservative Presidents through sheer numbers, the one million rural Liberals and Progressives living inland being basically crowded out of the National Government. And whenever the Conservatives legislate economic or social policies that benefit Conservatives, the Liberals are basically unable to stop it. If this continues for too long, these rural Liberals will start resenting the affluent and snobbish Conservative “Coastal Elites” and their “Regressive Objectivist” morals as undermining their culture of family and community in favor of blind selfishness. If this country had an electoral college, the 9 coastal urban Conservative States get 4 Electoral votes each, and the 12 inland rural Liberal and Progressive States get 3 Electoral votes each, giving the inland States equal representation (36 Electoral votes) to the coastal States in the National Government. Do you get the idea of an Electoral College now? BTW, I chose the low-population inland States to be Liberal and the high-population Coastal States to be Conservative mainly because it is the inverse of the US Demographics, so that Liberals can understand why Conservatives like the Electoral College."},{"instruction":"Do appeals courts hold trials?","output":"Appeals Courts do not receive adduced evidence, but do refer to transcripts of the lower court trial, and hear arguments on elements of law relevant to the appeal."},{"instruction":"Why can I never get wood chisels as sharp as when they are brand new?","output":"Brand new chisels are rarely sharpened; they are just bevel ground.

As a result opera arias tend to be no more than a few sentences long, where musical numbers are quite often several paragraphs. There’s a great scene in the movie Amadeus where the court members are arguing about what language an opera that Mozart has been commissioned to compose should be in. Finally he says something to the tune of “pick whatever language you want, it doesn’t matter, it will be the best opera ever written.” As the emperor would say “There it is.”"},{"instruction":"Should I learn HTML and CSS in a time where everyone is making websites with WordPress?

A co worker told my boss that I was sleeping on the job during naptime at a school because she was calling to me from the other side of a partition and couldn't see me but I didn't answer because I thought she was talking to another teacher on the other side. My boss believed me over her. Another time, one of my co workers straight up lied to my boss and told them I had told children in my classroom that dinosaurs walked the earth at the same time as humans because she knew I was a Christian and didn't like me for my views on certain things that we had discussed outside of work hours. So she basically got me let go, even though they never asked me about this supposed incident that never happened (they didn't want to rehire me for the next school year but the joke was on them because I had already started searching for another job because I didn't like working there anyway). Another time a co worker tried to get me fired after a month of working with her because I wasn't pulling my weight in the classroom by helping her with the bulletin boards. When I had tried to help she had told me she'd rather do it all so I let her. When I told my boss this in our meeting, all three of us present, she turned beet red and admitted that it was true. To be honest she's the one who ought to have been fired. I left that job about a year later. Yet another time, a co worker tried to get me fired by complaining about me not doing certain things that I was supposed to be doing but had no idea. I was new to the job and she was supposed to be training me… but she obviously wasn't doing her job very well as I still had never been given a list of my daily duties or taught how to do them all and when (this was in a head start preschool program). When she called a meeting and complained to my boss about it all right there in front of me, our boss looked at her and told her, “it's only been a month and you're supposed to be training her. You know there's a lot to learn with this job, So the fault is yours if she still doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing.” It was very satisfying to be defended. They ended up moving her to a different location, paired with someone else because she kept giving me problems and there was an incident that occurred shortly after this that was the last straw for me- I told them I was quitting or they had to move her somewhere else. They moved her."},{"instruction":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","output":"um FDR, anybody? LBJ? Not that anybody can remember that far back in America. Note that none of the current crop of Dems will ever accomplish anything with the usual bunch of idiot voters failing to hold them to their 'get rid of big money in politics' empty promises. There is no right/left in America, only thieves who buy the law openly with no objection from either party nor from enough voters that could ever matter. A party that plans to do nothing for anybody worth less than 100 million than block any laws that don't rob them is definitely not leftwing and isn't even really rightwing, it is effectively a bunch of damned devil worshipping thieves and that is unquestionably very nearly the only track record of either party for decades. The fact that Americans are incapable of looking critically at their own party means neither party will ever have to reform. Hilariously, people think commies are elected or that somehow voting to the left of the John Birch Society turns all countries into Pol Pot Stalinist socialism. I never talk to one of these people who actually knows how communism happens or ever bothered to research it in the slightest. Name a first world country that elected communists and just because of that became a socialist dictatorship. Ever. I'll wait. Commies do not come from social democratic policies any more than they come from evil unicorn gods. They always always always come from basically right wing nations that failed due to the incompetence that is inherent in nations that are not functional republics and are run by thieves pretending to be something else with the ignorant and stupid cooperation of the citizens of the nation. Look, the rest of the world is giggling at us or attacking us because we are so laughably incompetent that we are unable to tell openly admitted thieves from actual politicians-and that isn't even disputable. That has NOTHING to do with left or right or any political philosophy at all. At least I can say that the policies of the alleged left and right major parties in the US are the best possible policies for creating a communist state. Not because of any remote alleged liberalism of anything here (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, oh Man, hahahahaahhahahaha) , but because only the pain from extreme longterm governmental incompetence can eventually cause a revolt here. Clearly being right wing with zero liberal ideas in your nation is no help against communism. Cuba. Russia. China. Right wing junta style incompetent totalitarian regimes to the last one. Until they kept the pot on too tight in a nation full of ignorant people with zero political IQ. That sounds like the America I know. That sounds like a place with democrats and republicans vying to see how far up a lobbyist's butt they can fit and a people who were never going to do anything about it. That does not sound liberal nor does it sound conservative, it is just stupid."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"In the United States, the foods most commonly eaten for breakfast vary greatly depending on the region and culture of the individual.

A month after I broke it off with her, she told me she was pregnant with my baby. At first I thought she was lying, but she was in fact pregnant. She did not want me present when giving birth. When the DNA test came back proving the baby boy was not mine, I was relieved to the point that I went out with a few friends and celebrated.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"Good question! As the CEO of ThunderQuote, I have a two part answer to to this: What I do on a strategic levelWhat I do on a day-to-day basis Strategically, the CEO is in charge of four main things: The first, is the vision- the company’s reason for existing. He sets the core belief of the company that guides everyone in it, and communicates this identity and purpose to the outside world. The second, is problem detection & solving. The CEO has to keep the big picture in mind, and with that, looks around his or her business and identifies the key areas that need work. The third, is resource gathering. The CEO, understanding the vision/direction, now knows what is missing (problem detection), and what resources are needed for the company to grow to the next level. Are more finances needed? What kind of people are needed for the next stage and how will the company attract them? The fourth, is motivating the team. The CEO is the drummer and banner-man of the company- he sets the pace and energises the team to move harder, faster, and create better work. On a day to day basis, a usual day (at office) for me goes as follows: Wake up at 7–8am Do additional reading about a topic relevant to the business stage the startup is at (validation, marketing, growth, scaling up etc.) Go for morning meeting with prospective BD partners or clients. Head in to office, say hello to everyone and ensure things are proceeding fine for the day. Work on strategic / high-intensity work as soon as possible, alone. Lunch at desk, discuss with operations about things which haven’t yet been completed. (Or, lunch meeting with prospects or advisor/mentor) Latter half of afternoon, clear up lower brain power work (follow-ups), social media posting and writing content for the company blogs + founder blogs. Meet individually with people from various roles to see how they’re coping, and set up new projects for testing / iteration. Look into the various metrics of the business to see if anything needs more work. Debrief the company as a whole at 6–7.30pm. Go for evening meetings (up to 2 per night) until midnight. Reach home by 1am, rush out extra content writing or growth hacking projects for social media. Sleep by 3am-4am. As you can see, the work is broken down by energy level and degree of thought required. In the morning when I am fresh, I seek to do more planning and strategy work. In the afternoon, I look to do menial work and get updated with various parts of the business and look for things that have been overlooked.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"Missouri has not voided Federal Gun Laws. What they have done is said that local law enforcement agencies cannot support Federal Gun Law enforcement. This has actually come to a head in one instance where local law enforcement would not take part in a Federal DEA raid because there was a suggestion that the person the DEA wanted to arrest might have had guns. The DEA went ahead with the arrest of the person without local authority help. If I am not mistaken though, I do believe that local law enforcement is allowed to arrest Federal Law Enforcement officials who try and enforce federal gun laws. The department of justice may not like this, but until Missouri engages in such an arrest, I am not sure there is anything they can do about it. Interesting to me, the DOJ does not like this, but they are not complaining about immigration sanctuary cities, so their complaints are hollow and meaningless."},{"instruction":"w do truck drivers and bus drivers avoid using the bathroom when they have a weak bladder and they are stuck in traffic?","output":"I don't know about bus drivers.

We barely even have a left-wing party in the United States. What we really have is a far-right one and a center-right one. Bill Clinton’s triangulation strategy pulled the Democratic Party hard to the right, and it hasn’t really recovered. As a result, and thanks to court rulings that determined money is speech, both major parties are now full of politicians who serve wealthy corporate interests rather than the interests of the people. And so we end up with Democratic politicians who talk a progressive game and then get elected and tell us why we just can’t afford to have affordable education or single-payer healthcare. And the candidates who really would bring about significant change to the system — like Tusli Gabbard and her opposition to our interventionist foreign policy — are by turns smeared and ignored by the corporate media that serves up propaganda for the ruling class. Bernie would be center-left in any European democracy. That’s about as “extreme” as the Democratic field gets. Maybe they seem far left because the Republicans have moved so far right.

People have been breeding large dogs for centuries, and there are many breeds that are considered large. However, compared to some of the largest wild cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, these dogs are not considered to be “big” in the same way. This begs the question, why are there no big dogs? To answer this, it is important to look at the evolutionary history of both cats and dogs. Cats and dogs both evolved from ancient carnivorous mammals. Cats evolved from the Felidae family, while dogs evolved from the Canidae family. Though they share similarities, cats and dogs have distinct differences in their evolutionary history and development. Cats are considered to be apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This led to the development of cats being solitary hunters and having a natural instinct to protect themselves from danger. Cats also evolved to have longer bodies, larger heads, and powerful claws for hunting prey. Their agility, strength, and stealth are unmatched in the animal kingdom. This allowed cats to evolve into larger species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, to better hunt their prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a pack-based hunter and scavenger lifestyle. Dogs’ survival depended on their ability to work together in a group and hunt or scavenge whatever food they could find. This led to the development of dogs having shorter bodies, smaller heads, and weaker claws for scavenging. Dogs are not considered to be apex predators, and therefore have not evolved into larger species like cats have. In addition, the domestication of dogs has also played a role in the lack of large dogs. Cats were domesticated much later than dogs, and their domestication has not altered their natural predatory instincts as much as it has with dogs. Dogs, on the other hand, have been domesticated for thousands of years and have developed a close relationship with humans. This has led to the selective breeding of dogs to be smaller and less aggressive, and has eliminated any natural instinct to survive without human help. The combination of evolutionary history and domestication has led to the lack of large breeds of dogs. Cats were able to evolve into larger species due to their natural predatory instincts, while dogs were bred to be smaller and less aggressive due to their domestication. Therefore, when it comes to large or “big” dogs, there are simply none that exist today. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

These different types of dentistry can create confusion in potential patients. The better they understand the differences, the easier it will be to have their dental needs met. People are often confused about the difference between general dentistry and cosmetic dentistry. Each is special in its area, but both share many skills. WHAT IS GENERAL DENTISTRY? General dentistry is a field of dentistry that addresses dental problems associated with oral hygiene, dental pain, and discomfort. It typically includes procedures like tooth extraction, root canals, and cavity filling. General dentists are the primary dental healthcare providers for people of all ages. They are not focused on any particular aspect of dental practices but instead provide a wide range of services. These services are vital for continued dental health as well as physical health and can include the following: Preventive servicesRestorative servicesCosmetic proceduresOverall health concerns WHAT IS COSMETIC DENTISTRY? Cosmetic dentistry is a field of dentistry that focuses on addressing dental aesthetics. It concentrates on the repair of worn, discolored, broken, chipped, misshapen, and stained teeth, as well as dental gaps. Cosmetic dentistry concentrates on giving you a bright smile; it is a smile makeover. The different procedures performed by cosmetic dentists include the following: Teeth whiteningDental veneersDental bondingDental crownsInlays and onlaysDental implantsDental bridges WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE FIELDS? A cosmetic dentist has the same basic training as a general dentist. They can perform all necessary procedures that a general dentist can do, such as X-rays, teeth cleaning, and other fundamental techniques. Both general and cosmetic dentists can fill cavities and add bridges, crowns, and veneers. Both can also apply braces and perform other restorative procedures. The main difference between cosmetic dentistry and general dentistry is that if you are concerned about how your teeth look, visiting a cosmetic dentist will provide you with your highest-quality aesthetic results. A general dentist cares for the basic dental needs of your whole family, while a cosmetic dentist concentrates more on the aesthetics of the patient’s smile. Both cosmetic and general dentists can fill a cavity. However, a cosmetic dentist will concentrate on how your teeth will look afterwards and can use a composite filling to match your teeth color. SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT WITH A SKILLED DENTIST While both fields overlap each other, you must visit a dentist based on your needs rather than just on a recommendation. If you have been experiencing cosmetic or health issues with your teeth, Dr. Dan Miller is your ideal choice. At Valley Dental Works, we offer cosmetic and family dentistry.

The best approach depends on the specific situation and purpose. Here are some common methods to increase soil depth: 1. Importing Topsoil: Bringing in additional topsoil can increase the overall depth and improve the soil's fertility. Ensure the topsoil is of good quality and free from contaminants. 2. Composting: Regularly adding compost to the soil can enhance its organic matter content, improving fertility and structure over time. 3. Mulching: Applying organic mulch, like wood chips or straw, helps protect the soil, reduces erosion, and adds organic matter as it breaks down. 4. Terrace Gardening: For sloped areas, creating terraces with retaining walls can help prevent erosion and provide flat, deeper soil layers. 5. Raised Beds: Building raised beds above existing soil levels allows you to control the depth and quality of the growing medium. 6. Sheet Mulching: This involves layering organic materials like cardboard, newspapers, compost, and mulch to build up soil depth and suppress weeds. 7. Soil Excavation: For construction or landscaping projects, soil can be moved and redistributed to create deeper areas. 8. Contouring: Adjusting the land's contour can create swales or depressions that accumulate organic matter and water, leading to deeper soil. 9. No-Till Farming: Practicing no-till farming techniques minimizes soil disturbance, promoting soil health and deeper root penetration. It's important to consider the specific requirements of the plants you intend to grow and the local environmental conditions when choosing the best method. Consulting with a local agricultural extension office or a landscape professional can provide valuable insights and guidance for your particular situation. Additionally, consider any environmental regulations or permits that might be necessary when altering the landscape or importing soil."},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test? If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"No. But I knew a family that really needed a test done. The father and mother split. The woman was a cheat. Didn't know The boy existed for awhile. The father fell in love again and was caring for his critically ill wife 24/7. Man was told he has a son from his previous relationship. The boy was… possessed. Criminally minded. A real sicko. Disturbed. He gave me the creeps. The man worked hard to help the boy and parent but he seldom saw him. The father could barely work because of his 2nd wife's illness. And I don't think he felt comfortable with the boy being around his wife. The boy, a teen, refused to participate in a DNA testing. I'm sure the mother told him not to as they needed the child support. I think the boy also wanted to escape his mother so he needed this man to continue to be his “father”. He was 15 when I saw him standing there with his “dad”. They didn't look related biologically. To me DNA testing should be done for health and legal reasons at birth on every child."},{"instruction":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","output":"Which South Indians are you referring to?

We only saw a small part of it sticking out from under a little bush and, with a few tugs from all of us, managed to drag it out of its bushy prison. We were amazed at the sheer enormity of this strange new object and at how friggin heavy it was. It took me and both my little brothers just to lift it knee height and take a few steps before dropping it. It looked like a sword but not the kind you see in books or movies so we were confused about what it was. It not everyday you stumble upon a sword in Canada, especially one shaped so funny. We obviously couldn't haul it to the house with how tiny we were so we ran home to share the news with our parents. They were a little shocked to hear that we found a sword out in the bush and advised us not to go back there again. We were a little disappointed that nobody went to investigate and I never did go back to see if it was still there. But I think my uncle went to claim it after my dad mentioned it to him, he was always looking for a way to make a quick buck. Probably tried to pawn it if he found it but I never looked any further into that. We moved from there shortly after to another part of town.

While Bitcoin is the most renowned cryptocurrency, many other cryptocurrencies exist in circulation. The key appeal of cryptocurrencies is their potential to offer a decentralized alternative to conventional currency systems by operating on blockchain technology without the involvement of intermediaries like governments or central banks. While some view cryptocurrencies as a valuable investment due to their unique properties and potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, others see them as speculative assets with an uncertain future. It's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies involves risks, as they are a developing technology. Cryptocurrency markets can be highly volatile, prone to rapid price fluctuations, and lack tangible assets or government backing, making them susceptible to hacking, fraud, and other risks. To make an informed decision about investing in cryptocurrencies, potential investors should consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

It helps deal with the content effectively, providing a lot of opportunities for its reasonable management. However, before using a content management system, you need to choose its type that will be appropriate for your company. A headless one is more relevant for most businesses. So, get acquainted with the advantages of a headless CMS. 1. Immense number of presentation layers One of the characteristics of a headless content management system is its scalability. It enables you to display the content across various platforms and gadgets without ruining it. It is possible because of the separation of the front-end from the back-end. 2. Enhanced performance Due to its headless architecture, a CMS serves the content via API, which enables it to share the information faster. Also, through API, it delivers content to different platforms and devices and attracts more users. 3. Cost-effectiveness A headless CMS can save your business money. Thanks to high performance and reasonable work organization, it decreases the workload for developers. Besides, the content can be reached and reused without additional costs. 4. Better security With a headless CMS, bugs will lead to fewer problems, as the back-end is not connected so tightly to the front-end like in the traditional content management system. So, the potential attack will affect only the presentation layer and will not cause the fall of the whole system.

I would characterize most Kannadigas as introverts. We tend to mind our own business and not indulge in public display of our love for our language and culture. This is true at least with most Kannadigas. Our ancestors built great empires and our land was and still is the abode of arts, music, culture, literature, science, spirituality and the intellect. Historically, we have been more politically stable than most other parts, and this played a big role in our people turning inwards rather than outwards. We are also know for our humility and we would gladly speak to someone in their language rather than imposing Kannada on them. This makes us blend into any host culture or region without our linguistic or cultural heritage known. Others have pointed out few well known Kannadigas and I would like to include two more to support my argument that our culture drives us to discover the true nature of ourselves and the world we inhabit.

Isolation, fierce looks of disapproval, and fear dominated life, like the Dark Ages. I learned to lie without a smirk or a sweat bead, to hide any personal items or facts or dislikes; to voice discontent was to offend the most high and receive severe punishment. Inconsistent. Chaotic. The rules changed as my role models became more and more religious (zealous). I became more and more uncertain what was accepted, I feared asking and making myself fair game for belittling. In adulthood I feared making any sound during 7 childbirths, on my 8th I began to speak up a little. I still bit my tongue; I was less-than any form of authority. I'd been long since punished out of my will to say No. And then I started being strict to my children. My role models were hurtful, deranged, and became hostile; my husband's behaviors fit within that norm. I didn't know safety. My distrust of the world was brainwashed in, well. Obedience or burn in hell/be rejected by God. We isolated by home schooling, home churching, and staying “out of the world\\" a lot. My abusive, manipulative mate took liberty after liberty until after 23 years, I snapped. I've been 8 yrs, divorced. I'm tough --but, from torment and lack of mercy, under scraps of affection in return for my obedience and submission. How terribly sorrowful that is for me to accept. How wicked for them to bend and crush down such a vibrant spirit. I am grieving for baby, child, teen, twenty, thirty,forty-something me for being so sacrificing of self for the comfort of others.

It was no surprise that #SushantSinghRajput’s last hurrah #DilBechara was going to rake up a lot of views. I settled down to watch the film with very little expectation but wasn’t prepared for the multiple jolts in store! Any film that releases after the protagonist’s death rises in stature and is rendered tough to review as just another film. Watching it was a surreal experience and Sushant’s easy, toothy grin, naturally spiked hair and romantic charm just made it all the more unreal. ASHOK’s FIVE reasons to watch #DilBechara, released worldwide on the #DisneyPlusHotstar platform. The film has been made available for everyone including non-subscribers as a tribute to Sushant’s legacy and I am glad this was just a simple message on the screen rather than a commercial hook or publicity stunt. 1. Based on John Green’s book, “The Fault in our Stars”, director #MukeshChhabra tells the story of two young cancer patients finding love. They are too young to die and too full of life to succumb to the big C easily. It is a tale of fun, laughter, romance and relationships. It is also a story of the unpredictability of life and how unusual situations can foster bonding between people. It raises questions about the meaning of existence and is also an ode to celebrating life. Along the way, the dialogues shake you up out of the light and breezy narrative. The first half sets up pretty and demure Kizie Basu (#SanjanaSanghi) and her sheltered but lonely life quite well. Her parents played by Saswata Chatterjee and Swatika Mukherjee fuss over her; a typical Bengali family settled in Jamshedpur. And then there is Pushpinder, the oxygen cylinder that is her constant companion. All the roshogollas and the sondeshes in the world cannot shake off the pall of gloom over the household. Enter Manny aka Immanuel Rajkumar Junior, a bundle of energy, crooked teeth and pathetic jokes. Seri…. now what? He teaches her to laugh, star in a movie, live it up, visit Paris and fall in love with life all over again. 2. “Khud ko maarna saala illegal hai, toh jeena padta hai [It’s illegal to kill yourself, so you’ve to live]” is what Abhimanyu Veer, the maverick musician (#SaifAliKhan in a cameo) shouts at the couple when they meet him in Paris. And from this moment onwards, I lost track of the plot as focus shifted only to #SushantSinghRajput and his histrionics. Truth is stranger than fiction they say but this is eerie. I wonder if these lines should have been edited out of the film perhaps? Manny lives life on his own terms. We see very little of his parents and granny. The mystery shrouding him in the film seems poignant now. ‘Janam kab lena hai aur marna kab hai, hum decide nahi kar sakte. Par kaise jeena hai woh hum decide kar sakte hain’ he says. 3. The challenge with book adaptations is that a good story alone does not make for a great film. Writers Suprotim Sengupta and Shashank Khetan do manage to provide a light and breezy tone to offset the depressing backdrop and Sushant’s brilliance complements that well. Whether it is the Rajni obsession, throwing eggs at a friend’s house or the very cute expressions, he can pull it all off. You remain almost indulgent to his ways. #DilBechara remains at the same level throughout and does not rise to the potential of the story. 4. #ARRahman and #Amitabh Bhattacharya is a potent combination and the music is eminently hummable – the friendzone title track, Taare Gin or Khulke Jeene Ka are all soothing and pleasant on the senses. The entire dance sequence for Friendzone was shot in one take, choreographed by Farah Khan and is testimony to Sushant’s talent. 5. Sawata and Swastika are a refreshing new combination and emote their parts effortlessly. The scene where Manny and Kizie’s dad bond over beer in the rain is brilliantly written. Manny talks about his dreams but how he is unable to fulfil all of them. Supporting the cast is Manny’s friend JP, Jagdish Pandey (#SahilVaid) who is also undergoing treatment for cancer of the eyes. The scene where JP and Kizie do the mock funeral speeches for Manny are overwhelming. I think one of the things that we forget about people afflicted by long term illnesses is that the only thing they want is to be like us. As Kizie says “I don’t want to be strong; I want to be normal” One cannot write a review of #DilBechara without a reference to the untimely passing of the gifted young man and the ugly conversations on social media. On the one hand, the film provides closure to the legacy of a talent who had immense potential; any conversation that can help throw light on what upcoming talent has to endure in the industry is constructive. Any conversation that is simply leveraging the incident to spite people or create chaos is unwelcome. For now, lets hope #SushantSinghRajput finds peace wherever he is.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"So… that has never happened to me fore obvious reasons but if I was in your shoes here is what I would consider. The child, in no way, chose their parent and their parent’s traits. Consider the child’s age for once, how old is the child? Because if the child is a baby then what’s is the point in leaving the child’s life. It probably does not know if you are or are not the parent but he/she still needs you in their life. I grew up with both parents in my life and the thought of missing one parent is just terrible to me. Even if the child has another parent, does it not need a role model that shows them that family is not about the blood but the relationship that made. If the child is older, try talking to them (make sure to be talk during both situations throughout the conversation) and see if they know. If they did, ask them why they did not tell you. Everybody has their reason for doing something so try your best to try and get the real reason why. If they do not, smile and tell them it is okay, because that child already has a bond formed with you and they see you as their parent or guardian. You telling them that they are not yours could make them break down but in any case you need to be there for them when they do and assure them that things will be okay. Another thing, consider your own feelings. I don’t know for how long, but you already have a mental bond with the child when you thought it was yours. I cannot for sure say what is going on in your mind because I do not have that power but I can say this: consider these points before making a decision. “Was it the child’s fault that they are not your child?” “Are you going to be content after throwing this relationship?” “Will it not hurt your morals knowing that an innocent person is suffering the consequence of someone’s decisions?” Whatever happens in the end is all up to you. -Love Moka"},{"instruction":"What is the future tense of teach?","output":"I will teach them.

The Maru gets lost. The Maru has an agenda that brought it there. The Maru is on a secret mission for starfleet. They are working for section 31. It's a plot to start a war with the Klingons. It's a shot ship not a fuel carrier. And that would just be the reason for it being on the side of the Klingons. They change it for the cadets. So there is the possibility Data COULD fail.

But Bible Numerics is interested in the patterns of the letters of the Scriptures, for example Genesis 1:1 is 7 words of 28 letters, and 28=4*7. Ivan Panin found many more patterns of 7s, in both the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, so much so, that he made his own variations, to complete the patterns even, as some versions seemed to have incomplete patterns. Ivan Panin 1855 to 1942, is considered the Father of Bible Numerics, but it is actually older, as hand copying Scribes have used patterns between the Hebrew letters to check their copying, for thousands of years. Today in Israel mainly, new patterns are being found with the help of computers, that are not only to do with the number 7. Here is some of my own in this Signature message I have used: [The first 6 primes are 2 3 5 7 11 13, and their digit order reversed is 31 11 7 5 3 2. It is my belief that the Crucifixion happened on the 31st year AD, and on the 117th day of that year, and at the 532nd minutes after a theoretical 6 AM Dawn, that being 2:52 PM. For comparison the Ninth hour is 540 minutes after a theoretical 6 AM Dawn, that being 3 PM, or 15:00 hours, or the 9th hour. The old measure of time in Jerusalem was from the dawn, that is normally about 6 AM, The 117th day is the 27th of April, the 4th Month. The Solar Eclipse, hints of a clue God is giving us. It is where I found the date, and then eventually the time of the Crucifixion. By looking at numbers to do with a Month : A Calendar Month is most often 31 days in a year, and it is 4 weeks, and it is 2 Fortnights, and a week is 7 days, and from those numbers 31 4 27 can be made. Some Women mark a Calendar with the Greek letter Pi, and Pi=3.14159265358... in Math, which is round up able to 3.1415927, which has the numbers 31 4 15 9 27. P is the 16th letter and i is the 9th, and 169=13*13 like 31 reversed! Pi is the 16th letter of the Greek Alphabet, and a mirror put under the word Pi, looks like a 61, and 61 is the reverse of 16! There is a grey patch on the Moon with a sort of n shape, which is also roughly the shape of the Greek letter Pi. The Moon Geologists, can not explain what made the grey part. The Moon is 31 Minutes of a Degree Arc angular width! Some say that the word Month should be spelt Moonth, and adding up from Moonth, 13+15+15+14+20+8=85 1+3+1+5+1+5+1+4+2+0+8=31. From 85 and 31, both the Date and Time can be made, 85=1*5*1*17 31 or 15:00 Hours on the 117th day of 31 AD! From the 12 Months of the Calender, a Binary number can be made, from all the Months with 31 days 1010 1011 0101, which is 2741 in Decimal. 2741 is the 40th Prime, and 2741-40=2701, and the 7 words, that make 28=4*7 Letters, of Genesis 1:1, in Hebrew, are also 28 numbers, that add to 2701, the most well known 4 digit number in Biblical Numerology, or more particularly of these things Bible Numerics! The initials of Bible Numerics, B.N. can make the number 214, and 214=107*2 which is like 1072, the reverse of 2701, and 2701+1072=3773, and 2701=37*73, Praise God! Adding the digits of the Hebrew numbers is 82, which is 28 reversed, or 58 in a mirror. The title \\"Holy Bible\\" has the initials H.B., that are the 8th and 2nd letters! 40=5*8*1 and 581 has 123 and 321 on each side of it in the Fibonacci Series 1123581321! 1/58=0.01724137931034482758620689655 which repeats every 28 numbers, and there in 0.0172413 is reversed 31 4 27, with a 172 for the 172 minutes past noon! From the number Pi=3.14158265358..., the Phrase \\"Ca do I Zec 58\\" can be made, so try to figure out what Zechariah 5:8 means... warning it is very controversial! The last 3 numbers 358, as 3/58=0.05172413, and which reversed is 31427150.0, having both the date and time! Thus 1/58 and 3/58 emphasize the 85 and 31 from the word Moonth! Adding the 28 numbers from 1/58 mentioned above, 1+7+2+4+1+3+7+9+3+1+0+3+4+4+8+2+7+5+8+6+2+0+6+8+9+6+5+5=126=3*7*3*2, and 3732 looks like the ancient Hebrew name of God, called the Tetragrammaton! 2 times 126 is 252, making a symmetrical 2*3*7*3*2=252 and like 2:52 PM! The life times of the 26 Patriarchs add up to 12600 Years! More exactly, a Month is 27.321661 days, on average relative to the Stars, and 29.530589 days, on average relative to the Sun. 27.321661 days is also 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes 11.5 seconds, and there in those numbers is 27 then a 4 and then a 31 and then a 15. The 7 hours is also 25200 seconds, reminding me of the 2:52 PM! The 27 has a 321 next to it! 29.530589, can be rounded up to 29.531, and 29 is half of 58, and 531 is close to the 532 minutes past the 6 AM dawn! 29.531 days is 2551478 seconds, round up able to 255200 seconds, reminding me of 2:52 PM. In 31 AD, the tilt angle of the Earth was 23.691 Degrees, take away 23.439 Degrees the reference tilt angle of Astronomy, leaves 0.252 Degrees, like 2:52 PM! Google up Biblical Numerology, or more directly of these things Bible Numerics, God does exist, and wants you to find hints of that. Here are some recent years where there was more than 5 Eclipses, 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935, There is 2 central years of the cluster 1805 and 1823, after reflecting in a mirror from underneath 1805 and 1823, become 1802 and 1853, emphasising how 1/85, 1/58 and 3/58 is more likely to be important to God]"},{"instruction":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","output":"As a chairman I had to look after canteen.

China, however, has a rank just above India, at 3rd position. Now, coming to defense production, the main reasons why India seems to have lower defense production than China is the following, ● 1: Foreign Procurement contracts: Now, these contracts ensure that india gets military equipment from outsiders, instead of developing it on its own. In contrast however, there seem to be fewer such contracts that china seems to have. Whenever, India buys anything from another foreign nation, it discourages its own industry by implying that they are not capable of developing or creating whatever is being purchased. Let's take an example of the Dassault Rafale. 36 such jets were procured at a very high cost of 7.87 Billion Euro. I'm not saying that it was a bad deal, but , if HAL, say, were given even a fraction of that money as budget (787 million euro , say,), they would have been able to scale up the excellent Tejas to create a Rafale esque aircraft at a lower per unit cost, which would have been indigenous. Note: nobody would highlight this, but HAL is planning to do exactly this, with their planned HAL ORCA fighter, which is going to be a scaled up 2 engine variant of Tejas, this aircraft would likely be better than a rafale , at a cost that would benefit the Indian government. ●2 : Biased Media Attention : Indian media (especially, popular ones like Times of India and Hindustan Times), tend to show Indian made equipment as being of a lower quality and standard than foreign equipment. For example, the highly criticised INSAS rifle, which was a fully Indian rifle, like the tejas. These are the results you get when you search INSAS rifle review Who is scroll to make comments on such a rifle? Are they gonna make a new rifle for India? Do they have the capability or the brain to design firearms? TBH, most rifles being used in armies around the world, including China were designed in the 1980s, so INSAS was not behind on that. There are articles written by army servicemen on quora, which also high light this fact that, INSAS was an excellent rifle, whose image was maligned by media. I'll post links to these articles when I can find them again. ● 3: Middle men and Politicians : Indian democracy has been both an advantage and a disadvantage for Indian defense manufacturing. One thing that many people notice is the fact that whenever there is any news of something Indian being inducted in any part of the Indian military, suddenly, there are ‘experts' speaking out on it lambasting the so called ‘viability ‘ of this kit. What most indians don't understand is the fact that these so called experts actually are arms dealers, whose main aim is to earn money through any way, by selling shoddy equipment at high costs, etc. (Eg, look at lockheed Martin trying to pass off the 70's f16 fighter as a “5th gen” by linking it by name to the f22 and saying that its got stuff from the f35, F21 and, F16.) Also, why do politicians high light defense deals and call them corrupt? Eg, Rahul Ghandi calling Rafale deal corrupt. It is because the deals were not giving the politicians kickbacks, and this is not good from the politicians perspective India has a very good defense manufacturing industry, that is one of the most economical and most effective ones. There is very little corruption, and thus, it takes less money to develop interesting tech. Stuff like the HAL Tejas , and for eg, INS Kolkata, the first stealth destroyer of Indian navy, can be made at a low cost, with a higher quality standard than most of the world would offer at that price, China included. Therefore, I feel, India has a substantial Military complex, which is better in many terms than the Chinese one, but , what is holding the indian defense manufacturing back is the lack of funding and the negative image that the supposed ‘patriotic’ Indian paid media is giving it. (LOL- indian media is not patriotic, its anti india.)"},{"instruction":"it possible to have an English accent if you are not white?","output":"Colour and accent have no connection but it is usually true that children adopt their parents accent to a degree.

If Russia somehow dominated its immediate surroundings, that would just make a tiny elite very rich and everybody would have to pay for it, and they'd make more nuclear enemies, even India and China. The rich-poor divide would just get worse. Russia was never a colonial power, and it borders on Europe and China, and has long history of esrablished political-economic practices with these neighbours. It could not dominate China nor Japan or any of the European countries, which USA will hold on to for dear life as its colonies, pawns, attack dogs, buffers and in if it came down to it, hostages. Russia is just there, with its population, its unexportable culture, vast resources and plenty room for growth on the inside. If it can remain united and sovereign, that's more than enough. They can poke around in the Middle East, and that's about it. To move ahead and leave the New World Order in the dust, Russia would have to focus on how to make the most out of people's innovative power. Like a cultural revolution minus the intersectional divide-and-conquer rainbow feminism, white guilt and other stuff that appeals to an average american… Get green sustainable food and power, human rights and mental health (God knows Russia needs mental health). Trash that opioid or vodka crap. Contrary to what imbeciles would say, Cocacola and McDonalds were not a beneficial addition to Russia. It's just diabetes and prime real estate hogging. Skip the state-regulated GMO supercitizens and AI cameras-everywhere like China and London does. Also cannabis being illegal is a huge damper on progress. It's the hallmark of a chump country trying to fit in for the sake of fitting in. ‘USA and Mexico had a culture war one time, so now we call it Marijuana and pretend there is a shortage of fuel and prop up the oil, paper and legal drug industry, and the housing bubble and yeah, let's burn down the Amazon rainforest.’ Weed’s a green nuke that can’t be beat. If they made a weed-flavored soft drink, sold it with premade joints and some peanuts at gas stations it would be worse than night of the long knives on the West. On the other hand, once the Amazon is burned down, guess who still has megatons of forest. If India and China get overpopulated, guess who has land and water? Guess which federation was not founded on racial/nationalist genocide, is a multiethnic multireligious country with a history of tolerance, great mix of women's rights and conservative values and few if any mass shootings. And the crime and poverty, it just kind of sort of fits with Russia, probably makes people more tough. Most people were dead broke under the Tsar, dead broke under the Soviets, and they can take it even if it goes to shit. Russian is one of the least experimental cultures on Earth. That's ity strength (tried and tested) but also its weakness (predictable and boring). You gotta understand that if Russia took up international loans to fund western style ‘projects’, it would just enslave and indebt the people. They would pay 50€ more to drive a more expensive car to a hospital with better elevators to watch their grandma who had her veins raped by Skittles now get legal morphine. Wow, much impress comrade.

We'd meet on wednesday nights in the basement of the Boston Museum of Science. Most of the other members were snake-keepers like me, but my boa was a banana-crate hatchling, only two feet long (60 cm), while some of the others had adult Burmese pythons, reticulated pythons, etc.; some were fifteen to twenty feet long (5 to 6 m). “Banana crate boa\\" means the pet shop had probably bought the baby snake from a fresh fruit importer. Boxes of bananas sometimes arrive on the dock with baby boas nestled amongst the fruit, where they had hidden a couple weeks earlier, when the boxes were packed in Central America. I'd bought my little one for about 80. The reptile club was run by a Museum employee named Pete; he was the Museum's live-animal curator. The Museum ran live animal shows every two or three hours, showing kids a Great Horned Owl, a de-scented skunk, or a four foot alligator, that sort of thing. Little kids love it. Pete's job was to manage a few young staff who helped show the animals during the day, and cared for the animals at night. The Museum's menagerie was like a good sized pet-shop in its variety, except there weren't any kittens or goldfish. Pete was a very relaxed hippie, medium-height and slender, with straight, collar-length hair. He had a couple big snakes at home, 200-lb pythons, each nearly 20 ft long, and as big around as my leg. They were hard to move, so we never saw more than pictures of Pete's snakes. Pete told me a funny story one time, about the Musem's reticulated python. Retics are gorgeous animals, and this one was particularly so, with brilliant rhombus-shaped patches of iridescent blue-green, edged in black, separated by a net of narrow gold lines, with regularly-spaced flecks of bright white. The snake was nine feet long, and about as big across as a big zucchini. This picture is close, but it doesn't do justice to the Museum's retic: So, one Wednesday night, I told Pete a funny story about my little boa having bitten me while I was feeding her. He replied with a similar story of his own: “One night last year, I was a bit careless when I was feeding the retic. I'd thawed out a frozen rat, and I took it over to the cage, but then I got distracted and put it down on the counter. A little later, I opened the cage to feed the snake, but I'd forgotten to wash the rat's scent off my hands. The snake saw my warm hand in his cage, smelling like a rat, so Wham!, he bit my hand, and wouldn't let go. He was ready to eat. “We have an old chemical safety shower head in the animal room, I wanted to spray the snake down with cold water, get him to let go. But the shower was across the room, and with just one free hand, I couldn't lift the snake to carry it over there safely, without hurting it. I could reach the animal room's phone, so I tried calling a coworker to come help me carry the snake, but noone picked up, I had to just leave a message. “So, I sat down and smoked a cigarette, and waited for someone to show up and help. While I was waiting, the snake finished trying to squeeze my arm to death, and started swallowing my hand and forearm. My arm was kinda messy, when we eventually got him off of me.” Pete was so sanguine about it; after all, getting bitten is just part of living and working with big snakes. But it's not like a nine-foot python is no big deal. Years later, I met a woman whose nine-foot retic had bitten her three years before. That time, her snake had anchored its back half on its perch before striking. After grabbing her hand, the snake tried to spin her hand so as to wrap around it and kill it. The snake's move twisted the owner's arm so strongly and suddenly, as to tear muscles along her arm and into her upper back. She needed surgery to repair the damage, and physical therapy to recover the proper use of her arm. I learned from Pete’s story to take the same tone that he had. About ten years later, when my boa was about seven feet long, she bit me for the same reason: I had handled the food rat, then i carelessly opened the cage without washing my hands. Y'know, Wham!

My reasons being that 1) Its bizarre/outlandish. 2) I think the designs are badass and adorable. 3) It was created with the same intent marvel has always had: to relate to its readers. Usually I reserve judgement until I actually read the comic. But after seeing so many hateful reviews. I know we're all entitled to our opinions and that's fine but I personally think everyone is judging the book by its cover. Heres my review of the individual characters: Snowflake & Safespace I think the designs of the twins are cute, reminds me of an old shonen manga. Snowflake can make ice shurikens (I love elemental weapons) and Safespace can trigger pink shields to protect those he cares for. I don't know about everyone else but I'm getting some Steven Universe vibes from this. Now, people are pissed at the twins for two reasons: Poor representation of a Non-Binary individual and their “insulting” names. As a Pansexual Afro-American man, I can see what direction the writers were trying to go with Snowflake. Can it be done better? Yes. Is it a horrible idea overall? Definitely not. With a little improvements, People will come to love Snowflake. I already do. As for their names, here's a quote from Marvel's website: “it's this idea that these are terms that get thrown around on the internet that they see as derogatory. [They] take those words and kind of wear them as badges of honor.” I interpret this as an outside view of the fact that terms that have been seen as derogatory for centuries have now been used as “regular” terms for people of color. Where I grew up and in plenty of other places, the N-word is a commonly used form of slang not just by black people but also by Hispanics and some asians. It's gotten to a point where it's only ever seen as a racial slur depending on how its said. They also said on the marvel website that Snowflake used the name snowflake because they wanted to take word that's normally fragile and make it sharp. I like that. I find it cool. Screentime And here's the team's token techno-geek I find his design very futuristic, which is badass in my opinion. It's kinda like a cross between Ben 10's colors and Tron’s suit. He is described as a meme obsessed teen who loves the internet. I'm sure that ALOT of people can relate to that. I know I can (Not so much with the memes though) He gets his powers from his grandfather's “Internet Gas\\"….. I think everyone will agree with me when I say that's the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard. BUT, let's be fair, the same can be said for alot of fictional characters. Ridiculousness is apart of the charm for some people. Weird origin story aside, I believe people can learn to like this dude. His powers are internet based. His brain is connected to google and possibly other websites. Meaning his intellect will be off the charts. I see him as the hotshot of the group, who can build many over the top equipment for himself and the rest of the team. So with all that said, I look forward to his debut. Trailblazer Upon first seeing her, I thought she was supposed to be a Go Diego Go pastiche. I didnt have a problem with that because I loved that show when I was a kid. Some have given her character flak because she's not really unique. Or she's just an attempt to appeal to chunky people. I call bullshit. I mean, yeah, the “magic sack” trope is overused. But most of the time, people put unique spins on it. This is no different. A mystical backpack that was bestowed upon her by a currently unidentified deity. I can work with that. It adds a bit of mystery to her character. Like who is this deity? When did she get this backpack? Why was she chosen to have this item? These are legitimate questions that bring in readers. Also, she's on the thick side. Who doesn't love a plus-sized cutie? There's hints that she has confidence issues and is self-conscious about her weight. Being conscious about your looks is a common trait many young people, myself included, are known to possess. And what are marvel heroes known for again? I think Trailblazer is a cutie and a potentially inspirational character, if done right. If not by her current writers then by any aspiring writer, myself included, that's willing to take a chance on this sugarpie. B-Negative Just hearing his name is what got me thinking “90s Antihero\\". This boy is a vampiric emo who got his powers from a blood transfusion with Morbius. Being a fan of Morbius and Vampires is what earned this kid some cool points with me. I love his design, mostly because I love the gothic aesthetic. And I can relate him because like him, I'm a 2000s kid who loves rock or heavy metal music from the 90s. He's got the coolest and most direct origin story of the group. He seems to me like the type of character people write slash fanfictions about. So I definitely see him being a fan favourite. The thing about being a comic book writer/artist, it's about taking risks, testing your creativity on genres and subjects your not used to. And as an aspiring comic writer/artist myself, I try to expand my reach into different artstyles and mixing and mashing different genres. Is this team perfect? No. No superhero team is flawless. But is it utterly horrible? I dont think so."},{"instruction":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","output":"You live only once.

IMO there are many things. Some I’ve noticed since school and others since graduating. Just want to point out I largely adored college. It’s an interesting thing really to consider all of the different layers to his. The purpose of school is supposed to be getting an education. Not making friends or playing sports. Of course to most school-aged kids and teens care more about this stuff than learning. From the very beginning, you have cliques being built and kids are separated in social classes, so to speak. Some kids always wear new clothes considered in style and expensive. Other kids will wear handmedowns or cheaper clothes. Some kids have money for the extra line that has better food. The other kids will have to eat what’s being served. They’ll likely be denied things like sweet tea and ice cream, and sodas. Bullying is a big problem and getting worse. The school systen fails to understand how bullying damages mental health. It seems like you’re hearing about suicides all the time. Cyberbullying allows the bullying to continue when kids go home. I have seen teachers bully students also. They act like just they kids. Thanks to the social class above it opens up more things to bully kids about. Plus teachers have an annoying habbit of forcing bullied kids to do group projects with bullies who don’t like them. Both bully and bullied might protest but the teacher insists. More on that later. I would also say a lack to meet every kid's interest. While yes, most kids don’t like school and aren’t going to enjoy it. Other than sports there are clubs but they offer little. It’s only set up to give some kids an interest. Some kids either dont like sports or legit can’t play them. The clubs are usually filled with these same popular kids. The biggest laugh was a club that was supposed to allow students to help other students dealing with problems. It was funny, this club too was filled with the same popular people who bullied. A whole slew of kids have nothing exciting to do unless you like pep rallies. I always skipped them. Behaving as if every kids is a factory worker in the making. Kids have always dealt with this, so whatever. But you sit for six to eight hours doing work, staring at computers or textbooks. Then you go home and nearly every teacher assigns homework. Honestly, I would forget about homework a lot of the time and if it was math, I sucked at it and no one could help me. I made a lot of bad grades and I’m surprised I learned anything. My next thing is I truly believe there are some teachers out there who have a power trip and enjoy forcing kids to do things they don’t want to do. For others, they are trying to prepare you for the real world, so they think they're helping. However for the majority of kids with mental health issues, which so often happens because of school are further damaged by it. Mental Health isn’t as simple as getting over what you don’t like. Making them stand up in front of the class as you yell at them when they don’t understand what to do causes embarrassment. Placing them with their bullies ad shaming them. Making fun of them with other students. Making them read out loud when they have trouble reading or speech impedements. Morbid things children go through we find so normal we think little of. Good teachers are overworked and underpaid. They don’t have the recources it takes to do what they’d like to do. Things that really help the students. It’s very sad."},{"instruction":"Which is your favourite World Test Championship knock?","output":"The 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship was the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship of Test cricket. It started on 1 August 2019 with the first Test of the 2019 Ashes series and finished with the Final India Vs New Zealand at the Rose Bowl, Southampton in June 2021 win by New Zealand. There are a lot of innings is my favorite, like Rishab & Pujara Inning in the fourth test match vs Australia in Gaba, Brisbane test in 2021 chasing 328 runs in the fourth inning & win the match for India. Rohit Sharma inning 176 off 244 balls in Visakhapatnam test vs South Africa in Oct 2019 where the ball was swinging.

For England, it was a must-win game to alive in the ashes. Go to the 4th day of the third test match of the ashes started poorly for England. The first 25 balls were dots and the new ball was due to be available to Australia in another four overs. Root eventually opened the scoring for the day before being caught behind by Warner off Lyon's bowling, having made 77 runs. After that Bairstow joined Stokes at the crease with the score of 159/4 and the partnership made 79 runs before lunch to bring England to 238/4. However, soon after play resumed, England suffered a string of quick wickets. Bairstow was the first to fall and then collapse. Suddenly England with the score at 286/9 and Ben stroke and their spin bowler Jack Leach on the crease. Look like England going to lose the match. But Ben stroke has another plan. Stokes took the brunt of the Australian attack, never allowing Leach to face more than a final couple of balls of any over so that Stokes could keep the strike and the lone ranger Ben stroke chase the big score of 359 and win the match for England and also alive the ashes 2019."},{"instruction":"A Kaiser technician told me that potassium has no effect on mood whatsoever, is that true?","output":"“ If you're feeling anxious or upset, potassium and magnesium supplements can help you feel more calm and relaxed.

It helps to think of the academic papers written up to this point as 5k or 10k trainers for that 42k marathon that you are about to do. One of the fundamental rules of running a marathon is this: don’t do anything different on race day. Whatever methods you have found to be most successful, whatever has worked for you to get you to this point, continue to use it. Consider the following foolishness: there are perhaps dozens of various writing programs available. A curious young student uses MS Word but then a friend raves about about this great program called Mellel, which is excellent for handling long documents. But then they move on to to Scrivner (which really is the best for first drafts). But then they get curious about Latex. They keep moving around from one programme to the next, looking for the greatest experience in productivity. Does this all sound like a grand waste of time? Would it not have been more effective to have elected one programme and used that? Yes, it would have. The point is this: you have a very limited amount of time in which to complete your dissertation and you cannot waste any of it. Be committed to a process and do not give into the many gadgets and temptations. Writing a dissertation is like running a marathon in other ways, too. Mental and physical health matters, for instance. Many students start writing a dissertation with a complete and utter disregard for their mental and physical health. They feel that they are living the life of the mind and the vehicle that carries that brain of theirs around is not so important. They don’t exercise, eat terribly, drink heavily, smoke nervously, and so on. Bobby Fischer, one of the greatest chess players of all time, was all about brain. Yet he was also keen on exercise: tennis, swimming, running and so on. And he believed, rightly as science goes, that exercise complemented mental activity and ultimately made him a better player. So for your mental faculties to operate at their peak, you should get into and stay in shape. Writing the best dissertation possible can start with simple activities like long walks, or yoga in your pyjamas. Ultimately, however, it is the process that is most like a marathon. That long long long stretch of reading, researching, and writing. One of the biggest issues you will have to address is cohesion. How do you write five to ten chapters on a single subject? This is a challenge, especially if you only have a vague notion of how different aspects of your work will fit together. The worst thing, really, is thinking you know how it all fits together then setting out to [LINKED_TEXT: write the dissertation] [URL: https://www.premiumdissertation.co.uk/] only to discover that you did not see clearly at all. Before race day it is not uncommon for people to go over the course, either physically or with a map, conferring with team mates, advisors, trusted friends. It is, after all, good to know what may lay ahead. This is an effective strategy that can easily be incorporated into your dissertation marathon. First, there is your own advisor. Now in general, students writing a thesis are required to submit some sort of plan. This can be informal or formal, and will outline how they anticipate spending their time. This can be helpful, of course, and should be organized with the help of your advisor(s) or committee. Not uncommonly, however, these plans go out the window in the first several months. This is probably because the plan was made without actually looking at the course – the terrain to be covered. Before doing this, discuss with your advisor the possibility of a very heavy reading and research intensive first few months. Four or five months of focused and industrious reading in your area will give you the best idea of the ground to be covered. You'll have a clearer overview of what has been said, and what has been overlooked. You should read this way, honestly, like you have no opinions, no position of your own.

They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a source of fuel. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates: 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram; lipids, on the other hand, provide 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram. From a nutritional point of view, the most important aspect and defining the character of the protein is its amino acid composition. Proteins are protein chains composed of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Throughout human digestion, proteins are broken down by hydrochloric acid and protease into shorter polypeptide chains in the abdomen. Variety is the secret when selecting protein foods. Eating a wide range of healthy proteins gives your body other essential nutrients, including iron, zinc and other essential minerals and vitamins (especially B-group vitamins). Legumes (also known as pulses) include foods such as chickpeas, lentils and beans and are a high plant-based protein. Together with nuts and seeds, they can add non-animal proteins to your diet. Some people think that eggs are not healthy, which is not valid. They are a good source of protein. Dairy foods, such as low-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt, contain protein, but they are beneficial in their own right. Chicken Breast is one of the most common foods rich in protein. When you consume it without the fat, the bulk of the calories in it come from protein. Lean beef is very high in protein and also tastes delicious. Tuna is a prevalent type of fish.

Then he got a red nose pit bull as a second dog. This is what his Husky used to look like : And this is how his pit bull looks: Those are two very beautiful and powerful breed. The pit bull often gets a very bad rep. But they are amazing dogs! Anyway. My brother one day called me after I had babysat both of his dogs at the same time and asked me “Which dog would you keep if you were to make a choice?” and I replied “the pit bull”. Here’s why I answered that. It was a hot summer day and my little brother was coming to town for a business appointment and since he lived in the city at the time, he couldn’t leave his two very large dogs in his urban apartment so he brought them over to our mother’s home knowing I was there visiting and could take care of the dogs. He told me he would be gone for only 48 hours. Here is what happened in ONLY 48 hours : The husky dug huge giant holes in the backyard. HUGE HOLES.The husky kept biting and chewing the pit bull’s private parts. Yes you heard that right, he kept chewing on the pit’s penis to the point he had rash all over it. I saw him doing it with my own eyes and had to separate them for the pit’s sake.The husky broke his leash and escaped to the woods, THREE TIMES the same day. Mind you, the leash was hard metal.The husky also tried to encourage the pit bull to run away with him by breaking the pit’s leash BUT guess what? Every single time I went outside to check on them, the pit bull was standing still OFF LEASH like a good boy while the husky had ran away.The husky growled at my mother while she was trying to tie up his leash. My mother became so scared she never went outside while they were there. I was the only one interacting with both dogs. I guess they loved my bossy yet very calm and loving energy.My mother was so afraid of the husky after he growled at her, that I had to keep both dogs in my room with the door closed at night. The pit bull slept on the bed with me while the husky slept on the floor. Now, here’s what I’ve learned in 48 hours about Huskies : They can be very territorial and aggressive : If you have bad energy or are not very confident, huskies will walk all over you and assert their dominance.They are incredibly strong : Huskies can break metal chains easily. And they can also easily fight you. When I was walking the dogs, I felt how strong the husky was. I felt like he was walking me, not the other way around.They need a LOT of exercise or else they misbehave : This was my fault. I did not know this but once I discovered this, I went out of my way to provide the husky a lot of activities. He was surprisingly obedient on a leash when I would take him walk in the woods alongside the pit bull.They are extremely PLAYFUL and CURIOUS : They are as curious as cats! They want to know and see everything. Once I realized that, I created several detective games in which the dogs had to find hidden treats and toys. The pit bull wasn’t so much into it but the husky absolutely LOVED every single minute of it.They HATE being hot : Another mistake of mine. I did not know to what extent this was true because my little brother didn’t tell me anything. He just dropped his dogs leaving me to find out for myself. Because of their thick fur, Huskies dislikes heat and shades are not enough. They actually ADORE water! Lucky for me, at that time, we were living closed to a river. So I took both dogs out for a swim twice a day. It was like a paradise for him. Every time we arrived at the river, the husky would simply throw himself in the water and start diving and swimming like a mermaid. The pit bull would sit next to me enjoying the circus.They are VERY SMART : Having the husky with me felt like I was being studied. He basically mimicked everything I was doing. He would open doors, turn handles, pull chairs, etc. … It was sooo funny! Bottom line? Huskies are GREAT dogs! Beautiful and very funny! I LOVED every single minute of it. BUT, they are not for everyone! They require ALL your attention and they can be difficult to handle if you don’t understand their needs. And since my little brother lived in a small apartment and did not have a big yard at that time, that is why I suggested him to keep the pit instead of the husky when he asked me. My brother gave the husky to someone who lives on a farm with lots of land and a big river. He is the happiest of dogs now!"},{"instruction":"What’s the most important thing to know when you want to learn how to use a ham radio?","output":"Besides having an Elmer (a mentor to help you progress), knowing the basics of the power system, the grounding system, the antenna system, the radio to antenna system (COAX, or ladder line), the controls for the radio; would be the very basics. Add to that the rules and regulations regarding your radio class: From tech, General, Advanced to Extra the band plans, the type of emissions allowed on a particular frequency, the max power allowed at specific frequencies, the types of propagation: Line of sight, NVIS, D layer, E layer, F layer, Grey line, meteor scatter, moon bounce…….. Proper radio etiquette, courtesy, jargon, call signs from around the world……… For starters. I’ve been a ham operator for almost 40 years . It’s a learning experience…….you get out of it what you put into it. And a station doesn’t have to cost a fortune……. I started as a technician with a handy talkie. Back in the 1980’s we only had local or linked repeaters. My favourite was the Condor system. I could ‘hit’ the King City repeater from the high spot in my yard and chat with Hams all the way from Salinas CA to Dallas Texas with a HT and rubber duck antenna! Today, With that radio on 2 meters you can talk to other hams near and wide, even around the world via the internet linked: Alstar, Win-link, etc systems. So if your thing is strictly 2 meters(144MHz), or 70 CM (440Mhz) bands, a modest 100 will get you on the air.

Roe was overturned because Congress failed to make abortion a federal law, all rights belong to the states unless Congress passes a law that supersedes the state's rights. And they have to do it while conforming to the requirements of the Constitution. Leftists in Congress for decades have tried to avoid their responsibility and step up and own responsibility for their political views and rhetoric. They often try to pass off their job to the courts because it's easier to do and easier to hide behind. The courts correctly returned the responsibility to the States. It is their right and obligation to pass laws based don't the will of the people in that state. Again until Congress does its job and pass the laws its voters want then the state’s rights take precedence. Congress knows this, the media knows this.

Be Cool ! 20 LPA plus salary starting as a fresher with 6 LPA in the initial stage is a very good view. But…the focus target should be more for Professional development as an S/W Engineer not for accruing the mark of 20LPA + Salary while performing as a fresher with a 6 LPA salary. Note:-It is of course viable but not so soon without fulfilling any learning objectives and the needful experiences in the same or co-related area of work expertise. There are many cases duly depicted in the case studies as well as the practical aspects of the HR world, where the employee jumps in to acquire an abundance of Pay Packages but seldom gets stuck or demoted back to the original shape due to non-performance or under performances. So growth in Pay Packages is good but it should not hurt your professional Profile. Rather it should have proper correlations and effective equilibrium with your professional growth. So make acquiring Knowledge the main Construct, LPA is secondary as things will happen automatically. Sometimes more pay packages are offered for the fulfillment of a competitive behavioral output amongst employers and the employee becomes a scapegoat so as such you need to study the other aspects of Organisational Behaviour and professional ethics too. Please do remember good Organisational Behaviour outputs for learning and the fulfillment of Professional Objectives are always better than that a fast-track concept focusing on LPA/CPA/PP. It does not matter if the Organisation is a Startup/ Big Giant/ Branded or non-branded/ National or International. Fulfilling Learning Objectives, upgradation of knowledge and technology process, and accruing of the correlated good experiences is the only single objective for having a long-term goal or a vision accomplishment. Example: If an IT Company pay package maintains stability with 6 LPA as the initial stage of your professional career having normal progressive growth and does have good organizational Behaviour norms and provide you facilities for training, study opportunities to acquire more technical know-how and enhance knowledge, is better to have opted as your career instead of a company which offers a sudden growth in your pay package. Second to have good growth always be a part of an Action-oriented Company where your professional values, core competencies, and your output matter more to the company and not your physical presence. So run steadily not fast and fulfill your objectives to reach the landmark of 20 LPA + Salary or even more than that of your present objectives.

Akshay doesn’t believe in exercising in a set way as it becomes boring and monotonous, hence he is not a big fan of gyming. He believes in staying fit the natural way, along with following a strict and disciplined schedule. He loves making his work outs a lot more adventurous and fun by playing basketball, practicing kick-boxing, practicing yoga, swimming and lots of martial arts. He believes in not sticking to just one routine and try variations amidst nature. He does not work out for more than 45 minutes to one hour five to six times a week. Akshay Kumar has always shared that it is not just exercise, but also a healthy diet that keeps him fit. Here are some rules that he follows to stay in shape. 1. Never eat after 6:30 P.M.

Don’t believe in protein shakes, as it may have side effects in the long run. 3. Sleep early and start your morning as early as possible but don’t overexert your body. 4. Control your sugar and salt intake; the lesser you take, the healthier you are. 5. Try and meditate for at least half an hour, so as to get some peace of mind. Meditation also helps in reducing stress levels. 6. Always keep a container full of nuts and fruits with you. So, if you feel hungry, you know what to turn to. 7. Drink a lot of water; at least 4-5 liters daily. 8. Try keeping your metabolism rate high by eating healthy and half of your fitness and weight problems will be solved. Generally, he eats a bowl full of fresh fruits after his lunch and only eats green salads and soups for dinner as they are easy to digest. 9. Don’t overeat as you expand your stomach’s capacity to fill in more food. Try eating less that your gut gets used to small portions. 10.

My favorite is Captain John Brannigan, who over the course of three books (Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, Absolution Gap) becomes his ship — not through mind uploading, but through physical merging of his nervous system with the ship’s computers, then gradual whittling away of Captain Brannigan’s biological body and brain, until his consciousness exists only in these computers.

Although I know a lot about sports, I'm not an expert, so that's why I'm subscribed to their premium group. It is very important that when you have a sports betting broker like I do, that you listen to him disciplinedly on exactly which matches to bet on and with what stake. If you do that you will always be in profit, if you are in the Megalodon Telegram Group of course. So when they tell you that 4% of your total betting budget is placed on a bet, strictly place 4%, don't be lazy and place more. If you listen to them you will always be in profit."},{"instruction":"Why are dog toys colorful if dogs can’t see color?","output":"When the dogs themselves eventually earn enough money to buy their own toys, manufacturers will design them for dogs instead of people, who love color.

It’s that simple. If you cannot pay, we will take it back to the store. If you try to avoid payment with a bad check … and I saw this happen twice … you will be in trouble. One instance happened on post at Fort Benning. The other happened off post. In the latter case, the manager sent me with the police to identify the party who wrote the phony check; after which, he was under arrest and was taken downtown. The manager said that he was in court when the person was held without bail. I do not know what happened after that, but the best this person could expect would be to spend only thirty days in jail. In the former case, the manager called the soldier’s CO, who had the soldier personally give me the price of the pizza, in cash. I have no doubt the soldier was disciplined afterwards, though I do not know the details. I never had a customer blatantly take a pizza and refuse to pay. I can assure you that if someone had, I would have called the police on my own initiative and every manager I worked with would have backed me up. Pizza delivery drivers, depending on where they deliver, face potential violence. I was once robbed at gunpoint, and some of my co-workers could tell you similar stories. Every pizza company takes driver safety seriously. In every case where a driver was robbed or attacked in a given area, the response was always to suspend delivery to that area until further notice. What is stupid is that there is a way to (theoretically) get a free pizza. Call back and say that there was a hair on the pizza, or it tasted terrible, and you want a free pizza the next time. Managers are more likely to give you a free product than refund your money, because it costs the store less. Some managers are more likely to give in than others, but everywhere in the business, the customer is always right. If you really want to scam a free meal, that’s the way to do it, legally, and probably get away with it. If you run into a manager who isn’t falling for it, then the worst that could happen is that you don’t get a free pizza. The police won’t be called. You won’t be going to jail."},{"instruction":"Does an unused hard drive save data forever?","output":"Yes and no. It will store that data until the drive fails.

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"Well, 150 based on which scale? There are many scales like Stanford–Binet (SB) Wechsler, Bayley, Kauffman, et al., but since SB is the best/most regarded scale worldwide, and by me as well (for various reasons), I’ll set the context & my response based on SB scale, Edition-5 (SB-5). Yes, but it’s all relative. Here’s why: I’ve come to realize this over time by my cognitive reasoning, the ability to quickly derive solutions to complex life problems via pragmatic & data-driven decision making, along with many other things that >99% of the people in the world struggle to do, I can do this 90% better & faster than most in a heavy hangover state. Lol (After dating a lot of women across nationalities between 19–27), with no inclination of ever getting married (coz I never saw the value!), I decided who I want to grow old / spend the rest of my life with in less than a day, and after dating her for 2.8 yrs, we’re now married for 6.4 years!) This, along with a ton of other examples, exhibits a quality of being able to accept when you’re Prime-wrong (which unfortunately happens rarely, so it’s tricky for me differentiate!), change course quick (adapt) and stick to it. (Prime-wrong is my definition when I’m really Wrong/Off that comes through cognitive revelation mainly driven by external factors. But, because I possess a low IQ, I can be perceived to be wrong many times which I generally don’t care about, like when I call people out on their BS, or tell the truth which may offend someone, tell my best friend that there’s no need to be sad or cry his eyes out when his 92yr old grandpa died, instead celebrate his life instead of mourning his loss, and continue with her sisters wedding next month! Lol My poor EQ, does land me in trouble many times with family and close friends (I don’t have the aptitude, nor the interest to care about anyone else!), but they all know that my intent is to never hurt anyone, I just process information in a way not many can, and my solutions/response may seem crass, but it’s the right one. Per the SB-5 scale, anyone with a score of 145–160 is considered highly advanced/very gifted; I’m a 149.E.G: Elon Musk & Bill Gates are most definitely around 152 (+/- 3), which puts everyone in this bucket in the 99.945583088% (percentile), i.e. in the Top 0.05% of the global population. (99.9% of all PHDs & Neurosurgeons would come between 125–145) However, Einstein’s IQ of 160 is considered as a benchmark for measuring Genius IQs (i.e. A Person with an IQ of 160 or above is considered a Genius). But that was derived using a different / really old scale. Stephen Hawking (160) a genius, Rowan Atkinson, aka. Mr. Bean has a reported IQ of 178 and the fictional character of Sheldon Cooper is easily between 180–185 by my estimates. People in this bucket would be in the Top 0.001% of the global population. P.S.: I try my best to not offend anyone, so I tend to get into the detail of most things while explaining complex things to someone, mostly in a attempt to dumb it down (no offense) for others and give them more understanding, but I’ll gladly stop when told to without taking offense."},{"instruction":"w is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP if literally anyone can implement it?","output":"All that it guarantees is that the conversation between you and xyz.com is private. If xyz.com’s certificate is “trustworthy,” they paid someone (eg Verisign) to vouch for them as “really xyz.com.” If you’re going to xyz.com and you see the certificate for fubar.com… either the guy at xyz.com screwed it up or fubar.com can listen in on your conversation (which isn’t always bad; note that it changes to paypal’s certificate when you pay via paypal with some merchants, and see the next paragraph). I actually have my routers do this at work so I can listen in on the conversations so that the router can see that you’re being sent ransomware and stop it (so if you look at the certificate, it will say whereIwork.com instead of chase.com; and the users [me and coworkers] have to trust that I don’t really care [and I don’t] and that the router is good [afaik, it is]) — the router is acting as a man-in-the-middle attacker and will send the data securely onwards to chase.com so nobody else can read it). I really wish I didn’t have to do that, but the last 3 attempts were over SSL-connections to sites, so my router is the man-in-the-middle… OTOH, if it comes back as “self-signed”… well, you can be sure that nobody else can eavesdrop on your conversation, but you’re not exactly sure who you’re exactly talking to… (in my case, the router-in-the-middle-SSL certificate is self-signed… by the company domain controller, so it’s trusted). That being said… Franklin Veaux is quite correct — everybody knows how to make a lock (SSL connection). Due to the math involved, it’s harder (nigh-impossible) to “break” the lock like the lockpickinglawyer might do. On the 3rd hand… that secures your conversation, not your account. If somebody else knows your name and password, they can have their own conversation with www.chase.com and impersonate you and take your money… and their conversation is also secret (between them and chase). But at least nobody could “get your login” by “listening to your conversation with chase” (except for the man-in-the-middle attack above). So don’t expect SSL to keep “everything secret and secure.”"},{"instruction":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","output":"Businesses of all sizes are increasingly relying on mobile app development.

There is no such thing as right-wing Anarchism aside from internet fads. Anarchism has historically always been and will remain anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, anti-state and feminist. The recent internet fads of “Anarcho”-capitalists and other right-wing political trends are the result of co-option of Anarchist imagery, slogans etc by right-wing propagandists. Murray Rothbard infamously wrote about deliberately appropriating the term Libertarian as well, which has historically always been a synonym for Anarchist."},{"instruction":"Why is everyone leaving Florida and Texas and moving to California and New York?","output":"They're not.

I am a pediatric resident in New York, and not a day goes by without a child coming in to get a school excuse note. This is most common on Mondays or the day after holidays or long weekends (think New Year or Christmas). Sometimes parents make plans for long weekends and instruct their children to act a certain way so that they can get a school excuse note from us. Kids are usually so innocent that it's plain obvious once you see them. A kid with a pain score of 10 suddenly will start playing with the Nintendo Wii once it is in the vicinity (we have ChildLife providers to entertain the children who are admitted) and continue to say he/she has pain of 10. A child brought in for 12 episodes of vomiting at home will suddenly want the same ice cream their sibling was offered (usually by a smart nurse). Usually we send them back to school once they are ‘cured’ but we cannot paint everyone with the same brush. North American winters are brutal and a lot of people are without electricity at the moment. Sometimes we see chronic patients come in complaining of pain which I suspect has more to do with them not having food at home or indoor heating than their illness. Sometimes teenagers use the hospital as a means of getting away from abuse at home, and finding opportunity to seek help. It is hard to find a person's motive with just one evaluation so it is important to keep a broad mind without dismissing their claims and discharging them home."},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"I’d let her pick her own."},{"instruction":"Can you share some screenshots that deserves upvotes?","output":"What a engineer 🤣🤣🤣🤣"},{"instruction":"w is Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ racist? It is obviously sexist, but I cannot see racist undertones in it.","output":"“If” is not racist. Kipling himself was somewhat racist. As was the entire establishment of his day, and a good slice of the population. And as racists go, Kipling was one of the least bad. While he did consider that the British were the natural leaders of the world, he also attributed great worth to other groups. He saw the British as the officers in the army of humanity, and other races as the rankers. But he had huge respect for rankers, enlisted men in American terminology. He saw them, and by transference the non-white races, as the salt of the Earth. But nonetheless, subordinate to their officers, the British. And particularly the British upper classes. To single out Kipling as racist is deeply unfair, because he was less racist than at least 95% of his contemporaries. The world was racist then (and to some extent, still is). He was no worse than the vast majority of his contemporaries, and better than many. It was a century ago.

The problem is not on your side of the fence. It is on their side. You can perfectly lob your information ball over the fence, but they will either step aside and it never reaches them or they will get angry and smash the ball back at your head. You need to be realistic about what to expect. Here are a few of the usual things that people are hoping for when they decide to confront a Narcissist: Change: If I tell them how they hurt me, they will finally understand, and will change their behavior towards me in the future. Remorse: If they really understand how bad they treated me, they will feel remorse and apologize. Revenge: It will feel great to finally tell them off. Let them see how it feels to be criticized and have their self-esteem destroyed. Here are some of the responses that people who tell the Narcissistic person what they really feel get in response: Attacked: You are an idiot! Shut up! You want to hear what I really feel? Denial: You are making stuff up! That never happened. You are paranoid! Rejection: You are an ugly, piece of sh*t! No one will want you! I only f*cked you out of pity. Punchline: Unless you have something that the Narcissist in your life wants very badly, telling this person the truth about how badly they treated you is unlikely to have a satisfying outcome.

He gives his all, toils tirelessly only to see his crop sometimes fail due to his biggest strength & his biggest weakness : Nature. Add to that the blood sucking middlemen whose only motto is to mint money from the innocent farmers. The result: Heavy loans, increasing debts, financial stress, suicides. I once asked an old farmer going through a financial turmoil as to why he is continuing agriculture despite heavy financial losses. He said he could dream of doing nothing but agriculture. If he does not go to his field even for one single day, he feels empty inside. The simple feeling of being connected with nature and being the reason of feeding many people is what keeps him going. Their problems are aplenty. But, they always hope for a better tomorrow, a better next crop. From our side, minimal food wastage is the only tribute we can give to their hard work. Some startups helping them ditch the middle men and selling their crop on their own terms is a very positive sign.

I am 100% happy to recognize a fertilised egg - even before it has implanted itself in the uterus - as human. I am also 100% pro-choice. It comes down to bodily autonomy. Nobody can force a fetus to share it’s body or body parts to keep another human alive. It has the same legal right as any other human there. That includes women who are carrying that fetus. They ALSO have the right to bodily autonomy, which means they should not be forced to share their body, or body parts to keep another human alive. Regardless of the location of that other human. In the 1st trimester, when well over 90–95% of abortions are carried out, the fetus does not have a functioning brain. It has not yet developed sufficiently to have a brain. [Later term abortions are almost always wanted pregnancies where medical emergencies require an abortion to save the life of the woman or due to severe deformities that develop with the fetus that are incompatible with life; and, in a very small number of cases, due to women who have been denied access to an abortion much sooner.] In any other human, who is on life support but devoid of any brain activity, we consider them brain dead. Even if life support is keeping their heart pumping, oxygen pumping through their system and feeding nutrients into their body. The legal guardians of a brain dead human on life-support have the legal authority to remove life support. Fetuses who have zero brain/brain-activity, that are relying on the body of a woman to supply life-support should be treated no differently to any other human under the law. That is - until they have the same level of brain activity that any other human requires to be considered “independently alive”, their legal guardian (the woman carrying them) should have the same right to remove life-support; which is the use of her body. Otherwise, fetuses are being granted legal rights that no other human has. If we wish to apply full personhood to a fetus, then let’s at least be consistent."},{"instruction":"What is a visa provisioning service?","output":"The Visa Provisioning Service is directed at mobile network operators to facilitate NFC (near field communication) payments.

It is not something cool. You will realise it after a few years. I have had people around me doing it when I was in school and my only regret is not realising it earlier that it's not normal. Don't hurt yourself. Carving someone's name won't get you that person. Also emotional manipulation is not normal. So girls and boys, stop doing that. You are beautiful the way you are. You do not have to follow the social norms and their definition of beautiful. Having insecurities is normal. Learn to accept and love yourself. Things like alcohol and cigarette may tempt you but remember there is a reason behind people going to rehabilitation. If it really was helping people world would already a better place. Do not fall prey to all these addictions. Loyalty is important. That is something you should always remember. Nobody is ever criticized for being a gentleman or respecting a woman. Same applies for girls. Respect is earned not demanded. Don't make rash decisions. Give yourself time. And if there is something that your conscience doesn't allow, then don't do it. Don't do things just because they are in trend. Do things that you as a person really approve of. Stay happy. You are precious.

You cannot walk much without muscle pains on your legs and waist. You may walk only 100 meters and always start getting those pains… So you are in a way, immobilized. Some obesity sufferers need a supporting stick to walk or even trollei. When they have money they buy a car and go EVERYWHERE with it even if its 10 meters away…(im not kidding). Second, you have estranged all your relatives excep tthe ones who accept you for your current weight and understand /forgive you for getting this large. In my case they dont except my mother (mothers always forgive their childrens mistakes right?). SoI dont get invited to any family gatherings since I got obese. They dont want to see me at all. They dont visit me either. Zero contact for YEARS. Some of them have the nerve to say to me if they even see me thats my weight is why they dont ‘’accept me’’ anymore. :/ (for the record, im Greek). Third, social isolation in general. Its hard to date, go out and walk is very hard so you cannot meet someone for dating that involves walking usually. (I am not talking about one night stands here). And even if someone likes you and wants to date you you soon discover he is ‘’into BBW’’ and see you as a piece of object to use sexually. Of course this happens to non-BBW women too but its more obvious in our case. When I was not so fat, I did not know that normal and even good looking men, will want to date a very fat morbidly obese woman, sometimes years older than them, out of sexual fantasy. So having a normal steady and non-sex based REAL relationship (if not marriage) is almost impossible unless you accept that your other half actually (and pervertly) enjoys you being morbidly obese. There was a woman who did surgery (stomach cylinder) and became normal weight from obese, in Greece, and said on TV that her (normal weight) husband does not find her ‘’attractive’’ anymore :/ Fourth, being isolated and never invited out by anyone not even relatives, and having difficulty walking more than 50–100 meters, you tend to sit home and eat even more and get despair. You may get clinically depressive but its a challenge going to the doctors (you need car transfer if you dont own a car, or damn good local bus services). Fifth, you get obesity related health problems like gallbladder stones, kidney stones, (from consuming too much fast food products), a dead metabolic rate due to lack of exercise (metabolic syndrome) and a host of others. The human body was not designed by nature to hold so much fat in it. All this excess fat puts pressure on internal organs and causes a cascade of further ailments (im not a doctor but you can read about how morbid obesity leads even to death by googling it). Im morbidly obese right now ( 136 kilograms). I was always ‘’fat’’ (about 90 ,with height 1.70 m) but last 10 years I put on weight mindlessly due to personal problems/depression. Antidepressant drugs did not work in my case (I tried them with guidance by doctor, they didnt work). Food became my main ‘’drug’’. I am that is a ‘’substance abuser’’, I use food to confort my psychological problems. I already got a gallblader full of stones (cholesterol stones) due to rapid weight loss periods (yoyo diets). I cannot walk so im isolated. to my experience though when I am about 100 or 105 kilogram im still active and can take care of myself better, so my aim now is to lose weight to get at least to 105. At 105 I can shop for myself instead of ordering from internet food. I can cook instead of eating always fast foods ready to my door. I can clean my house better. I can walk about 2 km. My life wholly improves. And then there is of course room for improvement as 105 kilograms is still an obese person. But where I got now, I actually use support helpers (walking sticks) to walk and i avoid walking (whereas normally i enjoy walking outside), and on top of ALL the above when Im out of home I have to face with street harassment/comments by strangers for my body size."},{"instruction":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","output":"What?

Firehydrants are typically painted red (when I think of a fire hydrant, I think of a red one with a white top) but they can be painted different colours for different reasons depending on the local fire code. One reason is to indicate how much water can be pulled from the hydrant.. The colour that a hydrant is painted can tell a pump operator if he needs to get water from more than one hydrant to get the amount of water he needs. In the city of Vancouver, B.C, blue fire hydrants mean that you're able to get over 1500 gallons/minute from them. (pulled from the Vancouver website, “Red indicates < 500 Imperial Gallons Per Minute (GPM); Yellow indicates 500 - 1000 IMPERIAL GPM; Green indicates 1000 - 1500 IMPERIAL GPM; Blue indicates > 1500 IMPERIAL GPM; White indicates a PRIVATE HYDRANT”)"},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"This answer will concern a pizza place I worked at. A customer came in and ordered 2 slices of “garbage pizza”. I asked him if he meant our 'Everything slice' which has 3 meats-pepperoni, ground sausage, ground hamburger, and green peppers, onions, olives, mushrooms, and extra cheese on top. No. He said “ I've gotten this before, just write it down, they'll know…”. I've never heard of this and I've been working there for over a year, it's the middle of lunch rush but Sure! Let me just throw a wrench into this smooth process!. I'm not sure what to write as the order, so I asked the cooks. They looked confused. The gentleman said that Joel made it for him. So, I went to the back and asked my manager, Joel, to come to the front. So up he comes, and upon seeing the customer and hearing the request he smiled hugely and said “I got this.” He washes his hands & puts on an apron & gloves, jumps behind the line and starts layering ingredients on these slices. Now, our slices were large but this was a challenge! The finished slices contained: pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, green & black olives, spinach, fresh garlic, fresh tomatoes, broccoli, pineapple, banana peppers, jalapenos, ricotta, feta, and mozzarella cheeses, and for the final touch…a mix of iceberg & romaine lettuce! In to the oven it went, and a few minutes later out it came, smoking slightly more than normal, but we had a very happy customer!

Their wedding was fixed according to the Indian tradition of arranged marriage. Anagha was the niece of a family friend and was suggested to Arun's family as a prospective bride. The two families met at the friend's place and neither Arun nor Anagha had any misgivings left about meeting the right person at the right time. The twosome tied the knot on the auspicious day chosen by the family astrologer. The wedding was solemnised with pomp and gaiety! The couple shared perfect compatibility. Arun was a college professor and his job was respectable as well as remunerative. Soon, they could fulfill all their dreams and aspirations. They owned a bungalow and a car, maintained a decent lifestyle, were blessed with two sons and lived as a perfectly happy family. On weekdays, they would be busy in routine and weekends were meant for outings with friends, small excursions or cycling, swimming and sports. Everything was picture perfect. On one Saturday evening, Arun had a bash with his male friends and came home tipsy. But that was nothing unusual, as Anagha had taken his occasional boozing in stride. Reminding her to wake him up early the next morning, so that he could go swimming with his friends, Arun was already snoring within minutes of lying on the bed. The next morning, he got ready and called out to her from the drawing room that he was leaving. Anagha was busy in the kitchen. She took a few minutes to come out and on her entry in the drawing hall, saw Arun sprawled on the floor. She frantically called out for help. To her horror and the consternation of the entire family and friends, Arun was declared 'brought dead ' by the hospital staff. Life, suddenly came to a standstill. A numbness overtook Anagha's being. She had never learnt to be on her own without him. Her two boys, aged 13 and 5, clung to her all the time. They simply were at a loss to know what should come next. Life had to be lived, although, the shine from their existence had gone. After numberless days of uncontrollable wailing and mourning, one morning Anagha woke up to her stark reality. Her soulmate, her alter ego was gone forever, but had left behind two wonderful gifts in flesh and blood-her two sons. She could not ignore them for her husband who had left on the road of no return! z Turning down all propositions for remarriage, her sons became the sole purpose of her existence. Now, she has begun to live, believing that Arun is still with them and life is perfectly normal. He was her loving, loyal, selfless husband and would always have loved to see her living a life of dignity. She still wears her wedding necklace and sports a bindi on her forehead. Afterall, Arun is alive every moment- in her memory!"},{"instruction":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","output":"Emergency stopping has obviously been compromised.

What we do favor is the elimination of corporate federal income tax, since all of the costs of taxation are passed on to the eventual consumers. With no corporate income tax, there is more money to hire more employees, making more individual taxpayers. As for student loan “forgiveness,” you do realize that nothing is free. I am paying on my daughter’s loans (I cosigned and she refused to pay a penny), which are private loans. Why should I also have to pay for others, as a taxpayer, to have their debts transferred to me and to other taxpayers? If you cannot pay the loan, then skip college and go to a far less expensive trade school, so that you can find employment doing a trade that is necessary in today’s world. I find it sad that college graduates who major in useless subjects are working as baristas in Starbucks because their gender studies major isn’t worth anything."},{"instruction":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","output":"English is English - no need for British English!"},{"instruction":"Why are conservatives outraged when citizens get student loan relief, but are all for giant corporations being bailed out when they cannot repay their loans?","output":"Conservatives weren’t for Corporate bailouts, like for the automakers. However they tolerated them with a pinched nose as the bailout loans came with stipulations that they be paid back in full before a set date or else interest would start compiling on the amount and the Government would intervene in the operations of the business to ensure they got their money back. The automakers paid their loan back, so tax payers got their money back. Student loan relief is basically you taking out a loan paid for by the tax payer and then having it completely forgiven without ever having to repay it and get the tax payers their money back. Or to put it another way: Why should the tax payer pay for your education and you not be required to repay it just because you got a degree in a field that had no future employment opportunities?"},{"instruction":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","output":"i have whole playlist on bhutan travel tips do watch all the videos to find out how beautiful the country is and how to travel in budget and places to explore."},{"instruction":"Why is the book I Alone Can Fix It by Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker so controversial?","output":"It isn’t.

Most of the authentic or themed restaurants will empty your pockets and that irks me. Therefore when i found a restaurant that satisfies my taste buds and fits my budget also, i stuck to it! One of my favourite restaurants in Bangalore has to be The Rolling Pin, for two reasons!

Had Ezra seen Kanan death in that dimension, I have no doubts he would've warned Kanan about what he saw. Which might have helped them avoid that entire situation, that led to Kanan death. And even if Ezra wanted to undo Kanan death by going to that moment and save him, he had no way of doing that. Now, what I found interesting was how Kanan that never showed that much power in the Force, was not only able to hold off the explosion, heal his own eyes, but also push the ship away from the explosion. All at the same time!

They both represent the concept of a container for items grouped together. Back in the days when the main interface between humans and computers was all text based, files were organised into something called directories because it looked just like a (telephone) directory if you listed its contents. The old DOS command \\"dir\\" was just that: give me an (indexed) list of all things contained in the location specified. This would result in a text-based list of all the files present in the container/directory. Other operating systems like UNIX and Linux also have commands that remind us of the directory, e.g. \\"cd\\" (change directory). Modern human-computer interfaces are far more visually/graphically oriented and items/files on the computer system are often represented by icons. And, so, a better and more visually appealing representation for the container concept was introduced: the folder."},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"Look at your life 20 years from now and be honest with yourself while deciding whether you want to be the person you’re turning into.

I remember a slight change in body types. Previously a larger portion were huge/buff ‘wrestler-like' but a newer set were more, for lack of a better term, ‘normalish' but definitely a grade above my ability. Reason I was informed when politely inquiring was the sheer expense of all that extra physique. Those larger types were just awesome forces while the more ‘downsized' still very capable but just less in terms of energetic expense. Think Jesse Ventura former SEAL Office and the examples today.

The reason? Oversealous prosecutors. Say for example someone tries to mug me and I pull my gun. The mugger gets away because once he is no longer a threat, it no longer meets the criteria for a self defense shooting. But drawing your gun and not using it is called brandishing a weapon…and can get your weapon seized or worse. Not to mention looking at mug books trying to identify the mugger takes time. Most people will just figure they “dodged a bullet” and move on! update: The CDC was commissioned to study this very question and they determined the number of people using a gun to prevent a crime was between 60,000 and 2.5 million times each year.

His feats are the stuff worthy of a Tom Clancy novel and he was the thinly disguised model for the Bob Lee Swagger novels by Stephen Hunter. Some of his exploits defy belief. He once took four days to ingress to a shooting position with very little cover, kill the targeted enemy, (I cannot remember if it was a General or government official), and then escape. That feat alone would serve to elevate Hathcock, though there was much more. There was a sniper duel with “the Cobra” and another duel with “the Apache”. When Hathcock shot and killed the Cobra, he shot him right through the Cobras own scope. This of course meant the Cobra was aiming at Hathcock at the instant that Hathcock fired the fatal shot. If you have any interest in snipers, you should read his book, “Marine Sniper”. It is a travesty that Carlos never received a Medal of Honor, bur snipers in that time were…I lack the proper words, but they were not held in esteem for some reason. Forming my opinion based on the movie “American Sniper”, Kyle sometimes patrolled with his unit acting in more of a designated marksman role, and sometimes did overwatch for his unit by taking a position and killing any enemies seen or denying the area to them. I do not remember him doing any stalking but they fought different wars with different tactics. It would take a special warrior to be Kyle. It would take a very special warrior to be Hathcock.

For my own contribution I'm going to go for something more modern. I nominate something which is more of a class of related tales than a single story, which I'm going to call The Beast of <insert local wild area here> Said to roam unseen across the moors and country estates of England (and presumably Scotland and Wales as well), the Beast generally takes the form of a big cat, most often likened to a mountain lion or puma. The Beast is rarely seen directly, more often it is caught fleetingly in headlamp beams as someone drives home late at night. Never long enough for a positive Id and of course no pictures, but the myth is persistent. If you want to meet people who claim to have encountered The Beast, the best place I know is the ready room of a shooting club. Such clubs usually have at least a few hunters amongst the membership, and while most will scoff at the idea of big cats roaming undetected in England, you will find the odd one with a story to tell. I know one man who stalks deer on Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire, who absolutely swears he has seen footprints which could only have been left by something large and feline. Another tells of a hunting trip on a farm up on the ridgeway where they made a kill which they were unable to immediately take with them, and upon their return to collect the carcass they found it neatly eviscerated. They left in a hurry, no longer certain that they were the apex predators in the area. At home, inside, in the warm and the light, I doubt there are big cats at large in England. The myth has circulated for long enough that one should have been photographed, shot or just found dead of natural causes by now.

The future, I feel, isn’t all that “futuristic” for most… for some, the lucky few, it will be. For most on earth, the future will be a throwback to the past. A time machine that only goes backwards, rather than forwards. Kind of like how people live now in remote areas of the world. Only a little less happy, a little less smiling, less cheery. But darker, more bleak. A “return to nature” but one in which there’s a lot less nature around and the environment a lot more toxic.

They had a problem with cooling, despite the exposed cylinders. That was part of the reason that Rotary (spinning radial) engined were developed - because the cylinders were spinning, air cooling was very good - in fact it became too good, and you'll notice that some aircraft designs from WW1 had only the bottom third of the engine cowling being open to the cooling air so the engines were not overcooled. But rotaries have a serious flaw - the very large spinning mass of the engine created a serious problem when trying to turn the aircraft - it would turn very quickly in the direction of engine rotation, but extremely poorly against the engine rotation. In the rotary, inlet air and fuel have to be fed through the hollow fixed crankshaft, and the size of that crankshaft has practical limits. So rotary engines in service were limited to around 160hp and larger designs were found to be too unwieldy. That lead to a rethink in radial engines, where the engine stays still and the propellor is connected to a spinning crankshaft. With better head and valve design, the radial started becoming reliable, and Wright (after they bought the Lawrence company with its J1 radial) in the early 1920s started becoming very reliable and were tested at up to 300 hours before overhaul, when 50 hours was more the time for previous engines. Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight and a year later Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's (plus three other crew) first flight across the pacific, both using the Wright Whirlwind J5 engined confirmed the reliability of that style of engine. The US navy were very pleased with results like that, and decided that aircooled engines were the way to go for naval aviation so stopped buying water cooled engines completely, which of course spurred other manufacturers like Pratt and Whitney to Work on radial designs too. As others have said, the radial is simple in concept, and easy to enlarge in many respects. You can start with 3 or 5 cylinders, and using the same sized cylinders, increase it to 7 then 9 cylinders for more power. Although the crankshaft and other parts must increase in strength, a lot of development cost is saved in using a common cylinder/head/valve size. From 9 cylinders you can then drop back to 7 but add a second row for 14 cylinders, and then go back to 9 with two rows for 18 cylinders. So your engine can increase from say 400 hp to 1200 hp without having to redesign the cylinders or heads. A nest of different engines with some common parts is a very effective way of building engines. However, there is a practical limit on how big you can make each cylinder using just one intake and one exhaust valve. And all radials, due to their design, have only two valves. That size is roughly 6 inches bore and 6 inches stroke - about 2.5–2.6 liters per cylinder. So to get more power, designers use more cylinders. The largest radial ever built in any numbers was the PW4360 with 28 cylinders - 4 rows of 7 cylinders. But adding more rows means problems with cooling as the rear cylinders (even though offset) are partly masked by the front rows. And imagine when it comes time to change the sparks plugs - 56 per engine! So maintenance costs start to skyrocket, just because of the increasing complexity. Of course the jet age ended the era of piston engines for large aircraft, though there are still plenty of examples of old large radial aircraft still flying, and the piston engine still suits small aircraft better than turbine engines - turbines start to make economic sense at roughly 500hp."},{"instruction":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","output":"What a stupid question, and a lie.

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

In potentially heated situations they remain calm. As you learn about their lives, you will find they lived through difficulties.

He has subsequently become known for anti-vaccination activism. Publicity around the 1998 study caused a sharp decline in vaccination uptake, leading to a number of outbreaks of measles around the world. He was a surgeon on the liver transplant programme at the Royal Free Hospital in London and became senior lecturer and honorary consultant in experimental gastroenterology at the Royal Free and University College School of Medicine . He resigned from his positions there in 2001, \\"by mutual agreement\\", then moved to the United States. In 2004, Wakefield co-founded and began working at the Thoughtful House research center (now renamed Johnson Center for Child Health and Development) in Austin, Texas, serving as executive director there until February 2010, when he resigned in the wake of findings against him by the British General Medical Council . Wakefield published his 1998 paper on autism in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet , claiming to have identified a novel form of enterocolitis linked to autism. However, other researchers were unable to reproduce his findings, [7] [8] and a 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part. [9] Wakefield reportedly stood to earn up to 43 million per year selling test kits. [10] Most of Wakefield's co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations, [11] and the General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues, [12] focusing on Deer's findings. [13] In 2010, the GMC found that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research, had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children, [14] and had \\"failed in his duties as a responsible consultant\\". [15] [16] [17] The Lancet fully retracted Wakefield's 1998 publication on the basis of the GMC's findings, noting that elements of the manuscript had been falsified and that the journal had been \\"deceived\\" by Wakefield. [18] [19] Three months later, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register , in part for his deliberate falsification of research published in The Lancet , [20] and was barred from practising medicine in the UK. [21] In a related legal decision, a British court held that \\"[t]here is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Wakefield's] hypothesis, that MMR vaccine and autism/enterocolitis are causally linked\\".

Wakefield was (past tense emphasised) a gastroenterologist and biomedical researcher. He gained international fame when, in 1998, he published a paper in The Lancet which established (or at least, claimed to establish) a link between the MMR vaccine, and a rise in bowel disease and autism (interestingly — only 12 children were in the study, and eight of them supposedly developed behavioural disorders. That’s an insanely small test group, and an absurdly high rate: if this data were true, over 20 million people would have been made autistic by MMR before 1998) We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers Yep — this guy is the origin of the modern anti-vaccination movement (“antivaxxers”). Though the paper itself does not concretely blame MMR for the autism cases, Wakefield himself did several press conferences where he publicly claimed a causal link. This caused an uproar in the scientific community — and was labelled as “science by press conference”. It was these press conferences (not the actual paper itself, though people used the paper as a post-hoc justification) that led to a huge resurgence of the anti-vaccination movement, and the outcry over vaccination of children. Information then slowly began to leak out that all was not as it seemed to be with the paper, either. Several of the families in the study were approached by a lawyer preparing a lawsuit against the firms making the MMR jab. Huh…that would seem to be a conflict of interest, right? That is pretty dodgy. Then it was revealed that said lawyers had paid Wakefield more than £400,000 (700,000), which he had failed to disclose. This seriously raised questions about Wakefield’s motives: how can you expect a paper published by somebody funded by people suing the MMR vaccine makers to be impartial about the MMR vaccine? In light of the conflict of interest this represented, The Lancet re-reviewed the paper, and found that it no longer satisfied them as a piece of genuine research — and they issued to following retraction: We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between (the) vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised, and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent. Then, in 2004 it was revealed that, prior to publishing the 1998 paper, Wakefield had applied for a patent for a replacement for the MMR vaccine a mere few months before he began the 1998 paper which supposedly showed that the vaccine was unsafe! No way that could possibly have influenced his conclusions in the paper, right? Oh — you think that’s it? No, this story just keeps on going! After this, a former student came forward and said that Wakefield routinely ignored laboratory data. All this while, independent studies were utterly failing to reproduce the original results , and several of them called into question Wakefield’s research methods. In 2007, the UK General Medical Council initiated proceedings against Wakefield on the charges of : * \\"Was being paid to conduct the study by solicitors representing parents who believed their children had been harmed by MMR\\". * Ordered investigations \\"without the requisite paediatric qualifications\\" including colonoscopies, colon biopsies and lumbar punctures (\\"spinal taps\\") on his research subjects without the approval of his department's ethics board and contrary to the children's clinical interests, when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history. * \\"Act[ed] 'dishonestly and irresponsibly' in failing to disclose ... how patients were recruited for the study\\". * \\"Conduct[ed] the study on a basis not approved by the hospital's ethics committee.\\" * Purchased blood samples—for £5 each—from children present at his son's birthday party, which Wakefield joked about in a later presentation. * \\"[S]howed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer The GMC ruled in favour of all charges — and Wakefield was struck from the register (the harshest thing the GMC is able to do). During this trial Brian Deer (who had previously worked to uncover many of the inconsistencies in Wakefield’s work), discovered evidence that not only had there been poor lab practices, but that data had been willfully manipulated — and highlighted the difference between the hospital records of the 1998 data, and the data published in the paper, which appeared to show significant manipulation. OH MY GOD THERE’S STILL MORE THEN it was revealed that the father of one of the children in the 1998 study owned a patent that would profit from the MMR/autism scare , and that Wakefield himself predicted that they could “make more than 43 million a year from diagnostic kits” , where “the initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield]”. In light of this, The Lancet then re-retracted the initial paper — rather than just the edited conclusion I quoted above, they said: \\"The claims in the original paper that children were 'consecutively referred' and that investigations were 'approved' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false.\\" This was followed by a flurry of other retractions of Wakefield’s papers — many of which sought to establish a link between vaccination and illnesses. Seems like a happy ending, no? He got his comeuppance — and the community has rejected his ideas after a rigorous peer review process. Exactly how science is meant to work, right? Whilst the scientific community was busy giving Wakefield’s 1998 report a jolly good rogering — there was a human cost. You see, the everyday population doesn’t really pay attention to the proceeds of the UKGMC — and nor do they study the retractions in medical journals. But when a man in a lab coat stands up and says “VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM!” — that, they pay attention to. Since 1998, there has been a huge rise in the so called “antivaxxer” movement — who believe the claims of Wakefield . Several famous people have come out in support of the movement, including Jenny McCarthy (I’m not even going to cite this), and Jim Carrey , to name just two. This scare has led to huge numbers of children to be going unvaccinated, which compromises herd immunity , and has led to a staggering number of children to die from diseases they would have been safe from had they been vaccinated. I can’t 100% vouch for the methods of this website (though they certainly have a lot of primary sources from the CDC , which is promising), which has a running count of the number of preventable illnesses (in the US) and preventable deaths caused by non-vaccination. The current total stands at 152,763 preventable illnesses, and 9028 deaths. Let’s just repeat that. 9028 people have died (mostly children) because of the antivaccination movement. That website also contains a helpful counter for the “number of autism diagnoses linked to vaccination”. Guess what that number stands at? 0. Zero. Nada. Zilch. Normally I would avoid making potentially libellous statements such as this — but given that I have extensive back-up sources, citations — and also the fact that this has been tested in court several times (Wakefield has never won a libel suit), I therefore feel pretty darned confident in asserting: Andrew Wakefield is the most corrupt scientist in history. He can be held accountable for the deaths of nearly 10,000 human beings, because of his fraudulent and unethical research. He did this out of a desire to make a profit — and in doing so he compromised everything a scientist, and indeed a human being, should stand for. Sue me. I dare you.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-most-corrupt-and-crooked-scientist-ever-known/answer/Jack-Fraser-Govil?ch=10&oid=55741667&share=4c5a7403&srid=knPRc&target_type=answer]"},{"instruction":"w should western countries treat citizens who leave to join ISIS and then want to come back?","output":"Sign up to an ideology like that means you must be a latent psychopath, render service to it! you should be put down.

In particular, March, April, October and November are especially busy. If you're considering visiting during these months, it's best to book your tour package and flight tickets at least 3 months ahead to ensure your reservation. Back in 2010, Drukair tickets were sold out for 3 consecutive weeks, so to avoid disappointment, we'd advise you to plan ahead. More tourists tend to travel during this period as they are the ideal months for festivals and trekking, which are naturally big draws. If you want to avoid the crowd of the peak tourist period, consider travelling during the non-peak period. Cost difference between peak & non-peak periods During the peak tourist seasons of March - May and September - November, the daily tariff costs US250 per day. For the non-peak season of December - February and June - August, the daily tariff is US200 per day. If you want to travel to Bhutan but have a tight(er) budget, plan your trip during the off-peak months. Surcharge for groups of 2 travellers or less Travellers intending to go alone or as a pair should take note of the daily surcharge as follows: Single traveller - US40 per nightGroup of 2 travellers - US30 per person/per nightGroup of 3 travellers or more - No surcharge (so gather 2 of your friends along, save some money and form lasting memories!) Know the seasons It really depends on what you want to see and do. If you want to trek, April, May, September and October are the best months with optimum weather. Although it is colder, the skies are generally clear and blue, and most importantly, it won't be muddy. Do note that the monsoon season in Bhutan is from July - August and during this time, light rain (1-2 hours) in the morning is typical. Heavy downpours are rare, but we generally do not recommend trekking, unless they are short day hikes. Winter is a good time to catch the endangered black necked crane in their winter home, the Phobjika valley and summer is a wonderful time for mushroom picking (there's even a Matsutake Mushroom Festival) and to catch glimpses of (sometimes double) rainbows over the valleys. If you're there to seek solace or for spirituality reasons, anytime would be a good time to go. Time your arrival during a festival There are numerous festivals occurring throughout the year in Bhutan, though the popular ones such as the Paro and Thimphu Tshechu happen during the high tourist season. Festivals in Bhutan usually showcase colourful dances in elaborate costumes, with Bhutanese in attendance dressed to their best and unsurprisingly, tend to be huge tourist draws. Apart from religious festivals, there are a range of other festivals catering to other interests, such as the Rhododendron Festival, Black Necked Crane Festival, Royal Highlander Festival, Ura Matsusake Mushroom Festival and Haa Summer Festival, to name a few. If you're looking for a more intimate experience, consider going for a lesser known festival. *Friendly tip* These tend to provide better photo taking opportunities. Consider a home stay To be frank, this suggestion is often met with mixed response. Given the amount of money spent on the trip, many travellers want to unwind in the comfort of a hotel room. Others however, love the authenticity of staying with a local family and having the firsthand experience of what daily life is to a Bhutanese. Some things to take note of if you're seriously considering this option: while some families have modern facilities, not all families have electricity or a hot shower - they may have to boil the water using firewood. What they lack in facilities however, they'll more than make up for with unparalleled hospitality. End it in luxury In Bhutan, much of your time will be spent in the car travelling from valley to valley and destination to destination. After driving through this beautiful country and possibly experiencing a homestay with a local family, consider ending your trip with a pampering, luxurious stay in a 5-star accommodation such as Uma Paro (where actors Tony Leung and Carina Lau got married) with their complimentary yoga sessions overlooking the charming Paro valley. Choose from their range of other holistic wellness programmes such as guided meditation, ayurvedic therapies or pampering massages.

As a frequent rescuer of cats ( they come to me) can vouch exactly why they come? Contrary to popular belief, cats are not independent free spirits, but ( in my experience) social & enjoy being a valued part of a family as much as dogs & other animals. Proof of this? Whenever I call a cat which is outside, it always answers my call. Cats I have rescued tend to be neglected, some severely so. Very thin & emaciated. Coats very course, matted & unhealthy. More often than not, they have health issues arising from neglect. Never rescued a neutered or chipped cat. There is a popular belief that domestic cats can live independently, relying on hunting to survive. A typical 'abandoned' cat will at most survive around 4–6 weeks in the wild. One cat that came to me in a pitiful state I thought was a small kitten. After getting him sorted at vets & lots TLC, post - recovery, grew to twice his size. Gave him to a good friend who has been the perfect family. Five years on he is four times the size when he first came to me. A healthy lean whopping big cat. But, though I see him often, it has taken him four of his five years to bond with his new family. Terrified of men in black trousers & black shoes. Same man in jeans & brown shoes: he wants to groom them. Domestic cats are social, want & need to be a valued part of a human family. Only ever rescued one feral cat. She was coping ok in the wild hunting for food. Fed her, took her in, though she needed grooming, necessitated me wearing a face screen & welding gloves. The vet refused to examine her without her being anaesthetised first. Despite my efforts to domestics her feeding habits, she still prefered to hunt for food, evidenced by the rat tails in the garden. Brought home a rabbit on one occasion. Never did work out how she managed to get it through the conservatory door cat flap. Poor thing was dead before I could rescue it. She grew very fond of me & I her. Wherever I was in the garden, she was only ever just a couple of yards behind. 13 glorious love filled years we had together."},{"instruction":"What are good and reasonably priced places to stay in Cologne?

Even after restrictions are lifted and life returns to some semblance of normalcy, it's likely that many of us will still feel leery about attending large in-person events. This means that virtual events are here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. There will definitely be a demand for virtual events after covid. People have become accustomed to attending events online and having the convenience of not having to travel. Hybrid events (events that are both live and online) will also be popular as they offer the best of both worlds - the personal connection of a live event with the reach of an online audience. Some popular types of virtual events that we foresee being in demand are: -Virtual conferences -Virtual workshops and seminars -Virtual meetups and networking events -Virtual product launches -Virtual trade shows and expositions -and more! Hybrid events will be new reality of the future? Virtual events have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they offer a convenient and cost-effective way to connect with people from all over the world. However, some people worry that Virtual events lack the personal touch of face-to-face interactions. Hybrid events offer the best of both worlds by combining Virtual and live elements. For example, MultiTv's Virtual Events platform allows attendees to interact with each other in real time, even if they're located in different parts of the world. And for those who prefer a more personal touch, hybrid events also allow for meetups and networking opportunities. Whether you're looking to launch a new product or simply connect with like-minded individuals, hybrid events offer a unique and powerful way to do it. What kind of technology stack would you need to run hybrid events? The technology you need for running hybrid events really depends on the event itself and what kind of activities will be taking place. For example, if you're running a conference with keynote speeches and breakout sessions, you'll need audio/visual equipment for both in-person and virtual attendees. You'll also need a way to stream the event online and record it for future viewing. If your hybrid event is more like a training or workshop, you'll need technology that allows people to participate in interactive activities whether they're in the same room or not. This could include things like real-time polling, chat features, Q&A functionality, and so on. There are a few different technology stacks you could use to run hybrid events. Here are some of the most popular options: Event management software: This type of software is designed to help you plan, execute, and manage all aspects of your event. It can be used for both in-person and online events.Web conferencing software: This type of software allows you to host virtual meetings, webinars, and other types of online events.Streaming software: This type of software allows you to broadcast your event live online. It can be used for both in-person and online events. Each of these technology stacks has its own advantages and disadvantages. Technology company such as MultiTv offers an end to end solution, as an event organizer you don't have to worry about the technology or backend. Their solution comes embedded with everything and offers some unique advantages 1. Its integrated, you don't have to worry about how different parts work together 2. Quality and uninterrupted live stream from multiple breakout sessions. 3. Asynchronous coordination with in person and live audience 4. High quality recording and post production, option to distribute content after the event.

The league is played annually over a period of approximately two months, usually from March to May, with each team playing a total of 14 matches in a round-robin format. The top four teams at the end of the league stage qualify for the playoffs, which culminates in the IPL final. The IPL has become known for its high-intensity cricket, colorful atmosphere, and celebrity involvement, with many Bollywood stars and business tycoons owning teams in the league. The tournament has also been associated with controversy, including match-fixing scandals and disciplinary issues involving players and team owners.

You don't have to worry about being judged. You can speak your heart out. You can share your problems. There is no jealousy, no bad intention, no backstabbing. A real friend, a true friend, is someone who motivates and encourages you, who gets happy when you achieve something, who tells you the truth, who corrects you, who will always be at your side, who really listens to you, who wants good things for you and who is trustworthy. Your real friends will be on your priority list. You don't have to talk to the other person daily to maintain the friendship.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"The question is interesting. The State of Missouri has indeed gone ahead with its plans. HB 85, signed by Governor Mike Parson one year ago this week, is known as the Second Amendment Preservation Act. It forbids local and state law enforcement agencies from assisting federal agencies if those federal agencies seek to enforce weapons law or regulatory powers prohibited to the federal government by the Constitution. It also establishes fines to be levied against state agencies of up to 50,000 per officer for each violation of the constitutional rights of any Missouri citizen during a federal/state joint operation. Much has been made by leftist mainstream media of the new Missouri law, with almost all its coverage evincing a sneering contempt for the state’s purported claim that its law(s) supercede those of the federal government. SAPA does no such thing. It seeks instead to reestablish the proper balance of powers expressly provided for in the Constitution, powers that have continuously been encroached upon and usurped by the federal government over time. In the main, a constitutional federal law supercedes that of any State; by extension, any state merely ‘voiding’ federal laws would have no legal basis to do so. What should the remedy be, however, when a federal agency enforces laws under powers claimed, yet not granted, by the Constitution? All powers granted to the Congress, the Federal Courts, and the Executive branch by the U.S. Constitution are specified, and many of these grants allow for broad discretion by the Congress. In all other matters, however, any power not specifically granted the federal government is by default assigned to the States. These powers are in addition guaranteed by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, respectively. The concern of SAPA is for those areas of responsibility increasingly being taken from the States and illegally absorbed by the federal government in direct violation of the Constitution. Of the Missouri state rules, laws, and regulations regarding weapons possession and use, none conflict with any properly enacted federal statute. Given the federal threats to override state laws with its own prohibited replacements, the Missouri Legislature has enacted SAPA to legally reassert its dominion in properly designated areas. In a not-unexpected development the federal government, instead of abiding within the American constitutional framework, proposed to sue the state of Missouri instead. In February 2022 it did so, strangely claiming that the State of Missouri usurped ITS powers. News media in the United States has devolved over several decades to where its self-assigned role is now purely as adjunct to the Democratic Party; to call it a propaganda arm for the Democrats’ leftist agenda is neither harsh nor inaccurate. It refuses to cover many developments at all that fail to conform to its ‘progressive’ narrative. When it does report on a timely subject, only a heavily slanted angle is offered to the public, and this official version is in turn chanted, time and time and time again, until the average citizen can only nod and numbly repeat the commanded message. In the case of SAPA, what goes unsaid is that the State of Missouri not only poses a proper constitutional question, but may well be entirely correct in its argument. Under proposals by the Biden Administration, examples of potentially conflicting areas may include, but are not limited to, the following: No age restriction exists under Missouri law for open-carry of firearms; this allows the young to hunt with adults, free from prosecution. Federal officials want to prevent this until age twenty-one, although the legal age of suffrage is eighteen in the United States;Certain weapons will be forbidden from purchase by anyone younger than twenty-one, again in defiance of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment;Gun registration has but one logical purpose and no other - to enable location of those guns to facilitate their confiscation. There is no requirement for firearm registration in the State of Missouri, and federal law itself specifically forbids the creation and maintenance of data bases which compile or aggregate ownership information. SAPA would forbid federal agencies from demanding such information anyway from firearm dealers, as well as forbidding assistance for such schemes by local and state law enforcement agencies;Missouri has no state ‘red-flag’ laws, due to their inherent destruction of due process guarantees within the Constitution. As this is written, such laws are forming in Congress however, despite court rulings that the practice cannot be reconciled with a free people. The same objections hold for the so-called ‘boyfriend loophole’ which, again, would remove legal protections without any charge or conviction, all on the mere basis of any anonymous complaint.Finally (for me, anyway; I’m beat), there are those who hold that SAPA is improperly preemptive, that Missouri should await the outcome of subsequent court rulings on these matters only as they come up organically, and that enactment now is merely voiding federal laws without sanctioning by the courts. Not so, says Missouri. Article Six of the Constitution expressly encourages the demeanour adopted by Missouri, that illegal enactments by the federal government need not be honored until the day that slow-rolling justice catches up. Thomas Jefferson himself would prescribe just such a preemption of any tyrannical activity imposed by the federal government upon the Several States. This aggressive approach, embarked upon by the State of Missouri some years ago, is to be lauded as a proper, and long overdue, step toward renewing the promise of freedom for all Americans, not just the citizens of Missouri. May God grant that the work of Governor Parson and State Attorney General Eric Schmidt bear fruit yet again, work which benefits every citizen in the United States. I pity the young in this country (and our foreign critics). Never permitted an unprogrammed thought of their own, they yet evince loud, constant, poorly considered and badly worded objections to the presence of free people in their midst. I am proud to be a citizen of this land, born and raised with fight and freedom in the blood. We will win this thing. May God bless the Sovereign State of Missouri."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"At 13, I can still pretty much guilt my daughter into eating anything (corn, carrots, veggies, by giving them a sweet, little voice and having them beg to be eaten because it’s all they ever wanted in their life or to keep the family together because she already ate their cousins..

Of the seven independent organizations who provided their expert opinions, three were later to be found to be fronts for Armenian groups that support the Dashnaks. 4. The Special Rapporteur (Whitaker) who snuck in the footnote later admitted that he had been retained by the Armenian lobby, but that he did not receive any money for his report. However, he later did work for the Armenian lobby for money.

Terrible Barbarities. Constantinople, Sunday. The following telegram was received to-day by the Porte from Veli? : — On August 6th several thousand Armenian agitators crossed the frontier from Persia and attacked the Mizriki tribe, killing about two hundred persons, among whom were women and children. They further put the wife of the chief of the tribe to the most cruel death, and cut off the noses of several others of their victims. It is officially declared that the necessary precautions have been taken by the Imperial authorities not only to capture these marauders, but also to provide against eventualities in the vilayet of Van. The Ottoman Government has also requested the Persian Government to arrest these criminal bands, who on being pursued by Turkish troops may attempt to recross the frontier. The Persian Government is also urged to take proper measures for preventing in future these incursions of Armenian revolutionaries into Turkish territory. — Reuter, From The Bristol Times And Mirror, September 9, 1897: THE RECENT ARMENIAN RAID. TEHERAN, TUESDAY. A prolonged inquiry has just been concluded by the Persian authorities regarding the Armenian raid on the Turco-Persian frontiers last month, which was followed by serious fighting between Armenians and Kurds, with heavy losses on both sides. The result of the inquiry shows that the bulk of the raiders were from Turkish territory, and that fewer than 300 came from Persia. Nine villages were sacked, and there were massacred over 300 Mussulmans and Christians, including women and children. Twenty-nine of the ringleaders have been arrested, and handed over to the authorities to be dealt with. — Reuter. Native American Indian massacres. by deathbycheeseJan 12 2015 Native American Indian massacres. American Native women hung on crosses. So many Natives died and suffered many cruel deaths, sometimes there would be fields full of Natives on crosses that you could not count them, almost as if they were the Forrest themselves. This was done for hundreds of years by the Spaniards as they practiced extensive use of torture, murder, and mutilation against the Natives. These cruelties were designed to be extraordinary cruel so that Natives would not think or look at them selves to be human. Many languages and tribes became extinct, almost wiping out the Native nation leaving very few behind to die from other causes such as disease and starvation.

(by Ela Nur, lives in Turkey) Greek writer-journalist Tasos Kostopoulos, in his book “War and Ethnic Cleaning of 1912-1922′’, revealed the murders made by Greek soldiers in Anatolia. The writer said about the book: ‘’But I have to say this. I wrote this book with a focus only on the violence of the Greek army and the mistakes of politicians. I tried to show that it was no different from the violence that we were facing. That is, whether it be Turkish, Bulgarian or Serbian. I wanted to remind you that official history should be impartial. I believe that sooner or later nations should accept their own mistakes, the murders they commit. People who will read my book in Turkey, if they will only say\\"Here the Greek barbarism\\" or If it's going to evoke feelings of hatred towards Greece, it's better not to ever publish. As a researcher, my aim is to spread the fact that each Balkan country faces its own history, mistakes, murders. I believe that as these self-criticisms spread, the feelings of hatred among nations will diminish and the trumps of the extreme nationalists will disappear one by one. \\"[1] …. ‘’Greek soldiers and some armed local Christians attempted violence, murder, rape and looting for two days, citing several shots fired at the port of Izmir during the arrival of the Greek soldiers. 200 people were killed. 2500 people, including all the students and teachers of a class of a school, were arrested and tortured. The Greek soldiers attacked all the Muslim villages, as if a circle had been drawn up to a few kilometers beyond Izmir. The Allied research team blamed the Greek army for all the bloodshed in Izmir.’’ ‘’(Greek doctor tells) In the village near Uşak, Turkish women, children and elderly people were closed to the mosque. Some of our soldiers noticed the situation. Instead of breaking the door of the mosque and raping the women, as all the dirty men would do, they burned the grass they collected and threw it through the window of the mosque. People ran out of the smoke, and then our rascals started shooting at women and children as if they were shooting drills ...’’ ‘’(Kopruhisar, 1920: Greek officer Dimitriu tells) I entered the house, I passed over the body of a dead old Turkish man. Noises coming from inside. About 10 Greek soldiers lifted the skirt of a Turkish girl, was forced to dance. They said to me, \\"Come and taste the appetizer.\\" I said ‘Shame’’ in Turkish. The Turkish girl rushed to my feet and said, \\"Save me.\\" I begged the soldiers, I said don't do it. Somebody pulled out his bayonet and headed towards me. I had to escape. I couldn't forget the woman's screams. In the morning, about a thousand houses in Köprühisar were in flames.’’ (A Greek soldier tells): Prince Andreas ordered us to burn everything. (August 30, 1921: A photographer from the Greek army tells): We burn everything we leave. It was a terrifying sight. (July 9, 1921: Greek officer tells): We entered Arıveren village. The girls were raped in front of their parents. The soldiers slept on the silk quilts they had ransacked that night. (Major Panagakos recounts): In Uşak, the Turks hid their families in cemeteries at night. I saved a young girl whom two Greek soldiers tried to rape. Her mother started running and kissing my hands. Shortly ahead, her other two daughters lay lifeless on the floor.[2] Footnotes [1] STELYO BERBERAKİS - Yunanlılar, kendi tarihiyle yüzleşiyor [LINKED_TEXT: STELYO BERBERAKİS - Yunanlılar, kendi tarihiyle yüzleşiyor] [URL: https://www.sabah.com.tr/yazarlar/berberakis/2008/12/31/yunanlilar_kendi_tarihiyle_yuzlesiyor] [2] Türklere Nasıl Mezalim Yaptık [LINKED_TEXT: Türklere Nasıl Mezalim Yaptık] [URL: https://www.haberler.com/turklere-nasil-mezalim-yaptik-haberi/] Tsarist Russia played Armenia and backed them for the creation of Greater Armenia, they created revolutionary bands over a period of 20 years and then with 900,000 strong and armed committed the state sponsored Genocide, systematically exterminating and eradicating the Kurds and 600,000 Ottoman Armenians, and all the 2.4 million Turkic tribes in Anatolia..

In the Middle Bronze era this was conveyed by a channel (covered with rock panels) to a pool—an antecedent to the Roman aqueducts. Under King Hezekiah, around 700 BCE, to enhance water security and prevent access to the water by besieging enemy forces (like the Assyrians) this was replaced with a winding tunnel—533 metres long, at a very gentle incline, carved underground within the rock, from the spring to a pool at the southern end of the city, known in as Siloam Pool (in Hebrew, Breikhat Hashiloaḥ): Astonishingly, this was excavated from both ends of the route, with the workers meeting precisely in the middle.

In fact, living in Canada I would argue that foods such as mashed potato, or fish and chips, have a much better claim to being Canadian foods too (along with US ‘delicacies’ such as the hamburger, or the hard and brittle leather we call bacon). Other British foods are unique to Britain alone, such as the elusive spotted dick, or a lovely toad-in-the-hole, or perhaps a rougue deep-fried Mars bar. However, with the probable exception of that last dish, these items are good - or at least palatable - to a wider audience. The food I’d like to introduce is definitely an acquired taste, one which I have actually eaten, and one which finds its roots deep in the North Sea. A while back I was gifted a modest jar of pickled herring. Nothing looked out of the ordinary, and the writing was in English (not Swedish or Norwegian), so I assumed it was edible. In fact, I saw myself enjoying the treat as I am a huge fan of sour and pickled foods, and I am not against seafood, either. I knew something was wrong when the initial flavour was sweet. The mild disturbance continued as I tried to make up my mind about the rubbery texture which numbed the teeth. To this day, I still don’t know what to think of the pickle the herring was wrapped around, although that was probably the least offensive part of the meal. It is beyond me how some people love this food so much, although I assume that is the meaning of ‘acquired taste’. Every once in a while I try to eat this delicacy again, and I find myself intrigued and mildly horrified each time! I do believe this food is more or less associated with Nordic countries, but I believe it qualifies as a British food, too. According to Wikipedia, the inbreds we in Canada call Nova Scotians also enjoy the occasional pickled herring so, while the ‘acquired taste’ bit of the question rings true here, the ‘rest of the world’ bit of the question may not fit my answer. (Upon further research, I’ve discovered that the dish I had is usually called a [LINKED_TEXT: rollmops] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollmops], and has a greater geographic spread than I anticipated.)

Create a Bitcoin Ledger wallet. Today, buying and selling Bitcoin is easier for beginners than ever. As your first step, you'll want to sign up for something called a Bitcoin wallet. Like its name suggests, your wallet is a digital account that makes it fairly easy and convenient to buy, store, and sell your Bitcoin — think of it like a universal Bitcoin checking account. Unlike a checking account, however, starting a Bitcoin wallet usually takes less than a minute, can be done online, and is quite easy. Sites like coin base, blockchain, Binance, hive wallet, are just a few examples of reputable, reliable, and user-friendly sites for beginners to create their first wallet. Link your bank account to your wallet. Once you have a wallet, it's time to fill it with Bitcoin. Typically, to do this, you'll need to supply the financial details for a real-world bank account just like you would if you were setting up a PayPal account or signing up for another online payment service. Usually, you'll need at least your bank account number, the routing number for the account, and your full name as it appears on the account. You can almost always find these on your online banking account or on your paper checks.[2] Note that you may also be asked to provide contact information, like a phone number.To be clear, linking your bank account to your Bitcoin wallet is not any more of a risk to your personal security than it is to shop online. Virtually all reputable Bitcoin services make a point to advertise their high standards for security and encryption. While Bitcoin services have been targeted by hackers in the past, so too have many major online retailers.[3] [4]It may also be possible to use your credit card to buy Bitcoin instead of your bank account. Buy BTC with money from your bank account. Once you've supplied your bank information and it's been verified by the Bitcoin service, it should be fairly easy to start purchasing BTC and adding it to your wallet. Usually, on your wallet page, there should be an option labeled \\"Buy bitcoin\\" or something similar — clicking this should take you through a straightforward transaction process that uses money from your bank account to purchase BTC. Note that the price of Bitcoin can (and does) change from day to day — sometimes significantly. Because Bitcoin is a relatively new form of currency, its market has yet to become stable. The current dollar-to-BTC exchange rate should be clearly listed when you buy it — as of October 2014, 1 BTC was equal to about 350.[5] Use your Bitcoin to buy from retailers that accept it. In recent years, an increasing number of businesses have begun to accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. Though these businesses still represent a minority, some major names have already made the transition. Below is just a shortlist of online vendors that accept BTC: AmazonWordPressbedding, furniture, electronics, jewelry, clothing, and moreVictoria's SecretSubwayZapposWhole FoodsIf you're market-savvy (or lucky), you can conceivably generate value for yourself this way by buying Bitcoin when its price is low, then purchasing goods when the value of Bitcoin is high to get a favorable deal on the goods. You can then sell these goods to make a profit or simply keep them. Sell your Bitcoin to another user. Unfortunately, selling Bitcoin isn't quite as easy as buying it. There is no easy way to \\"cash-out\\" your Bitcoins and receive money in your bank account — instead, you'll have to find a buyer who's willing to pay for them with money (or goods/services). In general, one of the easiest ways to do this is to sign up with an online Bitcoin marketplace. Once you find a buyer, you will complete the transaction through the website but will otherwise deal directly with him or her. To use this method, you'll usually have to register a seller account and verify your identity in a process separate from the one used to create your wallet. In the US, CoinCola, CoinBase and LocalBitcoins are three websites that offer this sort of selling service. In the UK, BitBargain and Bittylicious are two reputable options.In addition, some sites like (purse), allow sellers to give Bitcoin to buyers who then use their own money to purchase goods online and send them to the seller — in essence, this is a roundabout way of using Bitcoin to buy from vendors that do not accept the currency.[6] Alternatively, sell your Bitcoin on an exchange. Another option for sellers is to use a Bitcoin exchange. These sites work by pairing sellers with prospective buyers. Once a seller is found, the website acts as a sort of intermediary or escrow service, holding the money until both parties are verified and the transaction is completed. Usually, there is a minor fee associated with this service. Selling with this method is not usually an instantaneous process. In some cases, users have even complained that exchange services can take an inordinate amount of time to complete transactions compared to other options.[7] Reputable, well-known exchanges include Circle, Kraken, and Virtex.In addition, some exchange sites like Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, and Bitcoinshop allow you to trade Bitcoin for other digital currencies (like Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero). Consider setting up a regular purchase scheme. If you're serious about investing in Bitcoin, you may want to devote a small portion of each paycheck towards buying the virtual currency — this is a great way to amass lots of Bitcoin over time without any major one-time expenses. Many Bitcoin wallet sites (like, for instance, Coinbase) offer the option to set up regular withdrawals for the purpose of buying Bitcoin. This generally works a little like regular withdrawals for a 401k — you specify a certain amount of money, and this money is withdrawn from your account at regular intervals and used to buy Bitcoin automatically.Consider buying Bitcoin locally. If you'd like to keep your money in the local community, consider using a service that allows you to sell to people near you. Rather than pairing you with anonymous online buyers from anywhere in the world, certain sites give you the option of searching for sellers in your local area. If you choose to meet with these sellers in person, observe all of the normal precautions you would for meeting someone you met online — meet in a public location in the daytime and, if possible, don't show up alone. See our article on the subject for more information. LocalBitcoin: fastest and easiest way to buy and sell bitcoin is one of the most prominent local bitcoin marketplaces online. The site allows you to search for buyers in over 6,000 cities and 200 countries, including the US.[8] Consider buying into a Bitcoin investing company. One option that's often advertised as being \\"less risky\\" than buying and selling Bitcoin directly is to put money into an investment agency. The Bitcoin Investment Trust, for instance, allows users to buy and sell stock in the company just as they would for any other company. The Trust then uses the money to buy and sell Bitcoin with the goal of making money for the investors. Because the company deals solely in buying and selling Bitcoin, the company's share price is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. However, some users find this option preferable because the professional investors at the Trust are (presumably) experts and because it allows them to forgo the process of finding sellers and managing their Bitcoin accounts on their own.[9]Consider \\"mining\\" Bitcoin. Ever wonder where Bitcoins come from? In fact, new Bitcoins are created through a complicated computing process called \\"mining.\\" In very simplified terms, when mining BTC, your computer competes with other users' computers to solve complex problems. When your computer solves the problem first, you are awarded Bitcoin. The supposed benefits of mining include the fact that you are essentially \\"making\\" BTC for yourself without using any of your real-world money. However, in practice, maintaining competitive status as a Bitcoin miner can involve substantial investments in specialized hardware. The entire mining process is a complicated one that is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see our Bitcoin mining article.In addition, it's important to understand that because Bitcoin are awarded in \\"blocks\\" of multiple Bitcoin at once, it's usually in your best interest to join an established \\"pool\\" of miners, which will allow you to work together towards solving the block and share the rewards. Going it alone can make you very uncompetitive as a miner — you may go a year or more without making a single Bitcoin.[10] Buy low, sell high. At its core, the strategy for buying and selling Bitcoin isn't much different than that for buying and selling stocks or commodities in the real world. Buying Bitcoin when the dollar exchange rate is low and selling it when the exchange rate is high is a money-making proposition. Unfortunately, since the Bitcoin market is so volatile, it can be extremely difficult to predict when the Bitcoin price will rise or fall, so any Bitcoin investment is inherently risky. As an example of the Bitcoin market's volatility, in October 2013, the price for Bitcoin was hovering around 120-125 per Bitcoin. Within a month and a half, the price had shot up almost tenfold to nearly 1,000 per Bitcoin. A year later, the price was a third of its peak value at about 350 per Bitcoin. It is unknown when the next price spike will occur (if ever). Stay up-to-date on Bitcoin market trends. As mentioned above, it's impossible to predict which way the Bitcoin market will go with certainty. However, your best hope for making money off of a Bitcoin investment is probably to monitor trends in the marketplace frequently. Because the Bitcoin marketplace can fluctuate rapidly, money-making opportunities like spikes in the exchange rate can appear and disappear in a matter of days, so keep a close eye on the exchange rate for your best chance at success. You may also want to become a member of Bitcoin discussion forums (like, for instance, the forums at Bitcoin forum index) so that you can communicate with other investors about market predictions. Keep in mind, however, that no investors, no matter their expertise, can predict the Bitcoin market with certainty. Use Bitcoin wealth to purchase more stable investments. One possible way to gain some stability out of your Bitcoin wealth is to use it to buy more stable investments, like stocks or commodities. Certain sites will allow you to do this — for instance, CRVN CAPITAL allows you to purchase gold with BTC. You might even want to sell your Bitcoin and use the money to invest in the stock market or in bonds. While a conservative stock portfolio generally offers the best potential for stable, moderate growth, most financial experts agree that even relatively risky stocks generally have a lower capacity for fluctuation than the Bitcoin market.[11]Never put more money into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose. As with any sort of risky investment, it's best to think of the money you put into Bitcoin as money you're \\"playing\\" with — if you profit, that's great, but if you lose it, you won't be financially ruined. Don't put more money into Bitcoin than you can't reasonably survive without. Bitcoin can vanish in the blink of an eye (and have done so in the past), so the consequences for gambling too much money on Bitcoin can be dire.[12] Don't buy into the sunk cost fallacy — the idea that you're \\"too deep\\" into an investment to pull out.[13] Missing a price spike and selling at a slight loss is better than waiting and selling at a large loss. How to Use Cryptocurrency Decide what types of cryptocurrency you want. There are many different cryptocurrencies out there. Which cryptocurrency is right for you depends to a large extent on what you want to do with it. Newer cryptocurrencies may be more volatile, and likely won't be widely accepted as payment for goods and services. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency. It's the most well-known and the most valuable. It's also accepted in many places as currency, including online retailers and brick-and-mortar merchants.Litecoin is also accepted by many retailers. If you want to use your cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services, Litecoin may also be a good choice.If you're looking at smaller niche cryptocurrencies, do some research first to make sure it will suit your purposes. Choose a cryptocurrency exchange. There are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges, but not all exchanges work in all countries. Different exchanges also offer different types of cryptocurrency, accept different methods of payment, and charge different fees.[3] Compare 3 or 4 exchanges to choose the one that's best for you. Make sure you understand the exchange's interface and how to use it. Because exchanges are extremely vulnerable to hackers, carefully assess each exchange's security.Trading crypto maybe something harder for people who are yet to get exposed to a crypto trading platform, well if you are interested to learn more about the best crypto trading platform <<[LINKED_TEXT: CLICK HERE] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/bestcryptotrading/home]>>On crypto exchanges, higher fees don't necessarily correspond to better service or more protection. Generally, choose an exchange that offers the cryptocurrency you want for the lowest fees possible. Create a trading account. To buy cryptocurrency, you must register as a user and verify your identity. To start, you'll provide basic information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number, and email address. You'll need to scan both sides of a government-issued photo ID to verify your identity.[4] The exchange will send you an email with a code you'll use to verify your email address.You'll typically also be texted a code that you'll have to enter to log onto your account. This code is part of two-factor identification (2FA), and makes your account more secure than simply entering a username and password. Connect your method of payment. If it's your first time buying cryptocurrency, you'll have to use fiat currency, which is a national currency such as dollars or euros. Most exchanges will allow you to pay by connecting your bank account, or by using a credit or debit card.[5] Some crypto exchanges accept payment through other payment services, such as PayPal.Depending on the method of payment you choose, it may be 3 to 5 days before the connection is completed and you can make your first purchase. Place your order for cryptocurrency. Typically, you'll specify the type of cryptocurrency you want and the amount of \\"coins\\" (or fractions of a coin) you want to purchase. You may also have the option of specifying the amount of money you want to spend. The amount of cryptocurrency you get for that money depends on the value of that cryptocurrency.[6] Cryptocurrency exchanges work similarly to stock exchanges. If you're familiar with placing an order to buy or sell the stock, you shouldn't have any trouble navigating orders for cryptocurrency.You can also buy one type of cryptocurrency with another type of cryptocurrency. The values of different cryptocurrencies relative to each other fluctuate. Keep your private keys secure until you're ready to spend your cryptocurrency. When you go to spend your cryptocurrency, you do so by giving the merchant or other person your private key. Anyone who has your private key has control over the cryptocurrency. Once someone has your private key, they can send your cryptocurrency wherever they want. Don't give anyone your private key unless you are paying for goods or services.Your cryptocurrency will likely be safe if you keep it in your exchange account for a few days. If you're not going to spend it, though, you should choose a separate wallet.There are several different types of wallets available that will secure your private keys. Choose the one that provides the best balance of convenience and security for your needs. The best wallet for you will depend on how you plan to use your cryptocurrency. Use cryptocurrency for purchases from online retailers. Many online retailers large and small accept various cryptocurrencies. More popular and established cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are typically more widely accepted.[7] Tech retailers and service providers, such as Microsoft, are more likely to accept cryptocurrency. However, other online shopping sites, such as Overstock, take cryptocurrency as a method of payment.Look for cryptocurrency logos near the shopping cart or payment page to determine whether the website takes cryptocurrency. If one of your favorite shopping sites doesn't accept crypto, you might send a suggestion and recommend they start. Buy goods or services from local merchants who accept cryptocurrency. There are some small businesses that have started accepting various cryptocurrencies. If you've set up a mobile wallet, you can exchange cryptocurrency for goods and services from these merchants. The process works similarly to how you would pay with your phone using a credit or debit card.[8] To determine whether a merchant accepts the type of cryptocurrency you have, look for a logo near the cash register. This will generally be in the same place where a merchant would display logos for the credit cards they accept. Build an investment portfolio with your cryptocurrency. Rather than spending cryptocurrency, many people choose to hold it in the hopes its value will increase exponentially. If you're thinking about doing this, keep in mind that any cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment.[9] Including cryptocurrency in a diversified portfolio could be successful. However, balance your cryptocurrency with more conservative investments to avoid a significant loss. Download software for more control over your crypto transactions. With a software or desktop wallet, you don't have to rely on the availability of a service to complete cryptocurrency transactions. Software wallets give you more security and flexibility than many other types of wallets.[10] You may have more security if you download your wallet software to a dedicated computer that remains offline except when you're processing a transaction.Depending on your connection speed, the blockchain may take as long as 2 days to download. Start the download before you make your first order. That way your cryptocurrency isn't sitting in your account at the exchange, where it is more vulnerable to hackers. Try an online wallet if you have a small amount of cryptocurrency. Online or web wallets aren't as secure as other types of wallets, so they aren't ideal for large amounts of cryptocurrency. However, if you only want small amounts and plan to use them mainly to purchase goods and services from the internet, a web wallet may be the best option for you.[11] Web wallets also have fairly intuitive interfaces and are similar to other types of online accounts. If you aren't particularly tech-savvy, a web wallet may be easier for you to use.Hybrid wallets, such as Copay, can be accessed on multiple devices, and are generally a little more secure than web-only wallets. These may also come in handy if you plan to use your cryptocurrency at brick-and-mortar retailers in addition to online. Use a mobile wallet for convenient, easy access to your cryptocurrency. While mobile wallets provide you the most freedom of access to your cryptocurrency, they may not necessarily be the most secure. However, they are user-friendly and can be good for beginners.[12] Mobile wallet apps are available for both iPhone and Android smartphones. Some, such as Breadwallet, allow you to manage your account with a username and password. Others, such as Airbitz, do not actually store your cryptocurrency, providing a little more security.If you have a mobile wallet, make sure your phone cannot be accessed without a secure password, and keep it locked at all times when you're not using it. Buy a hardware wallet to secure larger amounts of cryptocurrency. Hardware wallets are offline devices that only store cryptocurrency. Since no additional software can be installed, they aren't vulnerable to hackers like other wallets. These devices start at around 100, so are best for larger amounts of cryptocurrency that you plan to hold for investment purposes.[13] Hardware wallets will give you the best security for your cryptocurrency. However, if you store your cryptocurrency on a hardware wallet, you won't be able to access it conveniently. Hold cryptocurrency for a long-term investment with a paper wallet. A paper wallet stores both your public and private keys on a piece of paper in the form of a QR code. Since it's just a piece of paper, it's completely invulnerable to hackers.[14] To regain access to your cryptocurrency, you simply scan the codes. You'll have to have another wallet, such as a web wallet, to scan your cryptocurrency into if you want to use it.While paper wallets aren't vulnerable to hacking, they remain vulnerable to the same threats any piece of paper would be. For example, if your paper wallet burns in a fire, you've lost all access to your cryptocurrency the same as if cash were burned in a fire."},{"instruction":"What is keeping commercial spaceflight from being readily available to the public?","output":"Costs!

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

That’s what makes him so amazing. He’s basically my frame, which wouldn’t be imposing at all for an NBA player, not even a point guard. Yet, he’s one of the best in the league, maybe all-time, with what he’s already accomplished. A guy like LeBron, extremely talented, has always worked hard, no doubt.

Your results probably won't be the same as mine were. The first time was July 10, 1969. It was a hot and sultry Thursday. How can I be so specific? It was the day that I got my driving license. The ink wasn't dry on my pink slip (temp license) and my mom actually let me take out the family iron with one of my brothers in tow. First order of the day was to see how fast this thing (1963 Ford Country Sedan, 352 cu in 2v, 3 on the tree) would go. We took the surface streets from Brighton to West Newton and jumped on the new turnpike extension heading towards Boston and dropped the hammer. About 3/4 of a mile up the road as we passed 105 MPH, the blue gumball machine came on behind us along with the new electronic whoop-whoop siren. Busted! It was a half a mile to the hard shoulder emergency lane and I used all of it to slow down with those manual drum brakes as my dreams of ever driving again went up in the acrid smoke of brake linings stressed beyond their design limits. I guess that the cop got laid the night before as he was initially polite and perfunctory. “License and registration, please, sir.“ Fancy that! A 40-something state trooper just called a 16 year old kid, “sir!” Maybe it wasn't going to be that bad. Then I handed him my pink slip. The spit hit the fan. Literally. “Pink slip? You're driving over 100 on a fucking PINK SLIP? When did you get it?” “About an hour ago, sir.” “An hour? A FUCKING HOUR AGO? What the FUCK is wrong with you, kid?” (OK, I'm demoted from “sir.” I deserved it.) “I just wanted to see how fast it would go, sir.” The fusillade of cop spit bouncing off the dash fan (remember those?) into my face ended as a light seemed to go on behind his mirrored aviator sunglasses. Yeah, he remembered. “You know that I could arrest you for felony dangerous driving and impound this car, right?” “Yes, sir.” “What would your folks think about that?” “They'd be pissed. And fucked without the car.” “They sure would!” He pulled out his notepad from his shirt pocket and wrote down my details. “I can't even write a warning ticket. Anything on a pink slip is an automatic one year revocation by the Registry. If I ever see you speeding again, I will write you up for this one. Now get the fuck out of here before I change my mind!” “Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!” The 2nd time was about 2 years later. The family was camping in western MA. I had to work, so I was heading out Rte 2 to meet them after I got off at 9:30. I was driving dad's new Mercury Monterrey, 428 cu in 4v Cobra Jet. Nice ride. Fast. A few miles west of Concord, the distinctive lights of a Chrysler pulled up on my rear bumper and parked there. He was so close that I couldn't see his headlights any more. I tried to wave him past me. No go. Slowed down a bit and he stayed put. Pulled over to the shoulder and he followed. Fuck this! Dropped the hammer! I pulled away from him as if he was running a slant 6. I held it at 115 MPH for about 5 minutes until his lights had long disappeared. Broke it down to the speed limit, hit the cruise control, turned on the A/C, and popped a Grand Funk Railroad 8-track into the player. Perfect cruise! About 30 minutes later, I noticed that same familiar headlight pattern in the rear view mirror. This time he was coming up FAST. The road was now a 4 lane divided highway but he was making no effort to take the left lane to pass. Time to drop the hammer again. Cut the A/C to get as much power as possible and quickly hit a bit over 120 MPH. This time he stayed on my ass and matched my speed. I was starting to get genuinely scared. Blue lights! I'm actually relieved that it's a Statie in a Chrysler! Pulled over and stopped. I'm really liking these power disc brakes! Cop doesn't even ask for a license or registration, but asks if it's such an affront to my manhood that he passes me in the middle of nowhere. I explain the encounter with another Chrysler 30 or 40 miles back, and that I honestly thought that he was the same vehicle. He asks for my license and retreats to his cruiser. He comes back a few minutes later and says that my story checks out and that I'm free to go. I thanked him and left. So, I got stopped twice and walked twice. Have I ever broken 100 MPH on public roads since? Yup, my record is 192 MPH in my boss's Ferrari. Multiple times on motorcycles and other cars, but never got stopped. When was the last time? A few months ago when I bought my Miata. 128 MPH with throttle to spare.

I think that Elon Musk and SpaceX don't have enough money to colonize Mars. I don't think SpaceX's funding is enough to build human settlements on Mars. This means that if Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars, he (and his SpaceX) will have to work with other space agencies like NASA, ESA, China's space agency, and Roscosmos. If space agencies across the world unite and start working together and focus their funding on one single project for Mars colonization, Mars will be successfully colonized very quickly.

Here are some of the most common investment options: Stocks: Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you are essentially buying a small piece of the company. Stocks can be a risky investment, but they also have the potential to generate high returns.Bonds: Bonds are loans that you make to a company or government. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer of the bond. Bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks, but they also have the potential to generate lower returns.Mutual funds: Mutual funds are baskets of stocks or bonds that are managed by a professional. Mutual funds can be a good way to diversify your investment portfolio and reduce your risk.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they are traded on exchanges like stocks. This makes them more liquid than mutual funds, which can be a good thing if you need to access your money quickly.Real estate: Real estate can be a good investment, but it is important to do your research and understand the risks involved. Real estate can be a illiquid investment, which means that it can be difficult to sell quickly if you need to access your money.Commodities: Commodities are raw materials such as oil, gold, and wheat. Commodities can be a good investment, but they are also very volatile. This means that their prices can fluctuate wildly, which can be risky for investors. It is important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to invest money. The best way to invest will depend on your individual circumstances and goals. It is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before you invest any money. Here are some additional tips for investing money: Start early. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.Invest regularly. Even if you can only invest a small amount each month, it will add up over time.Diversify your portfolio. Don't put all of your eggs in one basket. Spread your money across different types of investments to reduce your risk.Rebalance your portfolio regularly. As your investments grow, you may need to rebalance your portfolio to make sure that it still meets your risk tolerance and investment goals.Don't panic sell. When the market takes a downturn, it's important to stay calm and not panic sell. Selling your investments at a loss will only lock in your losses.Get help from a financial advisor. If you're not sure where to start, or if you need help managing your risk, you may want to consider getting help from a financial advisor. A financial advisor can help you create a personalized investment plan that meets your specific needs and goals. I hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"Why did Hannibal Barca tell Scipio Africanus he thought Pyrrhus of Epirus was almost as good as Alexander the Great and better than even himself despite Pyrrhus's infamy for sustaining catastrophic losses?","output":"This story is in Livy and Plutarch, but it probably did not ever happen. In the story, the literary character Hannibal says so because he believes it to be true (the question WHY is the wrong question). Pyrrhus fought many battles about which we have little information, but he had a very high victory ratio. He took heavy losses in all three battles against Rome, who fought longer than did the usual Greek or Punic opponents. Pyrrhus inflicted even heavier casualties on the Romans but won Cadmeian victories, thereafter called Pyrrhic generals. His contemporaries considered him an excellent general, and several of them were adjudant generals of Alexander and veterans of many battles. Pyrrhus does not have a record of infamy: he had a first rate reputation as a general. re: Hannibal in the story: Hannibal is either praising or more likely deflating Scipio. The punchline comes after Hannibal lists himself as the 3rd best general of all time to which Scipio protests, but I, Scipio, beat you at Zama. Hannibal comes right back, if I had beaten you at Zama, Scipio, I would rank myself #1, Alexander #2 and Pyrrhus #3!! Hannibal is saying either me beating Scipio would be more impressive than what Alexander did OR Scipio had me outgunned at Zama, but I am still the better general.

Guess why I'm so happy? I woke up early in the morning! This may sound a bit weird and funny. Of course, it's not a big deal. But I have been trying to improve my screwed up sleep schedule since the beginning of the lockdown and it's been 3 months already! Phew, time runs hastily! I have this stupid habit of staying awake all night and sleeping off the entire morning. Well, it may sound normal in this period, but I just realized a few stuff which is actually having a consequence because of this. 1) I cannot wake up fresh no matter if I have 10-11 hours of sound sleep. It's just that, waking up at the noon do not make me motivated to seize the day. 2) After waking up, I will still have the dizziness and all I do is straight up watching some random series in the bed. 3) staying in the bed all day sounds like a dream. I always love being lazy and cozy. But it kinda had an impact on my mental health which crippled my overthinking superpowers. 4) It always seems like I have a lot of eternity in the day if I wake up early. 5) I couldn't get my job done. When I wake up late I always feel like I do not have enough time for the day. It's weird, I'd be just watching series and listening to music the whole day yet I wouldn't have the enthusiasm to get my errand done. 6) All the stuff I want to do which is pending in my to-do list will be unticked. There would be no willingness to do it, my procrastination level will be all the way up. 7) I always thought I was a night owl and could work on my stuff late at night with some caffeine. But honestly, doing the same work in the morning clearly shows progress and efficiency. Our mind is so relaxed. I may sound like a boomer waking up early is productive and stuff, but trust me that's really helping. I couldn't be consistent with waking up early in the morning. I made sure no matter how tired I feel, I definitely don't want to take a nap in between the day. My nap will prolong to 2-3hours in no time and boom, I will have trouble sleeping early at night. Going for a run early morning releasing the endorphins for the day is far better than craving for dopamine staying up late. I always feel bad staying up late, and it's so hard for me to bring back my schedule. Sometimes I will be persistent for a week and continue being miserable. The reason is maybe I sleep off Sundays since it's an off day. But that will again, screw up my sleep schedule and it brings back to square one. Wake up, early lads. It's tremendous honestly.

This sounds wonderful for older workers (i.e. those over 40), but the practical result is that most employers will not hire anyone over 40 because workers can’t be pensioned off at 65. Thus, employers are required to keep their older workers on the payroll long past their “best before” date.

Operational secrecy here is not the concern, the goal is to cause serious concern for the Russians. In this information age, they expect average Russian soldiers to be able to pick up on rumors and reports, and foreign news releases are great for that. Hundreds of new vehicles they will have to fight, heavy artillery that can hit them from long ranges, anywhere, top of the line anti tank helicopters to hunt their support down, and hunt them down too. The West is fighting a psychological battle against Russian soldiers , and pictures, and numbers, and the promise of “more, more, more”, is all part of it. Russian morale is already fairly low, with limited supplies, and poor quality food, except when they’ve stolen something edible, and adding to the concern, makes them fight worse, and more importantly, surrender more.

The reason that's ok is because such a legal right doesn't obligate any particular lawyer to do anything he or she hasn't signed up for. Rather, it's the government who are required to pay for succ a lawyer. It's the same idea with public healthcare.

It’s estimated to be as high as 30–40% of all pregnancies but it’s impossible to know the number with complete certainty. This means that (a) whatever god you worship is performing far more abortions than any person ever could, and (b) that granting full life status and the rights gained therein to an embryo are pointless and cruel, especially to the woman who’s body it relies on.

In this list, I will not include Bhagwan Parshuram, Shree Krishna and balram ji. Parshuram and shree krishna were only two atimaharathi in duaparyug. Comparing shree krishna to anyone is foolishness. 15. Duryodhana Duryodhana was best mace warrior in Mahabharat ( stated by balram) with very high physical strength. He was trained by Kripacharya, dronacharya and Balram. 14. Jarasandh He was father in law of Kansa and king of Magadha. He was very powerful and had attacked Mathura 18 times in presence of shree krishna. He was killed by Bhima by dividing his body symmetrically. 13. Kalyavana His father was a great Rishi and he has taken a boon from Mahadev that no one can kill his son kalyavana by any weapon. This made him undefeatable. He attacked vrindavan and challenged shree krishna, where shree krishna fled from war and went to a gupha. A Rishi was in yognidra, when kalvana attacked him supposing to be shree krishna. He was killed by Rishi's yog Agni. 12.) Abhimanyu A sixteen year boy who literally broke chakravyuh ( one of the toughest vyuh). He was trained by Arjuna, shree krishna, pradyumna and balram ji. He has killed almost 1.5 akshoni warriors in Mahabharat. He has defeated karna twice, drona. He has given a good fight to Bhishma and has deheaded thousands of great warriors. He was among most skilled warriors. He was killed by Seven maharathi together by chhal. 11. Bheem Bhim has power of 10,000 elephants. He was also a excellent mace warrior addition to that he was a good Archer also. He had immunation to all kind of poisons. He had killed 99 kauravs along with duryodhana. He had defeated karna once. He had killed jarasandh and keechak. He was less skilled but he had immense physical strength, so no one was able to win from him in hand to hand fight. 10. Satayaki Most underrated warrior of Mahabharat. He was a yadav warrior and commander of shri Krishna’s narayani sena. He has fought from pandavas side. He has killed approx 2 akshoni sena. In addition, he has defeated karna twice and has deheaded bhuri sharavan. Arjuna used to appoint him as security incharge of Yudhishthir in his absence. He was trained by Arjuna. He was among few warriors who was alive after Mahabharata war. 9.Karna I have listened to many people who used to told that karna was the greatest warrior of Mahabharat and was undefeatable with kavach and kundal. No! He was a great warriors but not even in the top five. So let me clear this myth.

He sacrificed his life in yagna when told by shree krishna that “there are only three in the whole world whose sacrifice can establish pandavas victory, shree krishna himself, arjuna and iravan\\".

He had killed more than 2 akshoni sena in Mahabharat. He is shown very less in TV serials. There are many instances in Mahabharat of praising him. He was only one who didn't fled from battle field during ghatotkach attack. When he was fighting with Arjuna during viraat yudh, even devas were praising him. Arjun himself has stated that fighting Ashwathama in anger is very dangerous. Shree krishna cursed him to live till the end of kalyug so he is still alive. 2. Bishma Pitamah He was the son of Devi ganga and king shantanu. He was trained my Devi Ganga and other devas and Bhagwan Parshuram. He was greatest warrior of his time.

Starting from croissant, a very common breakfast for Europeans, it's crunchy, it has layers and oh God who decided it's shape, it's the worst combination of three. Source: Pinterest Let's see how etiquette consultants advice you to eat a croissant. Don't be that person who takes miny bites. It appears very fake and shows how embarassed you're while eating. Also don't say that you're full to avoid the situation, people are smart enough to figure out and how long will you make these excuses? It's croissant it should be consumed in it's original crunchy form, don't ruin it's taste by dipping it in coffee or tea. There's no need to use cutlery. It's obvious, you'll never finish your croissant on time if you'll use cutlery. Consultant: Anna Bey Image source: Instagram Samosa is also crunchy, it's shape can make you drool, but it's not easy to eat samosa like civilized humans. Will I avoid eating this delicious snack then? Nah man. Source: Pinterest I've gained some diplomacy in eating this delicious snack properly, here are some tips, take small sized samosa so that you can hold it properly, use tissue paper for holding, use of chutney or sause can help you avoid the mess. (Just like croissant, samosa too should be consumed in it's crunchy and crispy form, so please limit the use of chutney) IDK why some people say they cannot eat somasa without red chutney, I mean it's a complete snack and according to me chutney is not required at all. Burgers The thicker the burger the tastier it is, but layers cause difficulty in eating it like a hooman again. Those people who like to have extra layers of cheese, spinach, or patties in their burgers they eat it in most monstrous form.

Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"I am going to give you a short, nonjudgmental answer, and then elaborate: Maybe, maybe not. Some will flat out refuse to euthanize an otherwise healthy animal because of behavioral issues or minor illnesses. Expect cold glares at a minimum, possibly a harshly worded lecture on responsible pet ownership in line with some of the other answers here on Quora. Some vets will euthanize rather than risk you abandoning it on the side of the road, taking it to a shelter where the kill methods are not necessarily as humane, or — worst of all — taking the matter into your own hands. This is the veterinarian’s personal call, but do not expect them to be happy about it, either. Some vets will offer to take the cat from you (you give up ownership) if it needs treatment that you cannot afford, but has a high likelihood of recovering. The vet will then rehome it themselves, or make it an office cat. Do not expect them to keep you on as a client if you should get another cat, though, as they are likely to judge you an irresponsible owner. That said, throwing up and peeing can be signs of stress or minor health issues. Maybe you aren’t keeping the litter box clean enough. Maybe it has hairballs, or has developed an allergy to its food (or a change in food). There are a LOT of things you could do about these issues before you go to the extreme of euthanasia, including rehoming the cat yourself. Talk to your vet, then follow your conscience and try to do the right thing for both your family and the living creature whose life you have in your hands."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"Salute people ., How is it going?

The take one of parental figures out of the home and it begins to fall apart, starting with values and tradition. Pushing women to join the workforce (yes, they pushed it- women’s lib was a false flag) was just another way to destroy the American Family. When Mom is at work, who is watching the kids?

Since the world became highly industrialized new products are invented all the time and put into the marketplace mostly because these items make life easier (on the needs side) or more fun (on the wants side). Since people want to get paid and Gold is a limited resources the money supply is limited to whatever the world says the value of the shiny rock is. On the other hand the full faith and credit of 325 plus million people in the US (at least for now) has more value than all the gold on Earth (or at least that is the perception again for now).

Your responsibilities include preparing these documents, their audit, sending to signees, etc. The procedures are implemented on an ongoing basis not once per day. It's a long hustle, isn't it? With this in mind, we came to the conclusion about creating an app, called KeepSolid Sign that can solve the issue and greatly reduce the amount of paperwork. How can it be useful for sales professionals? With its help, they have an opportunity to track the current status of the documents. This is very handy. The feature allows them to focus on the indeed important tasks rather than waste their time with double checking whether everybody has signed necessary papers. I was struck by a passing reference that it's currently believed more than 35% of sales professionals' workday is spent performing administrative tasks. As a result, they have much less time for priority one - closing deals. KeepSolid Sign helps to forget this hassles and get income faster. Among one more benefits of the app are cross-device synchronization and offline mode. They give an opportunity to sign important contracts anywhere in the world regardless of the internet connection quality and use the most convenient device for our customers. These features provide them with a smooth and efficient work experience. One more curious facts I could rustle up - 68% of the best sales teams have leveraged electronic signatures to improve customer experience. Given a huge amount of documents, there is a high probability some of them will be lost. Hope you know where this is heading. An electronic signature app will rid sales teams of this hustle and bustle through an end-to-end digitized process.

Where should I go? What is go inside?","output":"I am not a guru but this may be relevant. Meditation is one aspect of a holistic approach to spiritual inquiry taught by the Buddha and, many other wisdom-beings through the ages. Meditation is a natural process - it's not a technique. We often benefit from guidance to begin with but, when the process takes-off it has its own momentum. Techniques are employed in a different kind of learning i.e. knowledge acquisition and, applied learning. True meditation isn't something that we learn about - vicariously. Its not something that we 'do'. It ‘simply’ happens when we let-go, settle down and, settle-in - we are immersed/baptised in peace and clarity. Not as a ritualised practice - in truth. There's an effortless movement through deepening levels of natural stillness. Do you see the difference between doing something and, letting go? In a garden we may be busy gardening. At other times, we may relax, kick-back and, just appreciate what's in the garden. Natural stillness is like this: we are not busy with some kind of activity, there's a letting-go of the 'doer' and doing. It's about being not doing? This is when ‘peace’ starts to flower - open up. The most beautiful, fragrant flower in the garden of life. There's no happiness without peace - plain and simple. Meditation is what takes place as we let go of - not grasp or, cling to - ‘experience’ as it unfolds. Remaining still, settled, relaxed, nonreactive, kind. We may slowly and gently relax the body and mind through directing our attention, scanning and relieving tension consciously then, we simply let go and, 'see' what happens. Allowing space for the breath to come into awareness and, not trying to ignore it, if it does, can be a simple way to enter natural stillness. As a consequence of reaction-free attention while remaining still, the stream of consciousness - internally - the movement of thought and, the feelings they gives rise to, loses momentum - gaps begin to open-up between thoughts - and the whole process begins to cease, go into abeyance then, there's a natural stillness and silence. This silence is then attended to, it's beautiful-quality becomes increasingly apparent then, we are left with the beauty alone then, a unique joy, total ease, no more grasping and clinging then, when there's no more grasping and clinging, the seperative sense of self vanishes. If reaction-free attention is sustained over many days the sense of self may cease to arise - at all. This opens up new vistas of discovery/seeing/being that were previously unavailable, inaccessible. No parachute no ground… It's possible to relate to experience in this way in daily life and, in meditation. When this happens in daily life and, in periods of natural stillness, when there's an unbroken flow, a continuity of reaction-free attention, this movement towards stillness and clarity deepens. It triggers a deepening process of discovery. The emergence of transformative insights. This is not an exercise, a method that is practiced, a series of techniques enacted by someone. As stillness deepens the idea of a someone doing anything is seen to be an assumption. The thinker, the doer, the experiencer, ceases to arise as a mental-event, an act of self-identification, a seperative ‘sense of self'. This 'cessation' of subjective experiencing doesn't mean life - daily life - stops happening. Life goes on beautifully but, not as before. Life isn't taken personally, life is 'living' itself. It's always been this way but, it's rarely noticed or embodied in fullness/wholeness. This is the end of sorrow, lamentation and, despair. When the world's in which we coarise come to stillness there's a true-cessation in 'emptiness' (shunyata). The stilling of all formations. “To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour” - William Blake"},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

David Muller at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and his colleagues captured this image using a praseodymium orthoscandate crystal. They used a technique called ptychography, in which they used an electron microscope to analyze the crystal by calculating the angles of scattered electrons to work out the shape of the atoms that scattered them. This image is double the resolution of a zoomed-in image of atoms made in 2018 by Muller and his team, which was itself triple the resolution of others taken at the time with different techniques. In 2018, Muller and his team used a 2D material to limit the amount of electron scattering that happens in thicker material and makes it difficult to tell where the electrons had scattered from. “The key breakthrough we had this year have we figured out a way to unscramble this multiple scattering, and this is an 80-year-old problem,” says Muller. “For 80 years we haven’t had a general solution and now with some very clever algorithms developed by our colleagues [who work with x-rays] and then modified for electron scattering, we were able to untangle this multiple scattering.” This allowed the team to look at thicker samples and achieve a better resolution. The blurring in the current image comes from the movement of the atoms themselves (pictured above). “We can do a little bit better by cooling the sample down because when you cool the sample, the atoms don’t jiggle as much,” says Muller.https://qr.ae/pGAcna] [URL: https://qr.ae/pGAcna]You can read my full article on it and if you like follow the space."},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"Not only did I see it, I executed it myself.

It was clear that they were struggling to keep up with the competition and were on the brink of bankruptcy. But I also knew that they had a few key assets that could be valuable to the right buyer. So I made my move. I approached the company with an offer to buy their assets and take over their operations. At first, they were hesitant. They didn't want to sell to a competitor. But I was persuasive, and I knew that I could turn the company around if I had the right resources. Eventually, they agreed to my terms. I paid a fair price for their assets and took over the company. And within just a few months, I had turned it around.

A brush in it of itself isn’t ‘weird’ but the location of it was. My grandmother, whom I considered my best friend passed away when she was 92, nearly 93 in 2005. We were 63 years apart in age. She was soooo awesome though! She had class, style, elegance (always, going anywhere or just even staying home; she always looked good and smelled good). She brushed her beautiful mostly dyed brown hair with a streak of grey in it, with a very specific brush which frequently picked up the grey hair and there was her delightful smell.. She always seemed to smell like Vitabath (a fantastic bubble bath scent from decades ago) and Biotene, a type of mouthwash that she used then. I loved that woman so much and still think about her nearly every day. I celebrate her birthday (December 19th) trying to do things that she would enjoy, even if it’s just having specific foods in her honor, and think about her more than I already do. In about 2008 or 2009, my family and I were moving from our older small house to our newer larger house and I had the movers help me put all of the boxes my family and I gathered and taped shut, the furniture, everything and we were set to move from one house to the other. At that time, no one had a key to the house other than me (because the locks were changed and I was the only person with the key). A few days prior, there was not a single thing in the house and I know because I checked (everywhere: the cabinets, shelves, closets, bathrooms, laundry room, etc.). I arrived to the house about 30 minutes before the movers to think and try to decide what rooms were going to be whose and also asked in my mind and out loud if my grandmother would’ve liked the house. I walked up the stairs and oddly started to smell my grandmother when she smelled really good like after one of her bubble baths. The closer I got to where I decided would be my bedroom (and my closet), the stronger her smell was and I opened the closet door and right there on the only shelf was a singular object: Her brush. I knew it was her brush because it had her grey hairs in it and it smelled exactly like her. It was then that I knew that she was happy that I had bought this house and that she felt it was suitable for me (and for her peace of mind which I knew then too, she had). It wasn’t exactly “weird” but it struck me as odd and probably at least one if not the most interesting odd object I’ve seen."},{"instruction":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","output":"here are the steps to learn cooking: Start with basic recipes: Start by learning basic recipes that are easy to make and include simple ingredients.

In most cases, Canadian health care would probably want people to see doctors more often for preventative type care — health, fitness, mammograms, yearly checkups, shots, etc. However, assuming someone tried this. Appointments. Non-emergency doctors run private practices. They may not be able to see new patients and existing patients have to set appointments. This could be weeks or months in some places to see your doctor.Hospitals and Clinics. If you show up at an emergency room or a clinic without any issues… you are treated in terms of priority. Depending on where you go, you could wait the entire day and not see a doctor. Few sane people want to sit in an ER room for eight hours.Referrals. You can’t make appointments with specialists or for any procedure. These need to be arranged through a GP first. So… all you can get is maybe 15 minutes of a general doctor’s time. They can look at you, look at your history, don’t see anything and that’s pretty much it. The aren’t going to run you through an MRI, see a specialist, etc.Medial Tracking. Each province maintains records for patients across the province. If you see a doctor they (or typically their receptionist) can look up all your visits. In practice, after a half-dozen repeated “no issue” visits someone is going to flag you and folks are going to know. They might still meet you if they aren’t doing anything.Physiocratic Services. If repeated visits happen too often, a doctor can refer you to mental health specialists.It’s cheap. Doctors in most provinces are billing maybe 70-100 per fifteen minute visit. Even if you managed two bogus appointments per month for a year before someone flags you for mental health help… that is still under 2,000 per year. It is a faction of the national average and such a tiny drop vs. people who don’t see a doctor and develop really serious issues. If one in a thousand or ten thousand people have such mental health issues to go through the trouble of getting a 15 minute appointment, it isn’t financially going to strain the system vs. even one guy who keeps putting off a prostrate exam and then the added cost of dealing with late term cancer or something."},{"instruction":"Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes.

This is because the language of first-order graph theory consists only of predicates, variables, and logical connectives, and does not include the concept of a graph being connected. However, we can still try to express the idea of a graph being connected using the predicates and logical connectives available in the language of first-order graph theory. One way to do this is to define a predicate \\"Connected(x,y)\\" that is true if there is a path in the graph from node x to node y. We can then use this predicate to express the idea that the graph is connected by saying that for any two nodes x and y in the graph, there is a path from x to y. However, this formula is not logically equivalent to the statement \\"G is connected.\\" This is because the formula only states that there is a path between any two nodes in the graph, but it does not capture the idea that the graph is one continuous whole. For example, a graph could have two separate connected components, but the formula would still be true because there is a path between any two nodes in the graph. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement \\"G is connected\\" is not equivalent to any sentence in first-order graph theory."},{"instruction":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","output":"For a variety of reasons, including lack of support, financial reliance, emotional attachment, fear, or guilt, people remain in toxic or abusive relationships.
