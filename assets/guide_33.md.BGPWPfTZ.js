James Bond is assigned to aid the defection of a KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov, covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia during intermission. During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain. In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, \\"Smiert Spionam\\". Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskov's entire defection was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond visits the Prater to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskov's henchman Necros, who again leaves the...","output":"The solo cellist in the film \\"The Living Daylights\\" is Kara Milovy. As the movie's plot suggests, she is not simply a minor character but plays a crucial role, showing that she unusually draws the intrigue of the protagonist, James Bond. Kara Milovy, portrayed by actress Maryam d'Abo, is a talented cellist, part of the orchestra performing at a concert in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. In a twist of events, she is forced by the KGB to act as a sniper to prevent the defection of KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov. However, Bond, noticing that the alleged sniper is the cellist, disobeys his orders to kill the sniper and instead saves her by shooting the rifle out of her hands. This act becomes the starting point of their ensuing relationship and propels the movie's plot. Interestingly, Bond later discovers that Milovy is in fact, Koskov's girlfriend, further complicating the relationship between the main characters. As the narrative unfolds, Bond convinces Kara that he is an ally and persuades her to accompany him on his mission. In terms of a film investment perspective, it's worth noting that the introduction of a charismatic figure like Kara Milovy can add to the movie's appeal. Her character provides an emotional subplot that complements the espionage action, drawing in audiences who appreciate romantic tension alongside the usual Bond thrills. However, it's also important to consider other factors beyond the plot such as who is in the production team, the budget, potential actors, expected return on investment, and the historical financial performance of similar movies. Whether the film resonates with current social, cultural, and market trends or whether it's a sequel or part of a well-known franchise like James Bond, which has a dedicated fan base, are also critical aspects when making a decision on investing in a film proposal. You’ll also need to consider your own tolerance for risk, as film investing can be speculative and returns are not guaranteed. Thus, thorough analysis and due diligence are essential.  In conclusion, although the character of Kara Milovy enhances the narrative of \\"The Living Daylights\\" with intrigue and emotional depth, a comprehensive investment decision should rely on many factors beyond individual characters in the film's plot."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you do not use your arms or your legs some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again.

Background: Sherlock Holmes () is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a \\"consulting detective\\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Context: Details about Sherlock Holmes's life, except for the adventures in the books, are scarce in Conan Doyle's original stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.  An estimate of Holmes's age in \\"His Last Bow\\" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his \\"ancestors\\" were \\"country squires\\". In \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without further clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official who appears in \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", \\"The Final Problem\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\" and is mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlock's interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.  Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession, and he spent six years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept John H. Watson as a fellow lodger in 1881 (when the first published story, A Study in Scarlet, begins).  The two take lodgings at 221B Baker Street, London, an apartment at the upper (north) end of the street, up seventeen steps. Question: Did he refer to his brother in his stories? Answer:","output":"Yes, Sherlock Holmes refers to his brother, Mycroft Holmes, in several of his stories. Mycroft appears in \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", \\"The Final Problem\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\". He is also mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\".

Step 2: Prepare the bread Take the bread and cut it into cubes or tear it into small pieces. If the bread is too fresh, let it dry out for a few hours or toast it slightly in the oven. This will help the bread better absorb the liquid mixture in later steps. Step 3: Mix wet ingredients In a large bowl, combine milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk everything together until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is homogeneous. Step 4: Flavor the mixture (optional) Add any additional desired ingredients such as raisins, cinnamon, or nutmeg to the liquid mixture and stir well. Step 5: Soak the bread Add the bread pieces to the liquid mixture, ensuring that all pieces are evenly coated. Let the bread soak in the mixture for at least 15-30 minutes.

Review title: Clancy sinks himself Product review: I can't believe how poor this \\"novel\\" is. SSN is totally devoid of character development - the writer (which was probably not Clancy) did not even bother to name the Cheyenne's officers. Dialogue and action were monotonous (open doors one and two...), and featured the Cheyenne single-handedly annihilating the entire Chinese navy.I now know that it was meant to be a guide for the SSN computer game.

A:","output":"Upon reading this review, my step-by-step analysis is as follows: 1. Identify the overall sentiment: The reviewer seems to be quite displeased with the product, as can be seen from phrases like \\"can't believe how poor this 'novel' is\\" and \\"STAY FAR AWARE!\\" This indicates a negative review. 2. Look at specific criticisms: The reviewer provides particular points of dissatisfaction, such as lack of character development, monotonous dialogue, and action. They also emphasize that it should not be a standalone read. 3. Consider reviewer's credibility: Although the reviewer seems to be a fan of Clancy (the product's author), their dissatisfaction with this specific product is evident. 4. Weigh review against your preferences: It's necessary to consider how much you value the aspects criticized in the review, such as character development and engaging dialogue. Based on the negative tone and specific criticisms in the review, it would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, especially if I value those aspects (character development, engaging dialogue) in a novel.

Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\").

Article:","output":"Title: Former Editor, Coulson, Admits to Phone Hacking and Regrets Treatment of Labour Politician In a recent revelation, it has come to light that an exposed affair between former prominent Labour politician, David Blunkett, and publisher Kimberley Fortier, was uncovered using unethical means.  46-year-old former newspaper editor, Coulson, admitted during a hacking trial that he had learned about the illicit liaison after illicitly accessing and listening to voicemails, which is a form of phone hacking. This invasion of privacy has led to charges against the former editor, for conspiring to hack phones. The affair between Blunkett and Fortier, which took place in 2004, was exposed by the editor, leading to significant personal and political fallout for the involved parties. While Coulson now admits his wrongdoing and expresses regret for his treatment of the Labour politician, the damage has been done, and the ongoing trial aims to shed light on the extent of the unethical practices employed by the editor and his accomplices. The admission of guilt by Coulson plays an essential role in understanding the prevalence of phone hacking among media professionals, and the invasion of privacy undertaken in the pursuit of stories. The case raises questions about the ethical responsibilities of journalists and media organizations and serves as a sobering reminder that the thirst for sensationalism can sometimes lead to severe consequences for both the subjects of news articles and the reporters responsible for them. As the trial continues, more details are expected to emerge, painting a clearer picture of the extent to which personal information was accessed and used to fuel the media's appetite for scandal and expose. In a world where the delicate balance of public interest and private lives is ever evolving, this case will undoubtedly serve as a crucial landmark in establishing the boundaries and responsibilities of those reporting the news around us."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will also notice the ocean floor is not flat. It too has many Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old. Ocean basins may only be millions of years old. Because the continents are so old, a lot has happened to them! As we view the land around us, we see landforms.

In Hindi, it translates to \\"बदइबारत\\" (badibarat). - You: The pronoun \\"you\\" refers to the person being addressed, which in Hindi can be expressed as \\"आप\\" (aap). - Should: This modal verb indicates obligation, advisability, or expectation. In Hindi, it is often translated by using the appropriate verb form to convey the sense of \\"ought to\\" or \\"must.\\" - Give: The verb \\"give\\" means to present something to someone. In Hindi, it's \\"देना\\" (dena). - My: The possessive adjective \\"my\\" indicates ownership or relationship, which in Hindi is \\"मेरे\\" (mere). - Poor: The adjective \\"poor\\" in this context means lacking financial resources or being in need. In Hindi, it's \\"गरीब\\" (gareeb). - Boy: The noun \\"boy\\" refers to a male child or young man, which in Hindi can be expressed as \\"लड़का\\" (ladka) or \\"लड़के\\" (ladke, as a vocative form). - A job: The phrase \\"a job\\" refers to a form of employment, which in Hindi can be translated as \\"नौकरी\\" (naukri).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology?, using the article: The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"William Etty is the artist whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology. In the context provided, Etty's painting \\"Musidora\\" is discussed, and it is mentioned that until then, his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It seems like they have paired down the menu a little so you are not bombarded with choices and can make up your mind a little easier. The staff is great and they seem like they genuinely want to take care of you and not in some fake way. My waitress was Lauren and she was helpful and very nice. Told us about the specials that we asked about and even made a special order drink that was technically not on the menu.  The bread was very good and they even add Parmesan cheese in a little pile on the side of the usual oil and vinegar blend. Sure the food took a little longer to come out but you know it is being made fresh and by someone who cares how it comes out. Plus you can see right into the kitchen so you know there are no microwaves. I ordered the Linguine with white clam sauce. Now normally I am more of a fan of cream sauces vs wine sauces but this was really good. Lots of clams cooked just right none of them were tough.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

There are many great movie directors of all time and the following are five of those who have largely impressed audience with their body of work.  As a member of the New Hollywood gang, Francis Coppola is best remembered for The God Father series. His decision to cast Marlon Brando in the lead also met with fierce opposition from the studio bosses. Good sense became popular, and The God Father went on to become one of the most memorable movies ever. Critics may point out that he has become less creative after his seventies, but try as one might, no one can possibly take the place of this great director's work.  Stanley Kubrick's movies focus on the themes like sci-fi, horror, dark humor and war. He used symbolism in most of his movies, giving us some wonderful screen visuals, as shown in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His actors in Hollywood complained about the endless number of retakes, but they appreciated the performance he milked out of them. People argue about films like Lolita, A Clockwork Orange and Paths of Glory, but these are now seen as classics.  Steven Spielberg is a great success at the box office, and he is one of the world's most popular filmmakers today. As the creator of classics like Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, ET, Indiana Jones series, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, no one can win his hold over the audience. His critics accuse him of being emotional and over the top, _  Woody Allen is a director who directs movies full of crime and hate. This comic genius has given us Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris, which have also become classical. His movies constantly include characters who arouse the audience's sympathy and laughter at the same time, as they set out on a journey of self-discovery. Hollywood star power has never fazed Allen. Thankfully, awards and honors do not interest him, which results in creativity that is original. 1. Who is remembered for the Godfather? 2. What was his occupation? 3.

But I can use this background: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Paragraph: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Here is a question about this article: Since the end of the World Wars, the term \\"great power\\" has been joined by a number of other power classifications. Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower, used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world. It was first coined in 1944 by William T.R. Fox and according to him, there were three superpowers: the British Empire, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.[nb 2] The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence, but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs. Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world. What is the answer to this question: What are middle powers?","output":"Middle powers are countries that hold a moderate degree of global influence and play a significant role in international affairs, yet their capabilities and presence are not large or dominant enough to be considered superpowers or great powers. These nations typically possess a sizable economy, maintain a stable political system, and have the ability to influence decisions and outcomes within their region and on the international stage to some extent. However, they lack the comprehensive reach, economic, military, and diplomatic dominance that the term superpower conveys. While middle powers may not possess overwhelming strength or control over global affairs, they often use their influence and resources to advocate for multilateralism, conflict resolution, and the promotion of international norms and values. For instance, middle powers are known to engage in diplomacy through international organizations, peacekeeping missions, and development aid, thereby fostering a rules-based international order. Their involvement in such activities illustrates their commitment to global stability and collaboration, even though they cannot singlehandedly shape the course of world events. Some examples of middle powers include countries like Canada, Australia, South Korea, Sweden, and Brazil. These nations actively participate in global affairs through membership in international organizations, promotion of diplomatic initiatives, and contribution to economic development and humanitarian aid. Their efforts and presence in the international arena not only enable them to maintain a degree of power and influence but also demonstrate their responsibility and commitment to the global community. In summary, middle powers are countries that exert significant influence in international affairs yet lack the widespread dominance of great powers or superpowers. These countries utilize their resources and capabilities to engage in diplomacy, conflict resolution, and the promotion of international norms and values, thus contributing to the overall stability and collaborative global environment."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Next question: what is the name of an australian wasp?","output":"There are several species of wasps native to Australia, with one of the most well-known and commonly-found being the European Wasp (Vespula germanica). However, this species is not originally from Australia but rather an invasive species that was introduced.  For a truly native Australian wasp, the Hairy Flower Wasp (Scolia soror) is a suitable example. This wasp species is well-adapted to the Australian environment and plays an important role in the ecosystem. Here is a detailed overview of the Hairy Flower Wasp: 1. Appearance: Hairy Flower Wasps are large, robust, and brightly colored. They have a predominantly blue-black hue with distinctive yellow or orange markings on their body. As their name suggests, their bodies are covered in fine hairs that provide them with a somewhat fuzzy appearance. Adult Hairy Flower Wasps measure from around 20 to 30 millimeters in length. They have prominent wings that can be visibly folded lengthways and are either transparent or slightly smoky-colored.  2. Distribution: The Hairy Flower Wasp can be found throughout Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. They inhabit a variety of environments, including forests, grasslands, suburban gardens, and open areas. 3. Life cycle and habits: Hairy Flower Wasps are solitary creatures, with females often seen flying low to the ground, searching for nectar-rich flowers and the grubs of the scarab beetle. Unlike many other wasps who live in colonies, the Hairy Flower Wasp does not build paper nests. Instead, they burrow into the ground to locate their prey. 4. Diet and predation: Adult Hairy Flower Wasps are pollinators that primarily feed on nectar from flowers. However, the female wasps play a crucial role in controlling scarab beetle populations by hunting the beetle grubs. The female wasp will dig into the ground to locate the grub, then paralyze it by injecting venom through her stinger. After she lays an egg on the paralyzed grub, the wasp larva will hatch and consume the beetle grub as it matures before pupating and eventually emerging as an adult wasp. This predatory behavior helps to keep the beetle population in check in a natural and sustainable way. 5. Interaction with humans: Although Hairy Flower Wasps possess a stinger, they are not aggressive toward humans and only sting in self-defense or when provoked. Their sting can be quite painful, but it is not life-threatening unless the victim is allergic to wasp stings. These wasps are generally considered beneficial insects, as they help control pest populations and contribute to the pollination of flowers. On a broader note, Australia is home to an incredible diversity of wasp species, including the potter wasp, spider wasp, and various parasitic wasp species. Each of these native Australian wasps has unique habits and biological characteristics, making them an essential part of the continent's ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor. Scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. Calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in Dubai. Scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose first venture was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public?  The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was  written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany.  When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill –  the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the  early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music  changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\".  In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and  masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

Here's the problem: 0 = -651*q + 677*q - 156. Let me help you understand how to find the answer. First, let's take a look at the two q terms we have: -651*q and 677*q. We can add them together.  When we do that, it becomes: 0 = (677-651)*q - 156.  Calculating the difference of 677 and 651, we get 26. So now the problem looks like this: 0 = 26*q - 156. We want to isolate \\"q\\" and find its value. To do that, let's add 156 to both sides of the equation. When we do that we get:  156 = 26*q. Now, we want to find out what q is.

Question: What may be a fact about the speaker 's situation ?","output":"Based on the speaker's statement, it can be deduced that they feel deeply hurt and undervalued in their relationship. This feeling could have arisen from various factors, which could include trust issues, unmet expectations, poor communication, or even mistreatment. One possible fact about the speaker's situation is that they may have been involved in a romantic relationship where there was an imbalance of power and emotional investment. The speaker indicates that they \\"truly loved\\" their partner, which suggests a strong emotional attachment on their part. However, they also mention feeling like an \\"old toy,\\" which implies that they perceive themselves as treated without respect or care for their feelings. Another possible fact is that the speaker's partner has ended their relationship in a cold or dismissive manner, without providing the desired closure in the form of a face-to-face conversation. This might be a source of deep emotional pain for the speaker, as they feel discarded and abandoned. The mention of their partner \\"throwing them back at their parents\\" might indicate that the speaker's family could be involved in the situation, which could further exacerbate their feelings of embarrassment, humiliation or simply having been used or betrayed. Another fact that can be inferred from the speaker's statement is the existence of unresolved feelings and lack of closure in their relationship. The speaker clearly seeks answers and validation through a face-to-face conversation, a chance to address the issues and possibly rebuild their emotional connection. The fact that their partner seems unwilling or unable to provide this may further contribute to the speaker's feelings of hurt and betrayal. Additionally, the speaker's doubt about their partner's love and care for them might hint that this is not the first time their partner has dismissed their feelings or acted in such an indifferent manner. This could be a pattern of behavior in their relationship, with the speaker experiencing feelings of neglect or being taken for granted multiple times. In conclusion, based on the speaker's statement, it can be inferred that they are in a painful situation stemming from a disintegrated relationship, the absence of proper closure, and continuous disregard for their feelings by their partner. Their desire for a face-to-face conversation indicates an attempt to seek answers, clarity, and possibly healing from this emotionally distressing situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

England's star performer Tom Wood admitted defeat was not good enough. Ben Smith was exception in defence and attack for New Zealand.","output":"Title: England Rugby Team Fights for Revival as New Zealand Shines England rugby team's recent clash with New Zealand proved to be an intense and hard-fought battle. Both the opponent's exceptional players had moments of brilliance. However, this high stakes encounter also revealed several areas in which England must improve if they are to truly compete with the world's finest rugby teams. In this article, we'll examine how England can learn from this encounter and bounce back stronger than ever. One of the most notable talking points from the match was the performance of Manu Tuilagi. Known for his raw power and game-changing abilities, Tuilagi failed to make a significant impact playing on the wing. While he possesses undeniable talent, it became evident that his skills would be better utilized in the central positions. By moving back inside, Tuilagi can exploit gaps in the opposition defense and create opportunities for his fellow teammates. England's star performer in the match, Tom Wood, admitted that defeat to New Zealand was not good enough and that they must learn from their mistakes. In a post-game interview, Wood admitted that the team has a long way to go before they can stand toe-to-toe with rugby's elite teams. This candid admission highlights the need for the squad to rally, train, and prepare for the future, as they work to achieve the high standards of performance that their dedicated fanbase rightfully expects. On the other side of the pitch, Ben Smith was a key player in New Zealand's impressive performance, excelling in both defense and attack. Smith's composure under pressure, coupled with his ability to read the game and make crucial decisions, helped his team outmaneuver England throughout the match. His performance serves as a reminder that rugby success is about more than raw skill; mental toughness, determination, and tactical acumen also play a vital role. To emerge stronger from this defeat, England must take heed of these lessons and focus on improving their overall performance. For starters, recognizing the need to adapt their squad's formation is essential in better utilizing a player like Tuilagi's strengths. Additionally, improving mental resilience, staying focused during high-pressure moments, and honing game strategies are crucial for the team's future success. Moreover, England must learn from the tireless efforts of their opposition. Ben Smith's outstanding performance underlined the importance of a well-rounded player – someone who excels both on the offense and the defense. England must strive to cultivate such players within their ranks to elevate the team's capabilities. In conclusion, England's recent defeat to New Zealand provided several valuable lessons. From reassessing Manu Tuilagi's position to focusing on mental fortitude and learning from top-performers like Ben Smith, the team must address these shortcomings and redouble their efforts to secure a brighter future. As Tom Wood admitted, the road to rugby success is long and filled with challenges, but with the right mindset and proper preparation, there's no reason why England can't rise to the occasion and compete at the highest level of the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I felt in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could hardly get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer  . He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him \\"Have you got a light?\\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile. I kept smiling at him, now considering him as a person and not just a jailer. \\"Do you have kids?\\" he asked. \\"Yes, here, here.\\" I took out my wallet and nervously felt the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes were filled with tears. I said that I was scared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell   and silently led me out and set me free. \\"My life was saved by a smile.\\" Yes, the smile--the unaffected, unplanned, natural relation between people. I really believed that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize   each other, we wouldn't be enemies. We couldn't have hate or scare. Question: The true statement of the following according to the passage is   _  . Options: A: when I was smiling to the jailer, he didn't smile B: the jailer was moved by what I said about my family and kids C: the jailer set me out of the jail as long as I kept silent over it D: if we could recognize each other, we must be good friends Answer:","output":"B: the jailer was moved by what I said about my family and kids"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Heavy metal pioneer At the Victoria & Albert museum in 1945, Sir Anthony Caro's great-uncle climbed on to a chair and staged an impromptu protest against the surrounding works - the Picasso and Matisse exhibition. \\"I am going to form a Society for the Sane in Art\\", he told the startled onlookers. His grand-nephew, who reveres Picasso above all other artists, with Matisse close behind, smiles at the recollection. \\"It wasn't uncommon then, that type of view. I mean, Alfred Munnings, who was head of the Royal Academy at the time, hated Picasso. He thought Cubism was madness. Most of the RAs did, I suppose.\\" Caro, who is honoured in his 81st year by a large retrospective at Tate Britain this month, is renowned, as Picasso was, for the range and versatility of his work. His readiness to experiment with hitherto unimagined forms, wrought from unlikely materials, has established him as a one-man sculptural avant-garde, constantly capable of changing the method and direction of attack. The art critic Clement Greenberg, chief promoter of American Abstract Expressionism, once wrote to Caro about a new set of his sculptures seen at Syracuse, New York: \\"I was overwhelmed by what you did... The recklessness of it... You are creating or recreating the medium.\\" By the time this letter was written, in 1980, Greenberg had been saying similar things to or about Caro for almost two decades. Caro does not come from an artistic or bohemian background, as his relative's outburst at the V&A would suggest. His father, Alfred, was a stockbroker in the City of London, descended from Sephardic Jews who came to England from Portugal in the mid-19th century. His mother Mary - his father's first cousin - was fond of making cushions, involving intricate appliqué, some of which her son has kept, but, he says, \\"she didn't encourage me to be an artist\\". The Caro family lived in a grand country house in Churt, Surrey. Alfred Caro would have liked his son to take a job in the City, like his own, \\"or at least to do something useful, like architecture or engineering\\". He viewed most art as dilettantism. By way of a compromise with his father's ghost, perhaps, Caro settled on an artistic medium that involves a great deal of hard graft, nowadays in a vast studio in Camden Town, north London, which was formerly a piano factory. Giant oxy-acetylene cylinders, welding masks, hoses, hammers and other items of industrial machinery crowd the floor. Heroic lumps of metal huddle about, outside and inside the studio, some of them partially crafted, others merely docile objects culled from scrapyards - grates, pitchforks, manhole covers, crane-hooks, a musical instrument or two - in the expectation of eventually being \\"found\\" in a Caro sculpture. Caro is stocky and compact, with an atmosphere of being perpetually at the ready. A stranger might take him initially for a retired military man of the most affable type. Caro's staff includes an engineer, Pat Cunningham, who has been with him for 35 years, and two young sculptural assistants, Hywel Livingstone and Ed Goolden, graduates of Winchester College of Art. Unlike many sculptors, Caro does not make preparatory drawings, or scale- model maquettes, but works directly from the material (he has a roomful of maquettes which, however, are made after completion of the piece itself). Much testing of formal arrangement goes on in the studio, with one of the assistants lifting things and putting them in place, only to readjust them once Caro has considered the result. At 80 years of age, he is still actively involved in the manual construction of his sculptures, a dozen of which are likely to be in progress at once. Caro has maintained the position of an outsider in British art. There is scant evidence in his astonishingly varied output - in metals, wood, clay, ceramic, even paper - of cross-fertilisation with other home-grown sculptors such as Eduardo Paolozzi or Elisabeth Frink, or with \\"sculptural\\" painters such as Lucian Freud or Frank Auerbach. He claims not to feel like a European artist at all. \\"New York had more influence on me than Europe\\", Caro says. Dressed in a tweed jacket and striped shirt and tie, he is seated at a table between a large abstract painting by his wife, Sheila Girling, and one of his own bronzes. \\"I used to visit the US very, very frequently, and we lived there for a couple of years, when we had a place in New York State. I would go and work over there three or four times a year. American art in those days, the 60s, was Abstract Expressionism and the early colour-field painters. It was very straightforward. It wasn't to be talked about in philosophical or Freudian terms. It was there, and you just had to say to yourself: 'Does it move me, does it touch me?' I really liked that.\\" Caro has always been more drawn towards the purely visual element in art than to what he refers to as \\"that sort of Surrealist orientation, that literary or poetic orientation. It was never easy for me to come to terms with the importance of ideas in art. I never felt comfortable with it. Even words like 'existentialism': I never really got to what all that meant. In the end, though, I like to think of myself as just a sculptor, not an English one or an American one or anything else.\\" Ian Barker, who has written widely on Caro's work and has recently published a lavishly documented and illustrated critical biography, Anthony Caro: Quest for the New Sculpture (Lund Humphries), says, \\"Caro is a revolutionary. He changed the face of British sculpture by engaging the spectator. He did this by taking the sculpture off the traditional plinth and placing it directly in the same space as the spectator - sculpture was no longer isolated from us. That approach has become so accepted today that it is almost commonplace.\\" Barker adds that \\"what we now call 'installation art' also stems from that act\\". The critic Tim Hilton, who has championed \\"the abundant beauty\\" of Caro's various styles over many years, has pointed out that \\"Caro's 1960s sculpture was the first, ever, whose entity simply cannot be indicated, nor even hinted at, by being drawn\\". After attending Charterhouse School and Cambridge, where he studied engineering, Caro served in the Royal Navy between 1944 and 1946. He then spent five years at the Royal Academy Schools, where teaching was closely focused on technique. As Barker puts it, \\"It was taken for granted that the students would aspire to make the same sort of art as those who taught them - in the case of sculptors, that meant architectural decoration or fountains or dignitaries on horseback\\". It was \\"quite late\\", Caro says, before he was able to commit himself to a career in art, \\"because my father was certain that I was not going to be an artist\\". As for the idea of making a rebellious break from his parents, he admits: \\"It never occurred to me. I wasn't a romantic. But after the Navy, my father said, 'Well, if you're going to do it, do it. But you'd better do it properly.'\\" In 1951, Caro made what was easily the boldest move of his life up to that point, when he approached Henry Moore at his studio in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, and asked to be allowed to work for him. \\"I just knocked on his door, really. He was wonderful. He was a very nice man, and very tolerant of the kid which I basically was. I learnt from watching him and talking to him. I think he recognised that I really loved art and that I was prepared to dedicate myself to it.\\" Caro's duties involved driving Moore to London on business, then taking him back to Perry Green in the evenings. \\"In the meantime, I would go and draw, and the next day he would look at my drawings and criticise them. It was a great privilege.\\" One drawing of a seated man by Caro, included in the Tate exhibition, has an annotation in the top right-hand corner by Moore, suggesting ways of giving the figure more weight. As Caro's assistants help in practical ways with his sculptures, so did he with Moore's, \\"with little bronzes and little waxes and so on. I wanted to get into his head, and he let me in. My job was not to contribute ideas. It was doing what he told me, but I tried to see how he was thinking, and to bring his things into reality in a rightful way.\\" He worked as Moore's assistant for over two years, before leaving \\"to develop his own identity as a sculptor\\", as Barker puts it. \\"The opportunity came when Frank Martin was appointed head of sculpture at St Martin's College of Art in London, and he invited Tony to do some teaching there.\\" By the end of the decade, Caro felt sufficiently his own man to mount a mild attack on his old mentor in the pages of the Observer: \\"When you try to think clearly about Henry Moore you are deafened by the applause... In his later works it sometimes appears that he is affected by a consciousness of his greatness.\\" After leaving Moore, Caro made large figurative sculptures in plaster and clay, sometimes cast in bronze, such as Man Holding His Foot, but he was changing his way of seeing. What are probably still his best-known pieces belong in a group that was exhibited at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963. It included Hopscotch and Early One Morning, exuberant assemblages of aluminium tube and sheet. The latter is painted red and incorporates a single \\"I\\" beam, of a kind that would become a characteristic presence in his work. The art critic and historian James Hall, author of The World as Sculpture, describes the work that appeared at the Whitechapel as \\"dandyish\\". He says, \\"it does seem extraordinary that Caro could take these 'I' beams and pieces of scrap metal and produce something so dainty and exquisite as Early One Morning \\". Michael Fried, the American writer who befriended Caro at the time and wrote the introduction to the catalogue of the Whitechapel show, says \\"Caro is an abstract sculptor, he thinks and imagines abstractly, which means you should approach his sculpture paying attention to a given piece's internal relations. Most of the time there is nothing like an overall image, just internal relations among parts, as in a piece of music.\\" In his Whitechapel essay, Fried wrote, \\"One can imagine a gifted dancer dancing Caro's sculptures.\\" Working more than ever in the US and teaching at Bennington College, Vermont, Caro struck up partnerships with the painters Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski, both of whom he cites as powerful influences. The leading avant-garde sculptor of the day - the only one to command the same sort of attention as painters such as Robert Motherwell, Morris Louis and Helen Frankenthaler - was David Smith, whom Caro admired, and with whom he sustained a tense friendship. \\"Moore was always guiding in one way or another, whereas Smith wanted to know if you were challenging him. He oughtn't to have been competitive with me, because when I met him I didn't come up to anywhere near his level.\\" Exposure to Smith's \\"constructed\\" or \\"cubist\\" sculptures set Caro off on another new adventure, and after Smith's death in a car accident in 1965 he made Homage to David Smith, containing allusions to the American artist's manner. Overall, he says, his relations with American sculptors, painters and even critics permitted him \\"a whole new way of thinking, a new way of tying your art and life together. They weren't afraid of daring to go to the edge of possibility.\\" Caro and his wife by then had two sons, and he was trying to balance the peripatetic life of a successful artist with the demands of domestic existence. \\"I remember Smith said, 'Put your art first. Everything you have, all your money, should go on your art.' He told me his wife had wanted a washing machine and he said she couldn't have it until he had got all the welding equipment he needed. The way those artists drove themselves to the edge was different from the way we did things in England.\\" Caro began to amplify his work to fit the wider spaces that became available in the US, whether a friend's barn or an open field. Barker says that Caro was \\"impressed by the daring of the Americans, by their confidence in the future, and their willingness to change when it was necessary to do so\\". Michael Fried feels that \\"England is a deeply inartistic culture as far as painting and sculpture are concerned. It's also a culture blind to abstrac tion in all its forms. America was where everything was happening, and when Caro went there in 1959 he was at the source. It was an extraordinary moment for American art, and in no time Caro was part of it. An amazing feat.\\" Caro himself introduced an important, American-inspired development into his way of working. \\"When I had my Whitechapel exhibition in 1963, Ken Noland said, 'Why do you put so much into one sculpture? Why not work through a series of sculptures and let them develop from each other?' He had learnt that from David Smith. And that friendly openness is very fertile. But not everybody does it.\\" Caro had his first large-scale exhibition in the US at the Gallery of Modern Art in Washington DC in 1965. A decade later, when the Museum of Modern Art staged a major retrospective, a writer in the New York Times described him as \\"the most remarkable sculptor to have appeared anywhere in the world during the past 25 years\\". Judging by the extensive correspondence published for the first time in Quest for the New Sculpture , the figure who exercised the greatest influence on Caro was neither a painter nor a sculptor but Clement Greenberg. In the 1950s, through his writings in journals such as Partisan Review, Greenberg exercised control over the New York art scene, and by extension modern art as a whole. Caro calls him \\"the most insightful person in the studio\\" that he has ever met. \\"We didn't talk about ideas, we talked about the work that was there. If I said to Clem, 'What would you think if I did this?', he would say, 'Make it and we'll see'. And then you'd show him something and he'd say, 'Great, but, you know, you don't need that stuff on the right side'. I've seen him go into people's studios and look at abstract work and say, 'Try it on its side'. He always found something to say. He once went into someone's studio with Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, and they came out without saying a word. Clem was furious. He felt you should never go into someone's studio without saying something about what you've seen.\\" Caro is attached to the notion of interdependence between artists and critics, and is disappointed that British critics seem less eager to get involved with an artist's work while it is in the making. \\"I think that critics here hardly ever go to studios. They only see the finished work and then they pass judgment. And that seems to me a fairly unhelpful thing to do. I've always believed that I'm going to gain a lot from a different pair of eyes. I've liked it when friends who are painters have come in and told me what they think.\\" His wife paints in a studio in a building adjacent to his. \\"She comes over very often, or I go up to her studio, and she says, 'What do you think of this?' We talk about art all the time, we thrash out ideas together.\\" If Caro were to stumble into the studios of certain younger British artists, he would offer critical comments, but they might not be favourable. \\"Some of the stuff that's called art is just damned stupid. I mean, 'That glass of water's an oak tree' kind of thing. I think you should say, 'What are the limits of sculpture? Let's see if we can change the area a little bit.'\\" Of Marcel Duchamp, recently voted the most influential artist of the 20th century in a survey of artists, critics and dealers, Caro says, \\"I think that Duchamp, and later Joseph Beuys, did a great deal of harm. Duchamp was having a joke and it's been taken seriously.\\" He and Sheila Girling met at the RA Schools and married in December 1949. She paints regularly, \\"but when she had the children she gave up for a few years and devoted her time to them and her artistic side to me. It's been incredibly generous. I couldn't do without her - from a human point of view, obviously, but also from a critical point of view. It's a marvellous partnership.\\" It was a sense of responsibility towards his family, Ian Barker says, \\"and principally to his children's education, that prevented him moving permanently to the US when he had the opportunity to do so\\". One son, Tim, now in his 50s, lives in California where he is a scientist specialising in animal behaviour. The couple's younger son, Paul, is a painter in London. Together they have brought the Caros three grandchildren which Sir Anthony describes as \\"an absolute delight\\". In 1980, while visiting Tim in Africa, where he had gone to study cheetahs, Caro established a project to assist the Federated Union of Black Artists (FUBA) in Johannesburg, persuading 90 painters and sculptors to contribute work - Moore, Noland, Frank Stella and Richard Diebenkorn among them. The collection was first displayed in Cape Town and other cities, and then donated to FUBA to help set up what Caro, in a letter to Greenberg, called \\"a sort of ICA out there\\". A typical, and to Caro highly important, precept of Greenberg's was, \\"If you want to change your art, change your habits\\". The motto might as well hang above the door to his studio. An innovative way of firing clay, or an unthought-of method of casting bronze, can inspire a new set of experiments. \\"You are talking to the material, you're talking to the sculpture as it emerges, and you somehow have to get on track with it. It's a dialogue. You can do things in steel that you can't do in clay, or in bronze. Each material demands a different sort of thing.\\" Found objects also talk to him. \\"But you have to be careful, because the best ones are usually the ones that are so complete in themselves that they don't want any attention. I've been to scrapyards and said, 'Oh look at that, we must have that'. And that's the one you can't do anything with because it's too much there already. Its character doesn't allow any opening for you.\\" Caro's dramatic group work, The Trojan War, came out of experiments conducted in the workshop of the ceramicist Hans Spinner, near Grasse in the south of France. When Caro first arrived, Spinner expected to place himself at the service of the sculptor. \\"We went down to the studio and I said, 'what would you like to do?' He looked at me and said, 'you do something'. I discovered at that moment that Tony likes accidents. I said, 'what colour do you want?' And he replied, 'just fire it and we'll see what happens.'\\" Caro himself adds: \\"When I go to a new place, I let it speak to me and hope that something's going to come about. It's the same as when I first went to a steelyard and found that the chap with the crane could do things that I couldn't have imagined doing, because he could lift up three tons without a thought.\\" The repeated complaint about Caro's work is its want of emotion. While some commentators have rejoiced in his persistent habit of \\"getting into a problem\\" only to sculpt his way out, others have been left cold. James Hall believes that \\"the Achilles heel of Caro's work is surely its lack of passion\\". Hall admires what he calls the \\"early classical, painted sculptures\\" - Early One Morning, Prairie and others - but feels that \\"the momentum of Caro's work began to slide as early as 1967\\". Reviewing a Caro show in 1981 at the gallery of Caro's dealer, Annely Juda Fine Art, Hall wrote, \\"Too often there is a sense of going through the motions, of offering acrobatic formal solutions without first identifying the problems\\". Hall thinks that working with welded metal, using found objects, as Caro does, \\"means that he produces incredibly fast, and he appears never to throw anything away\\". In the late 1970s, Caro developed something he called \\"sculpitecture\\", which involved making architectural towers that viewers were invited to climb inside. These were dismissed by the critic of the Evening Standard, Brian Sewell, as \\"monstrous trivialities\\". Barker contends that objections based on a lack of emotion \\"could not be further from the truth. With The Last Judgment I witnessed people weeping after seeing it for the first time when it was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1999. It is hard to imagine a more passionate reaction than that.\\" In recent years, the relentless abstraction of Caro's work has yielded to an increased political content. It has been expressed in group works such as The Last Judgment and The Barbarians, which comprises a battalion of soldiers on junk-yard horses, as well as The Trojan War. In addition, there are free-standing sculptures such as Witness, a massive maternal figure brought low by the anguish of war, made from clay at Spinner's workshop in Provence. Some critics have discussed these narrative works in purely artistic terms - \\"Fashion has swung back to the figurative, and here Caro is up to his old tricks, in touch but on his own track\\", John McEwen wrote of The Trojan War - but the artist himself talks about them more bluntly: \\"Politics suddenly came into my work. I'm disgusted by the way things are happening. I think that Bush and Blair are war criminals. I wouldn't shake hands with Blair if I had the opportunity to do it. He has no honour at all. I found myself getting intimate with politics with The Trojan War. But what is the narrative about? Is it about the Trojan War or is it about the Kosovan war? It's difficult to know. I think it probably went over the top a bit in The Barbarians. I don't want to preach. But I'm angry.\\" When it comes to the milder, ongoing culture wars, Caro is more restrained. He visited Greece for the first time only in 1985, and was profoundly impressed by the appearance of ancient sculpture and architecture in the Mediterranean light. \\"Later on, I had a show of The Trojan War there and they said, 'Give us back our Elgin Marbles'. I don't have a strong opinion about it, in terms of morality, but I would be frightened that they would not be taken sufficient care of. And besides I want to be able to see them! Should everything go back where it came from? Should all those Botticellis go back to Italy? We can learn from them if they're here. Basically, I love the idea of the universality of art.\\" In one of the anterooms to Caro's studio, there is a complete model of the Tate exhibition, constructed in miniature by the sculptor Jaana Fowler, each piece meticulous in its detail and colour. It is spread out across a large table, like a model train set. Leaning over the roofless gallery outline, dipping his hand in to shift a tiny red or yellow sculpture a centimetre to the left or the right, Sir Anthony takes on the aspect of a genial Apollo, gazing down on the puzzling inventions of mankind: Sun Feast; Buddha Lemon; Red Splash; The Last Judgment. He is afraid that the show might be felt by viewers to be too big. \\"I don't want them to get tired. Also it's rather expensive for young people. I'm pleased that they've given me such a lot of space, but they should serve coffee in the middle of it all.\\" Born: March 8, 1924, New Malden, Surrey.

I used to worry so much about it,\\" said Vera, \\"I wouldn't know what to do without him. If he left I wouldn't know how to run his business.\\" Now Vera and Lucio, whose last names we've agreed to withhold to protect their identity, are entering that system, hopeful that they won't be separated. Come March, many mixed-status families will breathe a sigh of relief knowing they won't have to remain separate for a long period of time while they apply to become legal residents in the U.S., according to a new rule made by the Department of Homeland Security announced last week. The new rule does not guarantee legal status to the undocumented immigrant -- the family still has to prove that the deportation of the spouse or parent would cause \\"extreme hardship\\" to the U.S. citizen. \\"I'm so relieved he gets to stay here while we go through this process, it makes a big difference,\\" Vera said. Sarah Monty, Lucio's immigration lawyer, is optimistic that his waiver will be approved. USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release: \\"The law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to U.S. citizens, which is precisely what this rule achieves.\\" \\"The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon.\\" Under current law, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who are not eligible to adjust status in the U.S. to become lawful permanent residents must leave the country and obtain an immigrant visa in their home country. Those who have accrued more than six months of unlawful presence while in the United States must obtain a waiver to overcome the unlawful presence bar before they can return to the U.S. after departing to obtain an immigrant visa. \\"This final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa,\\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in a press release. Monty fears that because the eligibility is so specific to a certain group of people, many undocumented immigrants are going to be confused as to why they do not qualify and suggests they seek out legal counsel. She said the new regulation was a huge step forward and sadly long overdue. Undocumented immigrants married to a U.S. citizen are the most vocal group said Monty, and if this provision works, this might extend to other groups. The new rule does not apply to U.S. children with an undocumented parent. In other words, you cannot give birth to your own waiver. The child, whether undocumented or not, must have a U.S. citizen as a parent. A legitimate concern for many -- if the waiver is denied -- is that individuals are also putting the government on notice that an undocumented spouse or parent lives in the U.S. because it might put themselves at risk for deportation. \\"Applying for this waiver means that you are putting yourself out there. ICE told me that their priorities are to go after criminal aliens,\\" said Monty, but added, \\"Undocumented immigrants without a criminal history do not need to worry.\\" The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum applauds the Obama administration for their rule change. NAPAWF teamed up with the National Domestic Workers Alliance to advocate to keep women and their families together at the We Belong Together campaign. During the past two Christmases they organized thousands of letters from children to be sent to congress asking them to stop deporting their parents. \\"This is clearly a step in the right direction, but a lot more work needs to be done,\\" said Wida Amir, Immigrant Rights Program Director at NAPAWF in an interview, \\"We need a broader comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship. Congress needs to address the whole package.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Vera and Lucio, a mixed-status couple, may benefit from a new rule by the Department of Homeland Security that allows undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to apply for legal residency while remaining in the U.S. The couple must prove that deportation would cause \\"extreme hardship\\" to the U.S. citizen. This rule aims to reduce the time families are separated during the immigration process. However, it does not guarantee legal status and is specific to a certain group of people, prompting some to call for broader comprehensive immigration reform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A federal court jury in Florida convicted seven people of participating in a global child pornography trafficking enterprise, according to the Department of Justice. Jurors convicted the seven Wednesday of multiple counts of child exploitation, pornography and obstruction of justice. Members of the organization used Internet news groups to swap and share \\"illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts,\\" prosecutors said. An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. \\"My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,\\" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, \\"Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted.\\" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14. During the six-day trial, evidence showed the seven participated in what prosecutors called a \\"well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period.\\" \\"This was a wide-scale, high-volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,\\" Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general, said in the statement. The seven defendants were James Freeman of Santa Rosa Beach, Florida; Gary Lakey of Anderson, Indiana; Marvin Lambert of Indianapolis, Indiana; Neville McGarity of Medina, Texas; Warren Mumpower of Spokane, Washington; Daniel Castleman of Lubbock, Texas; and Ronald White of Burlington, North Carolina, according to the Department of Justice.

Question 2: Were Hitler's family Nazis? Available choices: [a]. no; [b]. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are distinctly different queries regarding aspects of Hitler's life and the Nazi regime. Question 1 asks about Nazi artifacts that were discovered in Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest,\\" otherwise known as the Kehlsteinhaus, located in the Bavarian Alps. It's about actual physical objects or remnants related to the Nazi regime that have historical value. It also asks how much these artifacts were sold for, encouraging a discussion about their market or auction value. The artifacts discovered over the years are quite varied. While the specific items can vary, they often include things like personal belongings, parts of uniforms or decorations, ornate furniture, silverware, fine china, and numerous other items associated with Hitler and his close associates. The value of these artifacts can vary wildly and is typically determined by factors like historical significance, condition, rarity, and provenance. In recent years, ethical concerns arisen about the sale of Nazi artifacts, with many auction houses choosing to forego these sales entirely. Question 2, on the other hand, refers to Adolf Hitler's family and whether they were Nazis. This question delves into the personal affiliations and beliefs of Hitler's immediate family members like his siblings, parents, and possibly extended family. There is evidence to suggest that some of Hitler's family members were indeed Nazis or Nazi sympathizers, while others were not. For example, Paula Hitler, Adolf's younger sister, was known to have similar political views, though she lived a largely private life. Conversely, Adolf's niece, Geli Raubal, is often thought to have been a victim of the regime, not a supporter. The answer to this question would be [b]. Yes, considering historical literature, some of his family members were Nazis. However, it is crucial to note that not all were documented as supporters or members of the Nazi party. Therefore, while both questions relate to Hitler and the Nazi era, they ask about distinctly different aspects: one about physical artifacts and their monetary value, the other about family ties and political affiliations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species; encouraging Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her. Later, he passes an intelligence test by a fluke and has sex with Partha.","output":"The men that fail the tests of the aliens in this article are Oliver and Cliff. Oliver is described as a mild-mannered professional who is engaged to Prudence, a highly-strung fiancée, while Cliff is a middle-aged man.

Fascinated by the human males' anatomy, the aliens decide to conduct a series of tests to learn more about their abilities, with the intention of selling them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet.

Willy beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, passes an intelligence test by a fluke, and even has sexual encounters with the aliens as they explore the human sexuality depicted in the adult magazines. In conclusion, Oliver and Cliff are the men who fail the aliens' tests while aboard the alien cargo ship, which might put them at risk of being sold to the distant zoo for exotic lifeforms.

By Hugo Gye PUBLISHED: 05:07 EST, 14 December 2012 | UPDATED: 09:53 EST, 14 December 2012 Will Self and Peter Hitchens clashed during an electric episode of Question Time last night as they expressed their strong views on the decriminalisation of drugs. The controversial author and former heroin addict told the Mail on Sunday journalist to 'take a chill pill' during their furious arguments on the BBC One programme. Mr Self, who once snorted heroin on the then-prime minister John Major's plane, argued that drug use should be legalised in order to focus on treating addicts. But Mr Hitchens responded that his claims were based on 'propaganda'. Mr","output":"Self, known for pushing societal boundaries through his writing and personal experiences, passionately advocated for the decriminalisation of drugs by drawing upon his own history as a former heroin addict. He reasoned that by legalising drug use, society would be able to better focus on treating addicts and addressing the root causes of addiction, rather than perpetuating the cycles of criminalisation and incarceration that are often seen with drug-related offences. Mr Hitchens, on the other hand, vehemently disagreed with Mr Self's assertions and claimed that such an approach would only serve to \\"normalize\\" drug use, leading to increased addiction rates and social decay. He accused Mr Self of basing his claims on \\"propaganda\\" spread by pro-drug groups, rather than on solid evidence or empirical research. As the debate continued to heat up, the sparks between Mr Self and Mr Hitchens grew even more intense. The live BBC One audience were captivated by the verbal battle, as both men presented their case. Mr Self argued that the current criminalisation of drugs only serves to create an illicit, underground market, which in turn leads to more crime, violence, and serious health consequences for users. He cited the successes of countries such as Portugal, which decriminalised drug possession and use in 2001, leading to a significant reduction in addiction rates, drug-related crime, and even drug-related deaths. By treating drug use as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one, Mr Self argued that society could focus on education, prevention, and rehabilitation, rather than relying on the punitive measures of the criminal justice system. In contrast, Mr Hitchens maintained that drug use is inherently destructive and that society must continue its efforts to prevent illegal drug use and punish those who choose to break the law. He cited examples of countries that maintain strict drug policies, such as Singapore, as evidence that a hardline approach can be effective in reducing drug use and the many social problems that come with it. As the heated discussion finally came to a close on that electric episode of Question Time, both Mr Self and Mr Hitchens demonstrated that although they might not agree on the issue of drug decriminalisation, their deep-rooted convictions and commitment to finding a solution for society's drug problem were undeniably powerful. Regardless of where one stands on this contentious issue, it was a debate characterised by intellectual rigor and fiery passion, sparking a much-needed conversation on how society can best address the longstanding and complex challenge that drug use and addiction present. As the polarising views of Mr Self and Mr Hitchens showed, finding a solution to this issue won't come easily, but it remains a critical area for policymakers and society to tackle in the ongoing pursuit of a safer, healthier, and more equitable world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969. Question: what happened to the zodiac killer Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided is not a direct or complete response to the question, \\"what happened to the Zodiac killer?\\" While your statement about the California Department of Justice maintaining an open case since 1969 is accurate, it doesn't specifically address what happened to the Zodiac killer because his identity remains unknown and there is no finality to his case. The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California for ten months in the late 1960s. His identity remains unknown to this day. He was given the name \\"Zodiac\\" in a series of taunting letters sent to local Bay Area press, which included four cryptograms, only one of which has been definitively solved. The Zodiac claimed to have committed 37 murders in letters sent to newspapers, but investigators agree only on seven confirmed victims, two of whom survived.   Despite numerous suspects over the years, the Zodiac Killer's case remains one of the most infamous unsolved cases in history and is still an open case in several jurisdictions, including the California Department of Justice. While several suspects have been named over the years, nobody has been definitively linked to the crimes either through direct physical evidence or conclusive circumstantial evidence. So, the question about what happened to the Zodiac killer remains unanswered completely."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The cost of sending a child to school has spiralled 27 per cent this year after a sharp rise in the price of uniforms and an increased demand for high-tech equipment. Parents will be forced to spend an average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 according to research by Santander credit cards. And the cost of daily essentials such as lunch, bus fares and school trips has also risen - by 13 per cent to £44. Earn to learn: The cost of sending a child to school has rocketed by 27% to £224 since 2012. The cost of the basic necessities - uniform, sports gear, books, stationery and technology - was found to be £210.31 for children at community schools pay. For children at Grammar schools the figure rose to £284.40, those at academies cost £242.59 and foundation or trust school pupils cost £276.20, the Daily Mirror reports. One reason why the costs has risen so dramatically is that more children are wanting to take high-tech equipment such as iPads and other electronic equipment into class. A recent study found that a typical schoolchild will carry a staggering £450 worth of stationary, books and gadgets in their bag. Many youngsters are now using expensive high-tech equipment such as iPads in class. A typical satchel costing £19.70 now contains a smartphone worth £362.10s and school books valued at £40.80. Parents also fork out £7.60 on food and drink, including a lunchbox, and spend £14 on stationary. The research shows children carry a pair of headphones in their rucksack as well, worth £5.80.And parents spend £100.80 pounds on their children's school uniform - bringing the total to a mighty £550.80. Matt Leeser, head of buying for communications technology at John Lewis, said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top 3 must-have school bag items for the last 50 years. 'But there's no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom. 'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years' time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today's digital natives grow up and become parents themselves. 'In the run up to back-to-school we're predicting we'll sell a computing device every two minutes during the two weeks over Bank Holiday.' On a national level the Britons now spend £2.3billion kitting their children out for class with an additional £447 million paid out for transport, food and outings. Department store John Lewis said children were more likely to want a tablet or e-reader than a geometry set. It was expecting to sell a hi-tech device like an iPad every two minutes over the Bank Holiday. Spokesman Matt Leeser said: 'There’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and the classroom.'","output":"This article is about how it costs more money for parents to send their kids to school now. The price went up 27% this year because uniforms are more expensive and kids need fancy technology like iPads for class. Parents have to spend about £224 now, compared to £177 in 2012. Other things like lunch, bus fares, and school trips also cost more now. Kids at different types of schools might have to pay different amounts, but all of them need more expensive things like iPads and smartphones in their school bags along with the usual pencils and books.

As the ice melts, it will cut through the creaminess of the drink which makes it taste better. If you don't have a cocktail shaker, place the cubes in a tall glass instead. Carefully measure out the Amarula and coconut water in a shot glass or jigger so that you use the proper amounts. If you'd rather have a citrus cocktail, replace the coconut water with a shot of Triple Sec instead.  You can also replace the coconut water with a shot of gin if you'd rather make a martini. If you want an even stronger cocktail, put 2 shots of Amarula in the drink. Vigorously shake the shaker to mix everything together and partially melt some of the crushed ice. This infuses the Amarula with the crushed ice. If you don't have a cocktail shaker, place the top of another glass into the glass with the Amarula so that it forms a seal. Then, hold both glasses together and shake the beverage to mix it. You don't have to strain the drink because it tastes great on ice. If you used Triple Sec instead of coconut water, garnish the drink with an orange peel to finish it off. Summary:","output":"To make a yummy Amarula drink, you need crushed ice, Amarula, and coconut water or other flavors like Triple Sec or gin.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the place that U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect?, using the article: Petrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north.  Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River., what would be the answer ?

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - Charleston is the oldest and second-largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, the county seat of Charleston County, and the principal city in the CharlestonNorth CharlestonSummerville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.  - The United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA or the Air Force Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census.  - A military academy or service academy (in \\"American English\\") is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps of the army, the navy, marine corps, air force or coast guard. It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel.

From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The Charleston Harbor is an inlet (8 sq mi/20.7 km²) of the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston, South Carolina.

Identify the main elements in the sentence. 2. Find the corresponding words in Romanian. 3. Adjust the word order according to the Romanian grammar rules. 4. Assemble the translated sentence. Step 1: Identify the main elements in the sentence. - \\"So\\" is a conjunction used to introduce a conclusion. - \\"I guess\\" is an expression used to express an opinion or belief. - \\"she is perfect\\" is the main statement, with \\"she\\" being the subject and \\"is perfect\\" acting as the predicate. - \\"for this European Union\\" is a prepositional phrase providing context for the main statement. Step 2: Find the corresponding words in Romanian. - \\"So\\" can be translated as \\"Deci\\". - \\"I guess\\" can be translated as \\"Presupun că\\". - \\"she\\" can be translated as \\"ea\\". - \\"is\\" can be translated as \\"este\\". - \\"perfect\\" can be translated as \\"perfectă\\". - \\"for\\" can be translated as \\"pentru\\". - \\"this\\" can be translated as \\"acest\\". - \\"European Union\\" can be translated as \\"Uniunea Europeană\\". Step 3: Adjust the word order according to the Romanian grammar rules. - Romanian follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. - In this sentence, \\"ea\\" (she) is the subject, \\"este\\" (is) is the verb, and \\"perfectă\\" (perfect) is the adjective. - The adjective \\"perfectă\\" should be placed after the noun \\"ea\\". - The prepositional phrase \\"pentru acest Uniunea Europeană\\" should remain the same as in English. Step 4: Assemble the translated sentence. The sentence in Romanian would be: \\"Deci, presupun că ea este perfectă pentru acest Uniunea Europeană.\\" So in Romanian, the sentence \\"So I guess she is perfect for this European Union\\" is translated as \\"Deci, presupun că ea este perfectă pentru acest Uniunea Europeană.\\""},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A new study from Carnegie Mellon University shows anger may help people reduce the negative impacts of stress and help you become healthier. \\"Here getting emotional is not bad for you if you look at the case of anger,\\" said Jennifer Lerner of Carnegie Mellon. \\"The more people display anger, the lower their stress responses.\\" Lerner studied 92 UCLA students by asking them to count back from 6,200. They must say out loud every thirteenth number. Researchers disturbed them by asking them to count faster or ask them other questions. If they made any mistakes, they had  to restart from the very beginning. Many students felt depressed about making so many mistakes or got angry because the researchers were interrupting them. Lerner used a hidden video camera and recorded all their facial expressions during the test. The researchers describe their reactions as fear, anger and disgust. Other researchers recorded the students' blood pressure, pulse and production of a high-stress hormone   called cortisol. People whose faces showed more fear during th e experiment had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone. Both can have lasting effects such as diabetes  , heart disease, depression and extra weight gain. When people feel fear, negative impacts increase, but when they get angry, those negatives go down, according to the study. \\"Having that sense of anger leads people to actually feel some power in what otherwise is maddening   situation,\\" Lerner said. Lerner previously studied Americans' emotional response to the 911 terrorist attacks two months after the incident. She found people who reacted with anger were more optimistic. These people are healthier compared with those who were frightened during the event. So in maddening situations, anger is not a bad thing to have. It's a healthier response than fear.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Depending on the symptoms, the doctor may need to run a few non-invasive imaging tests on the injured foot. The most common tests are x-rays, CT (Computerized Tomography) scans, and MRIs (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). These techniques allow the doctor to examine the foot for broken bones and monitor the bones as they heal. In many cases, surgery is not necessary for proper treatment of a broken foot. Often the hospital will put the foot in a hard cast and/or provide crutches to keep the weight off the foot. The doctor will likely advise you to keep the foot elevated and ice the injury to prevent swelling and re-injury.  When using crutches, put your weight on your arms and hands. Do not put all your weight on your armpits, which could hurt the nerves that are in your underarms. Follow your doctor's orders! Failure to comply with keeping your weight off the foot is the number one cause of delayed healing and re-injury for fractures. You may be advised to take over-the-counter NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflamatory Drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). These will help reduce the pain and swelling associated with the healing process.  If you are scheduled to undergo surgery you may need to stop taking medication a week before the surgery takes place. Consult with your doctor or surgeon.  Take the smallest dose possible to manage your pain. Stop taking NSAIDs after 10 days to avoid complications. Your doctor may also recommend upping your consumption of calcium and vitamin D, which are both crucial for bone health. For most foot injuries, your doctor will try to give your foot time to heal itself by putting on a cast and limiting your activity. In some cases, though, your injured foot may need a manipulation (known as an ORIF, or open reduction internal fixation) if the broken ends of the bone are misaligned. This involves the movement of the bone into the proper alignment, after which pins are passed through the skin to hold the bone in place while it heals. The healing process for a reduction takes an average of 6 weeks, after which the pins are easily removed. In more severe cases you may need surgery to implant screws or rods to keep the foot in position while it heals. Even if your injury doesn't require surgery, an orthopedic doctor or podiatric surgeon will be able to monitor the healing process. In the event of re-injury or other impairments to the healing process, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment, therapy, or surgery. Summary:","output":"If you hurt your foot, the doctor might use special pictures, like x-rays, to see if it's broken and decide the best way to help it heal, sometimes with a cast or maybe even surgery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222  August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258.  - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235  284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire.  - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.  - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD  22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.  - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261.  - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople.  - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.  - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek :    ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s .  - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223  11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire.  - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.  - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina ().  - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.    What entity does 'alexios strategopoulos' has the relation 'occupation' with? Answer:","output":"Alexios Strategopoulos had an occupation-related relationship with the Byzantine Empire, particularly during the reign of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. He served as a Byzantine general, rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar. Strategopoulos played a vital role in the reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, which led to the restoration of the Byzantine Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Standing up to watch football does not sound like a particularly revolutionary act, but a quarter of a century of anger, distrust and fear has turned it into one of the national game's most divisive issues. Appalled by the horrors of Hillsborough, and ashamed at the state of so many grounds, professional football did not put up much of an argument when Margaret Thatcher's government responded to the tragedy by banning standing areas. Even when this ban was later diluted to just the top two divisions in England and Wales, any nostalgia for football's most famous terraces was crowded out by the bottom line of greater ticket revenues. A consensus soon formed around the idea that all-seater stadia were easier to police, safer and more in line with what modern \\"consumers\\" wanted - the rising attendances, increased turnover and more diverse fan-base was the proof. So why do nine out of 10 football fans, in almost every survey, say they would like the choice to stand? Why are more clubs wondering if bringing back standing areas could help boost the atmosphere at games, as well as improving relations with those annoyed at being told what they cannot do and struggling to keep up with the game's gentrification? And why are so many experts coming around to the idea that bolting plastic seats to a concrete terrace does not have much impact on a human being's behaviour, or even the likelihood of injury? \\"The Hillsborough Independent Panel's report (in 2012) changed everything,\\" says Dr Geoff Pearson, an expert on the policing of football crowds at the University of Liverpool. \\"In many ways it didn't tell us anything we didn't already know from (Lord Justice) Taylor's 1990 report [into the disaster] but it confirmed that the reaction to Hillsborough was hijacked to bring in crowd-management and public order measures. \\"People were so shocked by the poor quality of most grounds they just didn't think standing could be done safely any more. We now know that's not true. Even Taylor didn't blame terracing.\\" The centrality of what happened on 15 April, 1989, to today's debate goes both ways, though. Steve Rotheram, the MP for Liverpool Walton, speaks for many on Merseyside when he says \\"safe-standing is an oxymoron\\", and suggests those 96 lives would not have been lost if there were seats in the Leppings Lane Stand that day. The emotions are still so raw at Anfield that Liverpool were the only Premier League club to tell a Mail on Sunday survey last month that they could not countenance any move to bring back standing. Rotheram, a Liverpool fan who swapped his Leppings Lane ticket for a seat shortly before kick-off, believes some people romanticise the days when 25,000 fans stood on The Kop - \\"grounds are less threatening now\\" - and points out that any notion of markedly cheaper tickets for standing sections is fanciful. \\"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction \\"The rising cost of tickets was something Taylor didn't predict,\\" he adds. \\"If prices had risen on a par with inflation they'd be £16 now, not £40. \\"How much cheaper would a standing ticket be? £5? Working-class fans aren't staying away because they're short of a fiver; they're not coming because they're short of £40.\\" Rotheram is right about a return to standing areas not being the panacea to rocketing prices that many yearn for - most British stadia have been designed, or redesigned, with a capacity in mind, and the concourses, exits and gangways cannot accommodate a significant hike in fans. But the cost of tickets is not the only thing Taylor did not see coming. He thought fans would get used to sitting down. \\"The people I call the 'carnival fans', those who create most of the atmosphere, have never got used to sitting,\\" says Pearson. \\"The authorities have simply lost the battle, and blind eyes are being turned around the country every weekend, particularly in away ends.\\" Pearson is also right. Many fans cannot understand why clubs below the Championship can legally provide standing areas, and even promoted clubs, such as Yeovil Town, are given two years to go all-seater. If safety is the primary concern, surely this should happen immediately. Then there is the apparent contradiction of allowing fans to stand at horse racing or rugby. This is an anomaly Bristol Sport, the owner of Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club, might be ready to test with its new plans for a renovated Ashton Gate with two standing sections. And finally you have perhaps the most glaring example of the chasm that is growing between the British authorities' view of how football should be consumed, and the way many fans would like to consume it: the Bundesliga. Profitable, successful and suddenly fashionable, the German league has become the Premier League's bête noire. What it lacks in TV contracts, it compensates with noisy fans, who are closely engaged with their clubs. It is why an estimated 1,000 Brits travel to Dortmund every fortnight to experience the Westfalenstadion's \\"Yellow Wall\\", the 25,000-capacity southern terrace. Unlike most of the rest of Europe, German clubs resisted the move to all-seaters, and in recent years many of them have upgraded their terraces with \\"rail seats\\". These are metal seats that can be flipped up, and locked in place, providing space to stand behind a waist-high rail that runs along the back of the row in front. Every \\"seat\\" is linked to a ticket number, and can be flipped down to meet Uefa rules for European games. Bringing rail seating here has become a crusade for Jon Darch. For the last two years, the Bristol City fan has taken his \\"Safe Standing Roadshow\\" to grounds around the country. Darch, who admits to being sponsored by a manufacturer of rail seats, says they are \\"patently safe\\" and \\"tick every box\\" for any club considering a return to standing. Celtic are just one club Darch has visited, but the Scottish champions have gone one step further than everybody else by formally applying for permission to trial 2,000 rail seats at Celtic Park, with no increase in overall capacity. \\"We feel there is a new vibrancy in football that has come from Europe and is now in the UK,\\" said Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell in September. \\"The safest way to manage that is through safe-standing. These are new systems that are extremely safe, and we are very keen to explore that at Celtic Park.\\" With Scottish clubs not being bound by the all-seater requirements of the 1989 Football Spectators Act, and the Scottish Professional Football League dropping its opposition to standing in 2011, hopes had been high that Glasgow City Council's safety advisory group would back Celtic's plan. But a spokesman for the council says talks are \\"at an extremely early stage\\", and points out \\"this would be a major policy shift\\". Just how major a shift it would be is clear from the response of perhaps the group's most persuasive voice, Police Scotland. \\"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction,\\" says  assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins. \\"If, however, the local authority and safety committee grant permission, we will work with the club and police it accordingly.\\" Police opposition is probably the biggest obstacle the safe-standing campaign faces. But even here the picture is blurred. Our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management The Football Supporters' Federation's safe-standing co-ordinator Peter Daykin says representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers have told his organisation they were willing to put aside their historic opposition to standing and start a dialogue with fans. According to Daykin, match-day commanders increasingly believe that standing sections could reduce tensions between those fans who want to stand and the stewards tasked with making them sit. \\"The objections now tend not to be about safety - we see from Germany, Norway, the US and Leagues One and Two that people stand safely week in, week out - but have moved to standing as the potential cause of crowd disorder,\\" he adds. \\"We don't believe there is any evidence to link the two, but we've always asked for an evidence-led debate and not a law based on speculation. That's why we want permission to hold a small number of trials in advance of any change in the existing rules.\\" But just to emphasise that nothing is simple in this debate, there is even disagreement about how any change to the status quo might happen. The law insists upon all-seater stadia, but it is not against the law for fans not to use those seats; that is a breach of contract between fan and club, based on the ground regulations. Compliance with these regulations is the remit of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA), which took on this role when the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) was wound up in 2011. \\"The legalities of safe-standing can be debated between solicitors but our understanding is that primary legislation is not required,\\" says Daykin. \\"The Secretary of State (for Culture, Media and Sport) can direct the SGSA to drop the all-seat requirement from the licence it issues. It's not an outrageous proposal - League One and League Two clubs are already exempt.\\" Some hope the abolition of the FLA, which was vehemently against standing, might be the key that unlocks the door to Bundesliga-style terraces. This might prove to be the case in the future - the rhetoric is certainly less dogmatic than it used to be - but for now the regulator's opposition to standing remains. \\"We recognise there are some fans who may prefer to stand, and we're happy to engage in an informed and constructive debate, but our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management,\\" says SGSA chief executive Ruth Shaw. \\"It can also help to create a more inclusive and diverse environment.\\" Shaw's reference to crowd management is interesting given the current focus on stopping fans from bringing pyrotechnics into games, as well as the damage caused by some Celtic fans at Motherwell's Fir Park last weekend. It will be some time before the SGSA, most police and many politicians are convinced that identifying wrongdoers in a standing area is as easy as it is in a seated section, regardless of the improvements in CCTV. So what we are left with is an impasse, with many in football stuck in a No Man's Land between the opposing camps, frightened to move, but scared at being left behind. It is telling that while 19 of 20 Premier League clubs have said they would like to talk about a return to standing, none has raised it at a Premier League shareholders meeting. Even Cardiff City, who have spent most of this year moving persistent standers to the Canton Stand and letting them get on with it, have not tried. The last meeting was a fortnight ago. In the meantime, stewards up and down the land will continue to look for common-sense solutions to the problem of being asked to enforce an unpopular law, and many fans will pay for a seat they do not want. Summary:","output":"Many football fans continue to express their desire for the option to stand during matches, despite a ban on standing areas in the top two divisions in England and Wales. Some clubs are exploring the idea of reintroducing standing areas to improve the atmosphere at games, as surveys show that nine out of ten fans would like the choice to stand. The push for safe-standing, as seen in the German Bundesliga with the incorporation of rail seating, has gained momentum, and efforts by clubs like Celtic to trial rail seating are being considered in the UK. However, there remain obstacles, such as police opposition and debates around safety and crowd management, that need to be addressed before a potential return to standing areas in football stadiums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

William Shatner sued for 170 million by man claiming to be his long-lost son William Shatner is being sued for 170 million by a radio host who claims to be the “Star Trek” legend’s long-lost son. Peter Sloan has boldly gone and filed legal paperwork in Florida demanding Shatner submit to a DNA test and cease claiming he isn’t his father. Sloan, 59, claims his birth mother, late Canadian actress Kathy McNeil, had a brief affair with Captain Kirk in Toronto. She gave him up for adoption at 5 days old. But Shatner, 85, denies Sloan is his son, and claims the local radio host is trying to unfairly live long and prosper from the connection. In the lawsuit, filed in Tampa, Fla., Sloan states he met with the actor on the set of “T.J. Hooker” in 1984 and Shatner initially “admitted he was the plaintiff’s father.” But a week later, Sloan claims, he was contacted by a rep for Shatner, who said he was “totally denying paternity at this point,” and added, “Don’t go public . . . [as it] could be horrendous for [Shatner],” who refused a DNA test. After Sloan surprised Shatner at a meet-and-greet, registered the Web domain petershatner.com and began a local CBS radio show in 2011 under the name Peter Shatner, he got a letter from Shatner’s lawyer, Erik Hyman, saying his actions were highly illogical. “Bill . . . confirmed to me once again that he is not your father. There have been many people over the years who have claimed to be his children or other relatives,” Hyman wrote, adding, “He is an incredibly busy, 80-year-old man, and is not interested in spending time discussing this issue with you.” Hyman didn’t comment last night. Sloan alleges in the papers that reps for Shatner had succeeded in getting Twitter to shut down his feed, and IMDb Pro to take down a page about a movie he was working on. Sloan — who wants to beam up to a jury trial — told us, “I am William Shatner’s son, and I just wish he would acknowledge me.” Shatner’s rep told us, “Mr. Shatner has three lovely daughters, but no sons . . . Mr. Shatner is aware of the lawsuit, but there’s nothing there because he isn’t his father.” This article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.

I can use this background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  Now, I have a new situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Answer this question please: Which species would have lesser reproductive success, species A or species B? Answer:","output":"Species B would have lesser reproductive success compared to species A. This is because species B has some harmful traits that may make it less suited to survive and reproduce in its environment. On the other hand, species A has helpful traits that provide it with an advantage in survival and reproduction, making it more likely to pass on its traits to future generations. This is in line with the theory of evolution by natural selection, wherein organisms with advantageous traits have greater reproductive success, leading to an increase in the presence of those traits over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Silicon Valley billionaires-in-waiting may face reckoning amid stock panic Silicon Valley startups basking in billion-dollar valuations may face a long-overdue reckoning as a result of the global panic set off by roiling Chinese markets, investors and analysts have warned. The number of technology companies with so-called “unicorn” designations of 1bn or more reached at least 131 on Monday, as healthcare websites, big-data firms and even Buzzfeed joined the kings of a new digital economy like Uber (51bn) and Fitbit (3.7bn). Related: Why is China's stock market falling and how might it affect the global economy? But Silicon Valley watchers examining the ripple effects of a selloff across sectors from Beijing to the Nasdaq, which continued in Asian trading on Tuesday although European markets bounced back, insist those valuations have been too generous for too long – and may have consequences for both the startup scene and the market at large. Whether the recalibration represents a market adjustment or a bursting tech bubble, investors say this week’s global stock rollercoaster is a sign of weakening confidence in the startup sector’s bigger bets – especially in what one venture capitalist called the increasingly difficult prospects “for some very high-end stuff to go public”. Related: Stock markets surge after China cuts interest rates - live updates Venture capitalists tend to lead the way in seed funding for glitzy startups, but they may be left without more risk-averse investors to bankroll the homestretch toward an IPO in a volatile environment. “I could see mutual funds pulling out of the market, leaving traditional VCs – and the VCs are going to be more aggressive on valuation,” said Maarten Hooft, managing partner at Quest Venture Partners, which focuses on early-stage investment. Such seed-stage investments and so-called “Series A” funding were likely to continue, VC backers and analysts agreed. But the ability of startups to rapidly snatch millions upon millions – particularly in the absence of profitability – could begin to fade away, with buyouts likely to rise. Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark, wrote on Twitter that he thought tech investors had become too fond of growth and had failed to pay enough attention to “names” that didn’t turn enough profit. The decline of technology stocks, which he said had been “getting crushed” since mid-July, could represent “an inflection point”. On Monday, the technology sector of the S&P 500 fared better than the index’s average, but prominent public tech stocks still suffered: “I think this is probably a correction rather than the start of the end of the bull market,” said Hooft. “People are trying to take into account the news coming out of China and Europe and emerging markets, and then trying to figure out how that plays back into the US tech sector. For me, what I was thinking about doing this morning when I saw Facebook was down was buying more Facebook.” Uncertainty in the startup world may mean good news for media giants large enough to weather a market correction – and perhaps even the smaller startups that could get swallowed up by them. “We’re at a point where both kind of core supports of the media ecosystem are shaking – advertising and the subscription business,” said analyst Rich Greenfield of the research firm BTIG. “Every one of these companies has ‘missed’ mobile.” Companies attracting upwards of 1bn in funding were “relatively small acquisitions” for giants like Disney, Greenfield noted. “You’ve got massive companies like Snapchat sitting out there,” he said, referring to the social network reported to be raising some 650m in its latest round – ahead of a valuation that could be worth 16bn. Hooft said for tech companies that have managed to acquire hundred-million-dollar stakes in the last year and a half, it is a buyer’s market and mergers-and-acquisition activity is very likely as soon as cash-rich techies “see an opportunity to do some talent acquisition or to buy cheaply into a space so they can give it a go”. And the larger tech firms themselves might get in on the action: “A lot of the tech companies have a lot of cash and they have to do something with it,” said Hooft. Regardless of who ends up acquired and who gets forced to IPO in an uncertain market, “valuations will probably be toned down a bit”, said the other venture capitalist, who asked not to be named. “The focus is on how hard it is going to be for some very high-end stuff to go public,” he said. “How does Pinterest go public now? Dropbox? Square?” Summary:","output":"In this news article, it talks about how some technology companies in Silicon Valley might be facing some challenges due to the global panic caused by the Chinese markets. These companies have been valued at very high amounts, but now it is believed that these valuations might have been too much and could affect the startup scene and the market in general. This could mean that it might be more difficult for these companies to get more money from investors and could lead to more buyouts or mergers happening. The bigger tech companies might also get involved in these mergers and buyouts, since they have a lot of money to spend. In simpler words, some technology companies in Silicon Valley may face some difficulties because of problems in the world market. This might make it harder for them to get money and could lead to bigger companies buying or joining with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. School is filled with distractions, from your friends to sports and parties, and once you get to college no one will call your parents if you skip class. But try to make academics your priority. You won’t be an honors student if you are chronically absent. You cannot excel if you aren't there to learn and discuss the material.  Many honors courses have additional requirements, such as class participation or class discussion. If you miss class, you miss out on this part of your grade. A good circle of friends or study partners can hold you accountable. Consider making a deal with your study-buddies to keep each other in class. Schools usually have resources available to help you reach your highest potential. You just have to ask. It should be possible to find a study group, for example, and some schools even have special centers for tutoring in subjects like math. Be aware of what's available.  Talk with your teacher if you're having difficulty, or you'd just like to understand a topic more clearly. As long as it's not an hour before the test, most teachers are happy to answer your questions. Join a peer tutoring program if you need more intensive one-on-one help. Peer tutors know their stuff -- you have to do well in a subject in order to become one. They can guide you through assignments and major concepts, build up your base of knowledge, or help you prepare for an upcoming exam. Don't despair if your school doesn't offer these resources. It's always possible to form your own study circle. But be careful if your study circle consists only of close friends. Minimize your distractions and remember to hit those books! You forget 47% of the information you encounter within twenty minutes. You forget 68% in a day.Take good notes for every subject in order to remember what you’ve covered in reading and lectures for later review.  Taking notes is an art form. It will take you some time to learn how to listen and read effectively and identify the most important things. Oftentimes school writing centers offer students tips for this.  How you take notes – whether by computer or hand – is up to you. Studies suggest that taking notes by hand is better for comprehension and recall, though. Some (but not all) teachers are also fine with students recording them in class. Just make sure to ask for their permission beforehand. Many honor students like using the Cornell method, which involves taking notes during class and then later returning to them to review and condense. This method is great for courses that cover clearly-defined subjects, such as math, science, and history. It is less useful for more abstract courses that focus less on memorization and recall, such as a discussion-heavy literature course. Whether essays, lab reports, or problem sets, assignments will usually make up a big part of your total grade in a course. Missing just one might mean a reduction in your final mark. It might mean more. It can be the difference between a final B+ and an A.  There are also reasons to do your homework besides just the grades. Studies have shown that completing your homework is linked to higher achievement and to the development of skills like time management, responsibility, and good study habits.  Turn in your assignments early when possible. If your paper is due online at midnight, it's practically a guarantee that there will be a dozen students trying to upload it at 11:59, which could cause system crashes. Do your assignments as soon as possible, and definitely turn them in early when you can.  A strong history of turning in your assignments on time also makes teachers more likely to be flexible if you have a genuine emergency. If you've only turned in a third of your homework to start with, though, your teacher is unlikely to be impressed by your excellent excuse for not doing it this time. While it's usually a good thing to study with classmates, there can be a thin line between cooperating and cheating. Your teachers will expect you to hand in your own work. If you aren't clear on what's acceptable, talk with your teacher beforehand.  Be especially careful when it comes to homework assignments. Unless it's a group project, it may be inappropriate to do an assignment with others. Never plagiarize. Using another person's answers, or copying words from a book or website into an essay, are forms of plagiarism and academically dishonest. Plagiarism can cause you to fail an assignment or course or even get you expelled. Being an honor student probably means hitting the books more than your peers. Review your lessons and notes at home or before class. Review with friends or alone. Review while on the bus or watching TV. You can also try as much as possible to read ahead, as this will help you to ask reasonable questions and allow you to understand new topics more easily.  Try bringing flashcards with you on the bus or public transit. You can review them while you're riding to school, or even while you're standing in line at the store. By reviewing your material in smaller chunks frequently, you're more likely to commit it to long-term memory. Many students seem to believe that they're great multitaskers. However, many studies show that multitasking, or trying to focus on several tasks at the same time, simply doesn't work. You just end up spreading your attention out thinly over several areas, rather than focusing it on one. So put the cell phone away, log off social media, and turn off the TV while you're studying. This works the other way around, too. Even the most dedicated honor student needs time to decompress and relax, or you'll burn out. Schedule in some dedicated \\"me time\\" and keep it faithfully. If you're on a half-hour break, try not to think about homework.

Context: The SAH gene locus has recently been proposed to be involved in obesity-related hypertension in Japanese individuals.', 'To replicate independently the initial findings in another ethnic group, we scanned the entire SAH gene in 190 Caucasian chromosomes. A total of 651 patients with essential hypertension and 776 controls (PEGASE Study) were genotyped for all identified variants using allele-specific oligonucleotides, and single nucleotide polymorphism as well as haplotype analyses were carried out. We also performed transient transfection experiments, northern and western blots, immunoprecipitation, and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity assays.', 'We identified five polymorphisms in the promoter region (C-1808T, G-1606A, -962ins/del, G-451A, T-67C), two in introns 5 and 7 (T+9/In5C, A+20/In7T), and one missense variant (K359N).

Conversely, for -962del, the OR for hypertension was 0.80 (P = 0.042). The SAH alleles -1606A and 359N, but not -962ins/del, displayed a raising effect on body mass index (BMI; P = 0.004 and P = 0.030, respectively) in hypertensive as well as in control individuals. After adjustment for BMI in hypertensive individuals, only the OR associated with -962ins/del remained significant (OR 0.77, P = 0.028). Functional analyses in BHK did not reveal differences for SAH 359N or 359K-containing constructs, formally excluding K359N as the functional variant.

To have a happy, fulfilling retirement, you need to start preparing right away. The most obvious thing for people to do when they retire is to take up a hobby. The most important step to take before retiring, though, is to make sure that you actually have started some hobbies. Once you're retired, unless you 've already started a hobby, you'll find it very hard to get into something new. Some hobbies aren't for everyone. Think about what you enjoy doing and start participating on a casual basis now. Another thing many people participate in is volunteering. Not only does volunteering give you something to do, it also gives you a sense of accomplishment  and can add meaning to your life .Volunteering is also rewarding in other ways, too. There are hundreds of different types of volunteer services and you'll always be able to meet new and interesting people. Also, don't think that volunteering is always only about helping someone for free. Many companies pay their volunteers after they've had enough experience and prove themselves to be valuable workers. There are plenty of other potions, as well. Going back to school is a great way to keep yourself feeling young. Taking a vacation around the world with your loved ones is another great way to spend your retirement. Ultimately, though, the key to a happy retirement is simply keeping yourself busy and doing whatever you love.

He was raised Catholic. One of Kaine's great-grandparents was Scottish and the other seven were Irish. In 2005, Kaine ran for governor of Virginia against Republican candidate Jerry W. Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Kaine was considered an underdog for most of the race, trailing in polls for most of the election. Two polls released in September 2005 showed Kaine trailing Kilgore--by four percentage points in a Washington Post poll and by one percentage point in a Mason-Dixon/Roanoke Times poll. The final opinion polls of the race before the November election showed Kaine slightly edging ahead of Kilgore.  Kaine ultimately prevailed, winning 1,025,942 votes (51.7%) to Kilgore's 912,327 (46.0%). (A third candidate--independent state Senator H. Russell Potts Jr., who ran as an \\"independent Republican\\"--received 43,953 votes (2.2%)).  Kaine emphasized fiscal responsibility and a centrist message. He expressed support for controlling sprawl and tackling longstanding traffic issues, an issue that resonated in the exurbs of northern Virginia. He benefited from his association with the popular outgoing Democratic governor, Mark Warner, who had performed well in traditionally Republican areas of the state. On the campaign trail, Kaine referred to the \\"Warner-Kaine administration\\" in speeches and received the strong backing of Warner. Kilgore later attributed his defeat to Warner's high popularity and the \\"plummeting popularity\\" of Republican President George W. Bush, who held one rally with Kilgore on the campaign's final day.  The campaign turned sharply negative in its final weeks, with Kilgore running television attack ads that claimed, incorrectly, that Kaine believed that \\"Hitler doesn't qualify for the death penalty.\\" The ads also attacked Kaine for his service ten years earlier as a court-appointed attorney for a death-row inmate.

Williams' eighth league goal of the season was the difference between the two sides after he headed Tommy Rowe's cross beyond Notts goalkeeper Scott Loach in the second half. Matty Blair could have doubled Doncaster's lead minutes later when he headed another cross from the left onto the foot of a post. Rovers had two opportunities late in the game to further their advantage as Williams broke away on the counter-attack five minutes from time, only to pull his effort wide. Liam Mandeville then found himself in behind the Notts defence deep in stoppage time, but he squeezed the ball wide from a tight angle. The defeat was the Magpies' seventh in a row in League Two, with their last victory coming back in mid-October at Portsmouth.

This convenient purchasing option brings the lottery to drivers, making it easier and more accessible than ever before. Following the purchase, the chosen lottery numbers will be texted to the player's cell phone for easy tracking and reference. With a 50-a-week spending limit in place, officials aim to discourage overspending while giving players a chance to try their luck conveniently. The integration of the lottery at the gas pump Minnesota Lottery has successfully acknowledged the need for a more modern and integrated approach to providing lottery ticket purchases. By allowing drivers to buy lottery tickets directly at the gas pump, they have created a seamless and accessible experience for players. This not only makes the process more convenient but also encourages drivers to try their luck, possibly increasing the overall interest in the lottery. Receiving lottery numbers via text message After purchasing a lottery ticket at the pump, players will now receive their lottery numbers directly to their cell phones via a text message. This ensures that players have instant access to their numbers, alleviating the need to retain paper copies of their tickets. This feature adds to the convenience and eco-friendly nature of the new buying process, aligning with the increasing importance of environmental sustainability. The 50-a-week spending limit To protect potential lottery players from overspending, Minnesota Lottery officials have implemented a 50-a-week spending limit at the gas pumps. This responsible approach ensures that players can enjoy participating in the lottery without inadvertently falling victim to impulse spending. The cap encourages an environment of responsible gambling and reduces the risks associated with excessive spending on lottery tickets. Conclusion The Minnesota Lottery's innovative approach to ticket sales at gas pumps is a testament to their commitment to modernizing and improving the lottery experience for their players. By making the purchasing process more convenient and incorporating environmentally friendly features such as digital ticket delivery via text messages, the lottery officials display a forward-thinking attitude. The addition of the 50-a-week spending limit further emphasizes their responsibility in fostering a healthy gambling environment.

Mickey Mouse made his debut in the short film, \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" on November 18, 1928. Walt Disney not only collaborated with Ub Iwerks to design the character but also personally lent his voice to Mickey. For the majority of the first 20 years, Walt Disney took on the role as Mickey Mouse's voice actor in short films, feature films, and other animated productions. This includes the notable short films such as \\"Plane Crazy\\" (1929), \\"The Band Concert\\" (1935), and \\"Brave Little Tailor\\" (1938). Walt's distinctive falsetto voice enhanced Mickey's character, making him an audience favorite and establishing Mickey Mouse as the key mascot of the Disney brand. However, in 1946, James G. MacDonald, a sound effects artist and Disney collaborator, took over from Walt Disney as the principal voice actor for Mickey Mouse. This transition happened because Walt Disney's ever-growing responsibilities as a studio head, philanthropist, and visionary led to him having less time and difficulty maintaining Mickey's high-pitched voice. Although Walt Disney stepped away from providing Mickey's voice, he continued to contribute to the character's development and personality until his passing in 1966. The success and popularity of Mickey Mouse, maintained through voice talents like Walt Disney and James G. MacDonald, have made the character an enduring and beloved icon for nearly a century."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.  Question: \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" Answer: \\"Companies such as Hilton Hotels getting into the gaming business in Las Vegas\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. The new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments and established companies such as Hilton Hotels buying into the gaming business, along with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: An Oregon man accused of killing his girlfriend by pushing her off a 100-foot cliff eight years ago has pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion in her death, PEOPLE confirms.      Stephen Wagner Nichols, 42, was sentenced earlier this week to 19 months for each of the felonies as well as three years’ of probation. But he received credit for his time already in custody, meaning he will not spend any more time behind bars.      Nichols was accused of killing 23-year-old girlfriend Rhonda Casto during a hike along Oregon’s scenic Eagle Creek Trail in March 2009. Authorities alleged he pushed her off a cliff to her death in order to collect on a 1 million life insurance policy.      But Nichols’ defense attorney, Mike Arnold, says his client was “falsely accused,” and he welcomed the recent plea.      “It was a long time coming,” Arnold tells PEOPLE. “It is an amazing outcome. It is not every day that somebody charged with murder ends up with criminally negligent homicide and a probation sentence.”      The Hood River County, Oregon, District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.      “I am kind of numb,” says Casto’s mother, Julia Anne Simmons. “I feel awful. I think he [Nichols] should be in prison.”      Stephen Wagner Nichols Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facilities/AP      Casto, her mom says, was “very precocious, loud and funny. She was 23 and in the prime of her life. She had everything going for her.”      Simmons believes that Nichols killed her daughter, whom he met in fall 2005, because she was gearing up to leave him and take their infant daughter, Ava, with her.      “She was going to move out,” Simmons says, “but she was trying to get up the courage to do it. She was disillusioned about Steve.”      Nichols has adamantly denied he had anything to do with Casto’s death. He told police that she accidentally slipped and he hiked down to her battered body to help her — but without a cell phone, he hiked back up to the trail, headed to the parking lot and called for help.      • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

But six years later, in April 2014, a grand jury handed down a secret indictment against Nichols and an arrest warrant was issued for him days later.      He was arrested in February 2015 at the San Francisco International Airport, after he returned from China with his daughter.      The case made national headlines and was featured on CBS’ 48 Hours. Nicholas was scheduled to go to trial in the summer of 2018.      “This is so unfair — this is the justice system being stupid,” Simmons says of the sentencing. “I am just disgusted with the outcome.” ||||| For nearly a decade, mystery has surrounded what happened to 23-year-old aspiring model Rhonda Casto, whose lifeless body was found at the bottom of a steep ravine.      On March 16, 2009, the young mother had set out with her boyfriend, Steve Nichols, to hike the popular Eagle Creek Trail along Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge. But what was supposed to be a leisurely day hike turned into a nightmare when fire officials, responding to a 911 call from Nichols, came across the ghoulish scene of Casto’s death.      What appeared to be an accident turned into a murder investigation, bolstered by Casto’s family’s belief that Nichols — the father of Casto’s daughter, Ava — had something to do with her dying.      Adding to their suspicions was a statement Casto allegedly made before she went on the hike.      “She told my mother and my sister that ‘he is either going to give me a ring or throw me off a cliff, ha ha ha,’ ” Casto’s mother, Julia Simmons, tells reporter Maria Elena Salinas in Monday’s episode of The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas on Investigation Discovery and exclusively previewed above. “She made a joke of it. ”      But Simmons didn’t think Casto was kidding. And after she died, family members went to the police.      “We all told him [the detective] we believe that Steve pushed her,” Simmons tells Salinas. “This is not an accident.”      Simmons says authorities were very interested in what the family had to say. At the time, however, she says she didn’t confront Nichols with her allegations: “Police wouldn’t let me see him, because they knew I was enraged.”      Rhonda Cast Source: Rhonda Casto - Justice/Facebook      In February 2015, nearly six years after Casto died, Nichols was arrested and charged with killing her — accused of pushing her off the 100-foot cliff so he could collect a 1-million life insurance policy.      Authorities also pointed to an alleged inappropriate relationship with Casto’s underage sister and a previous incident where Nichols was accused of attempting to push his then-wife off a balcony in China in 2003.      He denied all of these claims and the case encountered multiple legal obstacles as it proceeded.      In February 2017, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled a three-hour police interview with Nichols after his arrest was inadmissible. Adding to the prosecution’s problems was the fact that the former lead detective, who had retired in 2012, destroyed evidence on his computer, including crime scene and autopsy photos and trail-head fee envelopes from potential witnesses.      • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.      In May 2017, in a move that angered Casto’s family, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Nichols. In return, he pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion.      According to his plea, Nichols received three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time.      Nichols still maintains he had nothing to do with Casto’s death. When confronted by Salinas about her alleged prophetic words to her family, he responded: “The simple answer is I don’t think she ever actually said that.”      “She was so happy,” Nichols told PEOPLE in a previous interview about the day the couple went for a hike.      Steve Nichols Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facilities/AP      Though Nichols said he doesn’t remember much about what happened, he did recall Casto running along the narrow trail with a towel over her shoulders, like “Superwoman,” and he said he witnessed her fall.      He tried to help her, he said — sliding down the ravine and trying to swim across a freezing creek to get to her. However, by the time he reached her body, he said, he collapsed on top of her from exhaustion and hypothermia.      Nichols said he believes prescription drugs played a part in Casto’s death, which he called an accident, and he claimed he later discovered she was using marijuana and also taking medication to lose weight and for depression.      But Simmons doesn’t buy Nichols’ story and described her daughter’s relationship with him as volatile, though he said they “hardly ever fought.”      Simmons says Casto was considering ending things with him before she died.      “She was going to move out, but she was trying to get up the courage to do it,” Simmons previously told PEOPLE. “She was worried about not having enough money to support Ava.”      The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas airs Monday (10 p.m. ET) on Investigation Discovery. ||||| The last words an Oregon woman spoke to her family included a joke about being murdered, before she died while hiking with her boyfriend in 2009.      Julia Simmons, the mother of Rhonda Casto, shared what her daughter said with Maria Elena SLaines of Investigative Discovery's The Real Story, in an interview that airs on Monday.      Casto's last words to her grandmother and aunt before embarking on the Eagle Creek Trail along Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge on March 16, 2009, with Stephen Nichols were supposedly, 'He is either going to give me a ring or throw me off a cliff, ha ha ha,' Simmons said.      Nichols, who was first charged with murder in 2015 for Casto's death, instead pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion in May 2017, and was sentenced to three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time.      Casto and Nichols shared a daugther, named Ava.      The last words Rhonda Casto (right) spoke to her family included a joke about being murdered, before she died while hiking with her boyfriend, Stephen Nichols (left) in Oregon in 2009      The plea deal for Nichols came after the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in March 2017 that a detective should have stopped interrogating Nichols when the suspect said he did not want to discuss Casto’s death.      The interview occurred shortly after Nichols’ February 2015 arrest at San Francisco International Airport, nearly six years after his partner’s death.      A Hood River County judge had ruled the statement inadmissible, but the state appealed to the higher court, and lost.      Nichols, who has maintained he had nothing to do with Casto's death, told People magazine, 'She was so happy' on the day of the hike.      When asked about what she allegedly said to her family that day, he said, 'The simple answer is I don’t think she ever actually said that.'      But Simmons paints a different picture, having previously told People, 'She was going to move out, but she was trying to get up the courage to do it.'      Simmons added: 'She was worried about not having enough money to support Ava.'      Nichols, then a recently divorced 30-year-old day trader, met Casto, a 20-year-old aspiring model, in 2005 after Casto's mother introduced them      Nichols was originally charged with murder in 2015, but that charge was dropped when he took a plea deal that landed him three years’ of probation, with credit for 19 months of jail time      On the day Casto dies, Nichols called 911 at around 6pm that night to report Casto's 100-foot-fall to her death.      He has said that he slid down the ravine toward her, and had to cross an icy creek to reach her body, but by the time he got there he collapsed on top of her, overcome with exhaustion and hypothermia.      The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine.      The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the path treacherous.      Records show that several months before the incident, Nichols, then working as a day trader, increased Casto’s life insurance policy to 1 million.      Court documents show Nichols and Casto became romantically involved in 2005, according to The Oregonian.      Casto and Nichols reportedly both took out 1 million life insurance policies on each other shortly before her untimely death in March 2009      Treacherous path: The hiking trail where Casto fell to her death has a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine      In an interview with CBS' 48 Hours, Casto's mother, Julia Simmons, said that she was the one who introduced Nichols to her daughter while renting a room in his three-bedroom condominium in Portland.      Nichols was 30 years old and recently divorced, and Casto was 20 at the time.      'Everything about her was impressive,' Nichols said in the March 2015 interview, adding, 'and I just immediately fell in love with her.'      Before long, Casto moved into Nichols' home, and three years later they welcomed their baby daughter, who is now seven.      The papers reveal that the couple each bought a 1 million life insurance policy in late 2008 from MetLife and named each other as beneficiaries. Their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary.      Nichols eventually agreed to split the money with Casto's mother and with the estate of his daughter.      In the 48 Hours interview, Nichols said that after delivering their baby, Casto said she wanted to lose the baby weight so she could start modelling again, so the couple took up hiking.      Simmons said that in the weeks leading up to the fatal March 2009 outing to the Eagle Creek Trial, her daughter told her that Nichols had been trying to convince her to go for a hike for a month.      Nichols said that day started off as a nice day but the weather turned inclement as the couple were making their up the narrow, moss-covered trail      As they reached a particularly slippery portion of the pathway, Casto fell off the cliff to her death.      Nichols said he hiked down to the spot where his girlfriend came to rest and tried to give her CPR, but it was too late.      He would later claim that the 23-year-old mom was high that afternoon, was acting silly and running on the slick trail before disaster struck.      The Real Story with Maria Elena Salinas airs on Monday at 10.00pm Eastern on Investigation Discovery. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In Oregon, Stephen Wagner Nichols, 42, has pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and coercion in the death of his 23-year-old girlfriend Rhonda Casto, who was pushed off a 100-foot cliff during a hike in March 2009. Nichols was accused of committing the murder in order to receive a 1 million life insurance payout. Nichols was sentenced to 19 months in prison for each charge and 3 years' probation, but given the time he has already spent in custody, he will not face further imprisonment. The case saw numerous legal obstacles and difficulties for the prosecution, including a defense victory in the Oregon Supreme Court ruling out a three-hour police interview with Nichols as inadmissible. However, Casto's mother, Julia Anne Simmons, continues to maintain that Nichols killed her daughter; Casto had been considering breaking up with Nichols and taking their infant daughter with her at the time of her death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Badly trailing Hillary Clinton in delegates and the popular vote despite his eight-of-nine winning streak, Bernie Sanders needed a dramatic moment in New York on Tuesday night to shake up the Democratic nomination contest before it’s simply too late.      Instead, it was Clinton who delivered the statement with a decisive win in her home state. With 90 precincts reporting, she led 58 to 42 percent, and was declared the winner by The Associated Press.      Story Continued Below      \\"Today you proved again, there's no place like home,\\" she told a raucous crowd in New York City afterward. \\"This one's personal,\\" she added of her victory.      The emphatic win by Clinton could finally put to rest lingering doubts about her struggles to stamp out the Vermont independent — and allow her to finally pivot in earnest to the general election as the slugfest continues on the Republican side.      A huge haul of 247 delegates, plus 44 superdelegates, is up for grabs — though the state’s complex, proportional allocation scheme makes a big swing in the totals for either candidate unlikely.      After a big loss in his native state for the Brooklyn-born Sanders, it won't get any easier. Five states that vote on April 26 — Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island — are seen as largely playing to Clinton's strengths. Ted Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders, told the AP late Tuesday night that the campaign would \\"assess where we are\\" after those contests.      Polling pointed to a sizable win for Clinton in New York — the main question Democratic insiders were debating heading into the election was whether she would prevail by single or double digits. Sanders played the expectations game from all angles, breathlessly telling supporters in an email over the weekend that a win would be “the most shocking upset in modern political history” and arguing that polls have repeatedly underestimated his strength, before seeming to acknowledge a likely defeat.      \\"What does it mean if I lose?\\" Sanders told CBS’ Charlie Rose on Monday. \\"It means that I lose.\\"      Speaking to supporters on Penn State University's campus hours before polls closed across the border, Sanders predicted, \\"We're going to do just fine tonight in New York.\\" Afterward, he flew back to his home state of Vermont. He told reporters when he landed that he planned \\"to get recharged and take a day off.\\"      Clinton, a seasoned veteran in New York campaigning after eight years as its senator and multiple statewide wins, campaigned with gusto, knowing a loss on her own turf would be a huge embarrassment. As she focused her efforts largely on New York City, making the rounds on niche media to compensate for Sanders’ 2 million spending advantage on the airwaves, Bill Clinton barnstormed upstate New York with as many as four events a day.      Clinton told a hip-hop radio show on Monday that she carries hot sauce with her everywhere she goes, and she sipped on bubble tea at Kung Fu Tea in Queens.      \\"I am hoping to do really well tomorrow,” Clinton told supporters at one campaign stop Monday. “I am hoping to wrap up the Democratic nomination. But! But. But I’m not taking anything for granted. I gotta quickly add that before anybody has the wrong impression.”      Delegates Remaining: 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 0 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination      The tailored approach appeared to be paying off: The RealClearPolitics polling average for the New York Democratic primary had Clinton ahead of Sanders by 12 points heading into Election Day.      Sanders was just as aware of the stakes. New York has long leaped out on the primary calendar as a crucial opportunity for Sanders to have any semblance of a case that his late winning streak makes him the stronger general election candidate. Overtaking Clinton is all but impossible — he trails by 244 pledged delegates, or nearly 700 counting superdelegates — but an upset in the state would have given the Vermont lawmaker a potent talking point that the momentum and enthusiasm heading into the home stretch of nomination season was decidedly on his side.      Fresh off a big streak in recent contests, most notably Wisconsin two weeks ago, Sanders went after Clinton aggressively in New York. He mocked Clinton’s refusal to release transcripts of her 200,000-plus-a-pop speeches to Wall Street banks and accused her of playing both sides of the fracking debate. A rally he staged in Washington Square Park drew 27,000 people, another glaring reminder of the disconnect between delegate counts and raw enthusiasm for the two candidates.      But missteps hurt his efforts. His suggestion last week that Clinton was unqualified to be commander in chief dogged Sanders for days, and he was eventually forced to clean up, saying it was really Clinton’s judgment he was questioning.      Also working against him was New York’s closed primary system; only registered Democrats can cast ballots in the primary, walling off independents who make up a big chunk of Sanders’ support. Roughly 3 million voters in the state are not registered as Democrats or Republicans, including nearly a half-million registered independents.      “Today, 3 million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary,” Sanders complained on Election Day. “That’s wrong.”      His campaign also seized on reports of voters having problems casting ballots on Tuesday.      \\"We are deeply disturbed by what we’re hearing from polling places across the state,\\" the Sanders campaign said in a statement. \\"From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what’s happening today is a disgrace.\\"      But the size of Clinton's win swamped those complaints and left Sanders without room to even claim a moral victory.      \\"Victory,\\" she told her supporters, \\"is in sight.\\"       ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prepares to speak during a New York primary night campaign event Tuesday, April 19, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) (Associated Press)      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prepares to speak during a New York primary night campaign event Tuesday, April 19, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Clinton emerged from New York's presidential primary closer to clinching the Democratic nomination and becoming the first woman to reach that milestone. Republican Donald Trump strengthened his own path to the general election with a commanding victory, but has little room for error in the states ahead.      The front-runners now hope to replicate their strong showings in New York in the cluster of Northeastern states next up on the primary calendar. Clinton was scheduled to spend Wednesday campaigning in Pennsylvania, while Trump had a rally planned in Maryland, as well as Indiana.      Following her win in New York, a jubilant Clinton made clear she was moving past her unexpectedly competitive primary battle with Bernie Sanders and setting her sights on the general election.      \\"The race for the nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight,\\" Clinton declared to cheering supporters. She mentioned Sanders only briefly as she appealed for support from his loyal backers, and saved her toughest talk for Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, deeming both \\"dangerous\\" for America.      Trump, too, is eager to move past the Republican primaries. With at least 89 of New York's 95 delegates in hand, he insisted it was \\"impossible\\" for any of his rivals to catch him and warned party leaders against trying to take the nomination away from him at the convention.      Ohio Gov. John Kasich won at least three New York delegates; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was in danger of getting shut out. Neither has a mathematical chance of clinching the nomination before the Republican convention in July, though they hope to block Trump's path and overtake him at the GOP gathering.      Cruz panned Trump's win in New York as little more than \\"a politician winning his home state,\\" then implored Republicans to unite around his candidacy.      \\"We must unite the Republican Party because doing so is the first step in uniting all Americans,\\" Cruz said. A freshman senator who has clashed repeatedly with his own party, Cruz has generated only lukewarm support from GOP leaders who see him as the only option for stopping Trump.      Clinton's triumph padded her delegate lead, putting her 80 percent of the way toward clinching the Democratic nomination that eluded her eight years ago. Appealing to Sanders' loyal supporters, Clinton said, \\"There is more that unites us than divides us.\\"      Exit polls suggested Democrats were ready to rally around whomever the party nominates. Nearly 7 in 10 Sanders supporters in New York said that they would definitely or probably vote for Clinton if she is the party's pick.      Sanders energized young people and liberals in New York, as he has across the country, but it wasn't enough to pull off the upset victory he desperately needed to change the trajectory of the Democratic race. Still, the Vermont senator vowed to keep competing.      \\"We've got a shot to victory,\\" Sanders said in an interview with The Associated Press. However, his senior adviser, Tad Devine, said later that the campaign planned to \\"sit back and assess where we are\\" after a string of contests next week.      Of the 247 Democratic delegates at stake in New York, Clinton picked up at least 135 while Sanders gained at least 104.      Trump needed a strong showing in New York to keep alive his chances of sewing up the GOP nomination before the party's July convention — and to quiet critics who say the long primary season has exposed big deficiencies in his campaign effort.      Having spent months relying on a slim staff, Trump has started hiring more seasoned campaign veterans.      Cruz is trying to stay close enough in the delegate count to push the GOP race to a contested convention. His campaign feels confident that it's mastered the complicated process of lining up individual delegates who could shift their support to the Texas senator after a first round of convention balloting.      Kasich, the only other Republican left in the race, bested Cruz on Tuesday and is refusing to end his campaign despite winning only his home state.      Trump's political strength, though he boasts of drawing new members to the party, has left some Republicans concerned that his nomination could splinter the GOP. Among Republican voters in New York, nearly 6 in 10 said the nominating contest is dividing the party, according to exit polls.      Still, about 7 in 10 New York Republicans said the candidate with the most votes in primary contests should be the Republican presidential nominee      The surveys were conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks.      Trump now leads the GOP race with 845 delegates, ahead of Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 147. Securing the GOP nomination requires 1,237.      Among Democrats, Clinton now has 1,893 delegates to Sanders' 1,180. Those totals include both pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses and superdelegates, the party insiders who can back the candidate of their choice regardless of how their state votes. It takes 2,383 to win the Democratic nomination.      ___      AP writers Thomas Beaumont, Lisa Lerer, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin, Emily Swanson and Steve Peoples contributed to this report.      ___      Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jonathan Lemire at http://twitter.com/JonLemire ||||| After More Than 100,000 Voters Dropped In Brooklyn, City Officials Call For Action      Enlarge this image toggle caption Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Stephanie Keith/Getty Images      Following widespread irregularities at polls in Brooklyn Tuesday, New York City officials are calling for major reforms at the Board of Elections.      The problem was first identified in a an analysis of state voter enrollment statistics by WNYC's Brigid Bergin. The Board of Elections then confirmed that more than 120,000 voters have been dropped from the rolls in Brooklyn alone since November.      \\"No other borough in New York City nor county in the rest of the state saw such a significant decline in active registered Democrats. In fact, only 7 of the state's 62 counties saw a drop in the number of Democrats. Everywhere else saw the numbers increase,\\" WNYC found. The more than 120,000 dropped includes 12,000 people who moved out of the borough, 44,000 people who were moved from active to inactive voter status, and 70,000 voters removed from the inactive voter list, according to the station.      The New York City Comptroller's office announced Tuesday that it would undertake an audit of the \\"operations and management of the Board of Elections.\\" In a letter to the board's director, Comptroller Scott Stringer outlined several issues with voting, including the removal of voters. \\"These errors have conspired to bar first time and longtime voters from exercising their fundamental democratic right,\\" he wrote.      In a statement late Tuesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Board of Elections should return every voter to the rolls who was recently purged, WNYC reports.      De Blasio said City Hall has received word of entire city blocks and buildings full of voters that were purged from the voting lists. He said the Brooklyn office of the Board of Elections should be removed from the process.      He says the perception of irregularities \\"undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed.\\" ||||| New York City (CNN) Bernie Sanders' campaign on Tuesday called reports of voting irregularities in New York state \\"a disgrace\\" as local officials rushed to condemn the city Board of Elections for stripping more than 125,000 Democratic voters from the rolls.      \\"It is absurd that in Brooklyn, New York -- where I was born, actually -- tens of thousands of people as I understand it, have been purged from the voting rolls,\\" Sanders said during an evening campaign rally at Penn State University.      In an email to CNN, Sanders spokesman Karthik Ganapathy called the state's handling of the primary a \\"shameful demonstration.\\"      \\"From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what's happening today is a disgrace,\\" he said.      Election Justice USA, a voter rights organization, told CNN it will go to Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday morning as part of an effort to have provisional ballots from voters disenfranchised by the Board of Elections counted before the primary results are certified.      Earlier in the day, a federal judge denied a temporary restraining order filed by the group that would have opened the polls to New York Democrats claiming they were unlawfully listed as Republican or unaffiliated.      A little before the polls here closed at 9 p.m., the polling site coordinator at Brooklyn Borough Hall estimated that about 10% of those who showed up to vote on Tuesday were previously removed by the board of elections. More than 2,800 people had voted at the location.      New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Hillary Clinton supporter, called for major reforms to the Board of Elections as a series of snafus continued to bubble up, including reports of the errant \\"purge\\" in Brooklyn.      \\"It has been reported to us from voters and voting rights monitors that the voting lists in Brooklyn contain numerous errors, including the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists,\\" de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday calling on the board to \\"reverse that purge.\\"      \\"The perception that numerous voters may have been disenfranchised undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed,\\" he said.      Speaking to CNN on Tuesday night, Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan pushed back against the growing criticism, saying, \\"We're not finding that there were issues throughout the city that are any different than what we experience in other elections.\\"      Of the 126,000 Democratic voters taken off from the rolls in Brooklyn, Ryan said 12,000 had moved out of borough, while 44,000 more had been placed in an inactive file after mailings to their homes bounced back. An additional 70,000 were already inactive and, having failed to vote in two successive federal elections or respond to cancel notices, were removed.      \\"Since the eyes and ears of the world are on New York, issues that are relatively routine for any election are receiving greater scrutiny,\\" he added.      In pledging to audit the board, the office of New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer issued a much stricter verdict.      \\"The people of New York City have lost confidence that the Board of Elections can effectively administer elections and we intend to find out why the BOE is so consistently disorganized, chaotic and inefficient,\\" he said.      The Clinton campaign had no immediate comment when asked by CNN.      New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's voter complaint hotline received more than 1,000 complaints throughout the day, Schneiderman's office said in a statement. The same office, he added, had heard only around 150 on the day of the 2012 general election.      As of 3:50, @AGSchneiderman voter hotline received > 700 complaints from voters across NYS. Context: Office received ~150 for '12 general. — Nick Benson (@nick_benson) April 19, 2016      In a statement out Wednesday, Schneiderman said, \\"I am deeply troubled by the volume and consistency of voting irregularities, both in public reports and direct complaints to my office's voter hotline.\\"      Schneiderman said his office was starting \\"inquiries in additional areas of the State where voting irregularities appeared unusually high.\\"      \\"Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and if any New Yorker was illegally prevented from voting, I will do everything in my power to make their vote count and ensure that it never happens again,\\" he said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both won their respective primaries in New York, bringing them one step closer to securing their parties’ nominations. Clinton’s win over Sanders has put to rest any doubts about her struggles to become the Democratic frontrunner, receiving around 58% of the votes compared to his 42%. Meanwhile, Trump managed to win at least 89 of the state’s 95 delegates, calling his victory “incredible”.

Article: One of the best-known women in the world is a small doll . This famous doll, called Barbie, was created by Ruth Handler in 1959. Now Barbie is known everywhere. Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby. From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career  girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity  for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval  as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize  Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable . However, if Barbie were a real person, she would be six feet tall and wear a size three shoe! Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true?

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.

His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts.  Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that Greg started reading about natural selection, which essentially describes the natural development of species.

These are just a few of the questions Anne Marie Stewart and her staff sometimes ask the \\"talent\\" who serve as non-speaking \\"extras\\" in special films, television series, and made-for-TV movies produced in Toronto. Of course, the majority of extra calls are for more ordinary people, and Stewart has a list of about 650 registered extras. Crowd scenes, which are common, call for everyday people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and sizes. Over at Movie People, last-minute requests are not unusual. \\"We got a request once for an entire brass band of 30 people. They wanted it within the hour,\\" said manager Yvonne McCartney. Another time, the company got a last-minute request for a newborn baby. \\"We found a baby that was three weeks premature,\\" said Jonathan Aiken, an owner of the company. Then there was the worried call from a casting director whose \\"Star\\" got doggone stubborn one day and decided to just lie down and not work. The director needed a replacement dog, fast. \\"We got them two in one hour.\\" said Aiken. \\"It was a matter of good connections and fast phone work.\\" The eight phone lines needed to make 350 to 400 calls a day are one of Movie People's major expenses. Phone lines are the only way to stay in touch with casting directors and extras; but the latter are a group not necessarily interested in a long-term relationship. Most extra jobs pay only 7 an hour (with a six-hour minimum), while most agencies charge an annual 75 registration fee and get 10 to 15 per cent of extras' earnings.

He left a voice mail dropping the senator's name and discussed the availability of the new Sony system.

She sent me an e-mail headed \\"This is what can happen\\" and wrote: \\"This is what can happen when we ask for special treatment. We cannot ever ask for special treatment. Ever.\\"      Below her note, she pasted a bunch of articles from newspapers and Web sites, all of which made fun of Edwards. A typical one said, \\"There are two Americas, one for rich people who can bypass the line, one for poor folks who can't.\\"      For the next few weeks, Elizabeth searched for these items on the Internet and sent them to me by the dozens. They arrived on my BlackBerry on weekdays and weekends, in the middle of the night, and over the holidays as I drove with my wife and kids to visit with family in Illinois. Although I apologized, explained what had happened, and took responsibility, nothing seemed to satisfy her. She was certain that I had told my assistant to throw around the senator's name, which I had not.      As the negative comments continued in the blogosphere, she sent me an angry note, the key sentence of which was written in capital letters: \\"I HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH YOUR APOLOGIES WHEN COMBINED WITH YOUR OWN BENIGN DESCRIPTION OF YOUR ROLE.\\" When another apology from me didn't work, Mrs. Edwards switched from expressing her anger to trying to make me feel ashamed. On December 4, she wrote: \\"I noticed that although you have steered clear of me, you are bringing John home tomorrow. Think of that as an opportunity to be completely honest . . . not to complain that I am being too harsh on you. In my view, you are not harsh enough on yourself.\\"      At some point, even a good soldier gets angry at the brass, and after weeks of her harangues I got angry. I printed out many of the e-mails I had received from her and brought them with me to the airport on a day when I was meeting the senator. Once he got in the car, I showed them to him and then told him I'd resign if necessary. When I finished, the senator recalled previous talks we had had about Mrs. Edwards, their marriage, and their difficulties. He said, \\"Andrew, this is [expletive] harassment. Don't worry about this. And you're not quitting.\\" The e-mails about the PlayStation 3 stopped that evening.      On the day after Christmas, Mrs. Edwards wrote to tell me to make sure the Christmas tree supplier would come to collect the big Douglas fir at eight-fifteen on the morning of December 29. \\"Also,\\" she added, \\"the kids loved their presents — thank you!\\" ||||| Once upon a time, Edwards' staff thought white wine and sissy sodas were their biggest problems. In anticipation of Andrew Young's 20/20 interview tonight, Gawker asks an Edwards staffer to evaluate the latest rumors—and lob some new ones.      \\"I don't think there's really any sympathy for him,\\" says our anonymous staffer, who worked on Edwards' 2004 and 2008 campaigns and says Edwards' old staff is universally \\"disgusted\\" with their former boss.      Back before they realized John was knocking up videographers while his wife lay dying, Edwards' staff worried that his beverage choices were too girly:      He had very weird soda preferences. For the longest time it was all Sprite Zero. And then at one point the word came down that he would no longer drink Sprite Zero. He would only drink Diet Orange Sunkist. And Diet Orange Sunkist can be very difficult to find on short notice. It had to be in cans. It could not be in bottles. We'd pick him up at the airport you'd have to have a cooler of that and white wine on ice.      His alcohol of choice was simultaneously elitist and tasteless...      He only drank white wine. Despite all that \\"man of the people\\" beer drinking, he preferred Sauvignon Blanc. It could be a three-dollar or a fifty-dollar bottle of wine and he would not have a clue. I don't really think he would've known the difference if you'd given him chardonnay. ... He's your classic—I hate to use this term—but he's so nouveau riche. He's totally a guy with no taste who suddenly came into a lot of money.      ...and illegal: \\"If you were driving, plastic cups were a good idea because he'd want to have a drink while you were driving him around.\\" An open container in a moving vehicle? \\"Yes.\\" Did this make you nervous, anonymous staffer? \\"Yes. Especially when he'd ask you to drive faster.\\"      The staffer says he's kept up with the leaks and recent excerpt from assistant-turned-memoirist (and early sex tape whistleblower) Andrew Young's forthcoming book, and they \\"seem pretty consistent\\" with his experience. But he admits that Young is \\"a little disconnected from reality.\\" (A passage describing Young's fear of Grisham-style retribution drew particular disbelief.) Our staffer says Edwards' lies fooled most everyone:      We all bought the spin. Until the pregnancy stuff surfaced, it wasn't that crazy a story, just a report that he had an affair with a videographer. But when the other layers came out—the child, and the timing with Elizabeth's cancer—it became more monstrous.      He adds that the National Enquirer's trashy reputation \\"aided our desire not to believe.\\" He realized the Enquirer was right in January of 2008, when a friend told him Andrew Young had a vasectomy and thus could not—as Young and Edwards claimed—be Rielle's baby daddy. The staffer is quick to note that not everyone on staff knew this. (Like, say, Edwards' spokespersons, whom he claims were unaware they were passing on lies.)      The staffer suspected Dallas donor Fred Baron of paying to support Rielle. (Baron confirmed this shortly before his death in 2008) He finds plausible Young's claim that Listerine heiress and Jackie Onassis bosom buddy Bunny Mellon's \\"Bunny money\\" also played a role:      Everybody knew about the Bunny money, though not that it was part of that [the sex scandal]. Everybody knew 'Bunny money' as this rich heiress who thought [Edwards] was the reincarnation of Robert Kennedy. You sort of pieced it together by working backwards: You hear the story about Rielle living in a house, and you know she doesn't have an income. You know that Fred [Baron] has a billion dollars, and you know Fred would do anything for John.      Asked about Edwards' recent camera-friendly trip to Haiti, the staffer comes as close to rolling his eyes as one can by telephone:      I think there is less than zero chance of him ever having a public career again. And I am absolutely positive that he will try. He's addicted to it. He needs attention. ... He was the kind of guy who'd been told all his life he was the golden child. I think that's what Rielle tapped into. She told him he was the golden child, and I think he liked to believe that.      The staffer isn't in touch with John anymore, but if he were to offer advice?       ||||| Summary:","output":"A middle-aged woman requested a sleeping bag to camp out in front of a store for the release of the new Sony gaming system.

The film is the dramatized story of Thor Heyerdahl and his Kon-Tiki expedition of 1947. While the prevailing theories of the time held that Polynesia had been settled by peoples migrating from the west, Heyerdahl, an experimental ethnographer and adventurer, sets out to prove his theory that people from South America settled the islands in pre-Columbian times. Noting similarities between statues found in South America and the Polynesian moai, Heyerdahl's theory about the origin of the Polynesian people is bolstered by Polynesian folklore that tells of an ancient tribe called the Hanau epe that are said to have once inhabited Easter Island. While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a balsawood raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1,500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 nautical mile–journey across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a macaw named Lorita). During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of sun and storm, Kon-Tiki, the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea.

Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album.

However, now the debris of Columbia and Challenger are finally on display at a new NASA exhibit in the Kennedy Space Center located in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Exhibit details The \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit serves as a tribute to the memory of the 14 astronauts who lost their lives in the deadly space shuttle disasters. The exhibit presents a range of wreckage, including a marred body panel from the Challenger, showcasing a colorful but damaged image of the US flag, and the partially burnt cockpit windows of the Columbia. The debris had been concealed in abandoned missile silos and private NASA offices until it was retrieved for the exhibit. The making of this exhibit Michael Ciannilli, a former shuttle engineer, oversaw the project of putting together the \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit. Beginning in 2015, the process of bringing the debris to light was carried out with great care, to ensure that the memories of the astronauts and the disasters were not exploited. Ciannilli said, \\"Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing.\\" The exhibit avoids any sensationalism, and there are no images of the disasters themselves. Personal artifacts To honor the personal stories of the astronauts, the dimly lit exhibit also displays personal artifacts donated by their families. Items such as the Bible and cowboy boots of Columbia Commander Rick Husband are featured, alongside the \\"TFNG\\" T-shirt of Challenger Commander Francis Scobee. These artifacts offer a glimpse into the lives of the brave individuals who ventured into space, seeking to further humankind's knowledge and understanding of the cosmos.

Summarize this article:      By Chung Min-uck      The two Koreas agreed Wednesday to hold family reunions on Feb. 20-25 at Mt. Geumgang, a scenic resort in North Korea.            The schedule for the reunions of families separated by the Korean War (1950-53) — which will be the first since October 2010 — was finalized after the South accepted a proposal by the North at a meeting in the truce village of Panmunjeom.            The timing is likely to coincide with the start of joint ROK-U.S. war games, triggering speculation that the North may use the meetings as a way to promote its claim that the two allies are preparing for an invasion.            Around 100 individuals from South Korea will participate in the family reunions and will stay at the North's Mt. Geumgang Hotel during their six-day visit, as Seoul requested, the Ministry of Unification said.            Officials here will be dispatched to the North on Friday for inspection purposes, added the ministry.            \\"The two sides have also decided to discuss — after the family reunions — other humanitarian issues, including the returning of South Koreans who were kidnapped by the North,\\" the ministry said.            Experts say the family reunions are expected to serve as a cornerstone in improving the current conflict-ridden South-North relations.            North Korea's chief delegate to the working-level Red Cross talks, Pak Yong-il, said that the latest gathering \\"is a very important starting point in improving North-South relations,\\" according to the ministry.            In response, South Korean chief delegate, Lee Duck-hang, called for \\"more mutual efforts to build trust between the South and North.\\"            Setting dates for the reunions was one of the major sticking points in negotiations.            Seoul earlier proposed launching the reunions Feb. 17, but Pyongyang rejected the idea. It instead called for a cancellation of Seoul's annual joint military exercises with Washington, dubbed Foal Eagle and Key Resolve.            But the allies refused to do so, saying that their exercises were defensive in nature.            The joint drills kick off later this month and are likely to overlap with the upcoming reunions.            Family reunions are an urgent issue because most of the separated Koreans are in their 70s and 80s.            The two Koreas have held 18 reunions since 2000, but they were halted in 2010 after relations soured in the wake of North Korea's deadly attack on a South Korean warship and an island.            Last year, the sides agreed to hold family reunions at Mt. Geumgang, but Pyongyang abruptly called them off at the last minute.            Over 20,000 separated family members here have met their relatives, but there are around 70,000 South Koreans registered to participate in the program.             ||||| 2014/02/05 16:25      By Kim Kwang-tae      SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Yonhap) -- South and North Korea agreed Wednesday to stage a new round of reunions later this month for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, an official said, a move that could help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.      The reunions -- the first since October 2010 -- will be held at Mount Kumgang, a scenic resort on North Korea's east coast, from Feb. 20 to 25, according to the text of an agreement reached at their Red Cross talks.      The deal is the first sign of progress in improving inter-Korean relations that have worsened due to the North's military threats against the South in recent months.      North Korea's chief delegate Pak Yong-Il said that the Red Cross meeting \\"is a very important starting point for improving the North-South relations.\\"            Pak made the comments at the beginning of the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom, according to a brief audio file released by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs.      The planned reunions coincide with South Korea's annual joint military exercises with Washington, which are set to run from late February through April.      North Korea has pressed South Korea to scrap the drills, condemning them as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it. Seoul and Washington have vowed to go ahead with the exercises, calling them defensive in nature.      About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War.      The North had indictated that the reunions could not be held \\"amid gunfire,\\" referring to the military drills.      The North mentioned the joint military exercises and its recent conciliatory overture at the border talks, though it did not attach a condition for the family reunions, said the unification ministry official, requesting anonymity.      Last month, the North offered a series of conciliatory gestures that called for the cancellation of the joint military drills. It also proposed halting all slander and all hostile military acts between the two Koreas.      South Korea had rejected the North's overture as a \\"deceptive\\" ploy.      On Wednesday, South Korea said it can discuss other issues with North Korea if the reunions go well.      The sides also agreed to hold Red Cross talks after the reunions to resolve humanitarian issues, in an apparent reference to South Korean prisoners of war and abductees being held in the communist country, as well as Seoul's food aid to the North.      South Korea has repeatedly called on the North to hold the reunions, calling them a first step toward improving inter-Korean relations.      Last year, the sides agreed to hold family reunions at Mount Kumgang, but Pyongyang abruptly called them off at the last minute.      Family reunions are a highly emotional issue on the divided peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.      There are no direct means of contact between ordinary civilians of the two countries that remain divided by a heavily fortified border.      The divided Koreas have held more than a dozen rounds of reunions since their landmark summit in 2000, bringing together more than 21,700 family members who had not seen each other since the Korean War.      entropy@yna.co.kr      (END) ||||| North and South Korea agreed yesterday to hold a reunion later this month for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War - the first such event for more than three years.      Officials from both sides, meeting in the border truce village of Panmunjom, decided the reunion would be held from February 20-25 at the North's Mount Kumgang resort, the South's Unification Ministry said.      The agreement marks a small sign of progress between the two rivals who, in recent years, have struggled to co-operate on even the most basic trust-building measures. However, both sides have been here before.      The two Koreas had agreed to hold a reunion last September but, even as the chosen relatives prepared to make their way to Mount Kumgang, Pyongyang cancelled the event just four days before its scheduled start, citing \\"hostility\\" from the South.      And there are widespread concerns that the families could end up being disappointed again this time around.      South Korea is due to begin joint military exercises with the United States at the end of February, and North Korea has warned of dire consequences should they go ahead.      The annual drills are always a diplomatic flashpoint on the Korean peninsula, and last year resulted in an unusually extended period of heightened military tension.      Yoo Ho-yeol, professor of North Korean Studies at Seoul's Korea University, predicted that the North would use the reunion as a bargaining chip.      \\"Rather than cancelling the event again, it may try to extract concessions, like a scaling down of the joint military exercises, or an easing of South Korean sanctions,\\" Yoo said.      Millions of Koreans were separated by the war, and the vast majority have since died without having any communication at all with surviving relatives.      Because the Korean conflict concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas technically remain at war and direct exchanges of letters or telephone calls are prohibited.      Up to 73,000 South Koreans are on a waiting list for a chance to take part in one of the reunion events, which select only a few hundred participants at a time.      The reunion programme began in earnest in 2000 following an historic inter-Korean summit. Sporadic events since then have seen around 17,000 relatives briefly reunited. But the programme was suspended in 2010 following the North's shelling of a South Korean border island.      Pyongyang is also pushing for a resumption of six-party talks on its nuclear programme - a long-stalled process involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States.      Since the beginning of the year, North Korea has been on a charm offensive, making a series of conciliatory gestures that critics have largely dismissed. ||||| Summary:","output":"North and South Korea have agreed to hold family reunions for those separated by the Korean War from February 20-25 at Mt.

The commemorative event brought together officials, dignitaries, local Chinese residents, and friends of China in Mozambique to celebrate the historic milestone that took place on July 1, 1997. The ceremony kicked off with a heartfelt speech from the Chinese Ambassador to Mozambique, who expressed his gratitude towards the Mozambican government for their unwavering support towards China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He also highlighted the importance of the One Country, Two Systems policy, which has ensured the successful reunification of Hong Kong with China. Mozambique's representative at the event applauded China's efforts in maintaining stability and development in Hong Kong and expressed their country's commitment to continuing strong diplomatic relations with China. Both parties emphasized the significance of mutual respect, cooperation, and shared development goals that have strengthened the bond between the two nations. The cultural exchange between China and Mozambique was showcased through various exciting performances and exhibitions, illustrating the rich tapestry of both countries' histories and cultural heritages. Traditional Chinese performances such as dance and music were accompanied by Mozambican arts, a clear testament to the harmony and friendship shared by the two nations. A historical photo exhibition was also held, where attendees had the opportunity to view and appreciate images that documented the journey of Hong Kong's return to China, as well as the developments and achievements of the region under Chinese rule. The event concluded with a screening of a documentary film that detailed Hong Kong's growth and opportunities since its return to China. The film highlighted the prosperous and dynamic city that Hong Kong has become, thanks to the support and leadership from the central government in Beijing. The Chinese Embassy's celebration of Hong Kong's return not only represented the enduring friendship between China and Mozambique but also served as a reminder of the pivotal moment in history when Hong Kong rejoined its motherland. The event was a testament to the strong bond between the two nations and their shared commitment to promoting peace, stability, and development for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"Mrs. Ivy recently met with state representative Frank Weddig, a Democrat from Aurora, who last year introduced a resolution condemning the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese government. In this meeting, Mrs. Ivy and Frank Weddig discussed the human rights situation of the Falun Gong practitioners in China and the ongoing persecution they face at the hands of the Chinese authorities. The conversation between the two officials aimed at raising awareness and finding potential ways to support and address these issues at the international level. The Chinese government has been accused of harsh treatment of Falun Gong practitioners over the last few decades, including a range of human rights abuses, such as forced labor, torture, organ harvesting, and even extrajudicial killings. These practitioners are targeted because of their involvement in Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that has gained a large following in China and several other countries. The Chinese government views it as a potential threat to its power and social stability, leading to a severe crackdown on these practitioners. The resolution introduced by Frank Weddig is a significant move in the fight against human rights violations in China, as it publicly condemns the treatment experienced by Falun Gong practitioners. This type of resolution not only contributes to increased awareness on the issue but could also serve as a precursor to more targeted policies and sanctions that might be enacted to pressure the Chinese government to change its approach. Furthermore, the meeting between Mrs. Ivy and Frank Weddig could foster future collaboration and further debate on this issue. By bringing together officials from different backgrounds and political affiliations, a stronger and more unified approach can be built, allowing for the possibility of enacting meaningful legislation and generating international pressure against China's policies. It is important to continue raising awareness about the plight of Falun Gong practitioners in China, urging international organizations, governments, and civil society groups to collaborate in putting an end to this ongoing persecution. Through collective action, pressure, and diplomacy, the global community may be able to influence China's policies and ultimately improve the human rights situation for Falun Gong practitioners and other oppressed groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

The EU's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states. The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations. The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation.

The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law. The \\"European Council\\" (rather than the Council, made up of different government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Russell was the biographer for?  Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \\"1949 Head\\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable.

A: The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind.  Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose your answer from: (i). yes. (ii). no.","output":"(i). yes. The study of severe weather in the Alps dates back to the 18th century. Scientists and researchers have had a long-standing interest in understanding the region's unique weather patterns, including the seasonal foehn wind. Over the years, various methods and approaches have been employed to analyze the meteorological phenomena of the Alps and develop a better understanding of their impacts on the surrounding environment and human activities. This interest in Alpine meteorology can be evidenced by the works of several notable scientists and researchers since the Age of Enlightenment in the 1700s. Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, a Swiss physicist and geologist, was one of the pioneers in Alpine meteorology. His ground-breaking work, \\"Voyages dans les Alpes\\" (Travels in the Alps, 1779-1796), documented his numerous scientific expeditions to the region and contributed significantly to the understanding of Alpine geography, geology, and meteorology at that time. Aside from De Saussure, other notable figures who contributed to the study of severe weather in the Alps include Alexander von Humboldt, Julius Hann, and Wladimir Köppen. These scientists made advancements in observational meteorology and the study of climatology during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was in the 19th century, particularly during the second half, when meteorological observation networks were established in the region. These networks collected data on temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, and precipitation patterns, which further improved the understanding of severe weather patterns in the Alps. Over time, as technology and our knowledge of atmospheric processes advanced, the study of severe weather in the Alps expanded in both scope and methodology. Researchers began to utilize satellite imagery, numerical weather prediction models, and better instruments, such as radiosondes, to study the regional weather phenomena and their impacts more accurately. In summary, the study of severe weather in the Alps has been ongoing since the 18th century, with advancements in observational data and technology enabling a deeper understanding of the region's unique weather patterns. As a result, our modern knowledge of Alpine meteorology has its roots in the early works of pioneers such as de Saussure, who took the first steps in exploring and documenting the meteorological phenomena that occur in the challenging and complex environment of the Alps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a movie seeking to tell a story, Body of Lies is a confused jumble. 3. Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year. 4. Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. 5.

To do that, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 769 (the number in front of k): 769 * k / 769 = 769 / 769 This simplifies to: k = 1 So, our final answer is k = 1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Carve a funny face into an apple. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Accomplishing the goal of carving a funny face into an apple requires several steps, including selecting the right apple, gathering the necessary tools and materials, sketching the funny face, carving, and finally adding any finishing touches. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to carve a funny face into an apple: 1. Select the right apple:     When selecting an apple, choose one with a smooth surface, ideally free of blemishes, to make the carving process easier. Opt for a larger apple to provide ample space for carving details and to make it more visually appealing. 2. Gather the necessary tools and materials:    To carve a funny face into an apple, you will need a few essential tools and materials:        - A sharp, small knife or paring knife, and possibly a hobby or carving knife for intricate details    - A cutting board or stable surface to work on    - A bowl of water mixed with a few drops of lemon juice to prevent the apple from browning    - Toothpicks or small skewers for additional support or details (optional)    - A pencil or fine-tip marker for sketching the funny face    - A clean cloth or paper towel to wipe the apple and your hands during the process 3. Sketch the funny face:     Before you begin carving, it's helpful to plan out the funny face design. You can sketch it on paper first, or you can lightly draw the outline directly onto the apple's surface with a pencil or fine-tip marker. Consider facial features like a big goofy smile, large eyes, raised eyebrows, or a comical nose for a funny appearance. 4. Carve the apple:    Begin carving by cutting into the apple with the small knife or paring knife. Follow the outline of the funny face that you drew earlier. Start by carving the larger elements like the eyes, eyebrows, or mouth. Make slow, steady, and deliberate cuts, removing small pieces at a time to avoid slicing through the entire apple or ruining the design.     When carving the features, ensure the knife is always directed away from you and your fingers. Remember that it doesn't have to be perfect; a slightly uneven or exaggerated appearance will add to the funny effect. 5. Add details and clean up:     Use a small hobby or carving knife to add smaller details such as wrinkles, teeth, or pupils. To create depth, carefully shave away thin layers of apple flesh around the features. Dispose of any excess apple pieces in the process.     As you work, occasionally dip the apple in the bowl of water mixed with lemon juice to prevent browning. Wipe the apple dry with a clean cloth after each dip. 6. Add support or additional details (optional):     If needed, you can use toothpicks or small skewers to attach additional pieces of apple to the funny face, such as ears, a tongue, or a prop like a bow tie for extra character. 7. Finishing touches:     Once you have finished carving and adding details to your funny face, give the apple a final dip in the lemon juice mixture and wipe it dry. You can now display your carved apple or take pictures to share with friends. Note that a carved apple has a limited lifespan before it starts to dry, brown, or rot, so plan to enjoy your funny face apple on the same day you create it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Forbidden Planet rates as landmark in science fiction, carefully staying within \\"hard\\" aspects of the genre (science -- not fantasy, ergo nerds will love it) while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values. Morbius's isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool, and the ultimate home appliance: Robby the Robot. \\"A housewife's dream!\\" exclaims the Captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot's abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste. Also revealing to the 1950s: Fruedian psychology rears its head in the Id explanation, although Morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept. There is a touch of the Pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer. Perhaps most timely is the post-atomic fear that Science is the enemy, and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge. Yet the suburban drama presented by Forbidden Planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci-fi genre. They aren't swashbucklers or heroes, but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman's crudeness and honesty. The good guys drive the flying saucer, and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like -- although their music er-\\"atmospheric tonalities\\" by Bebe and Louis Barron are remarkably futuristic today. The views from Morbius' house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais. The interior of the saucer is just this side of Buck Rogers. There's a lot visually to like. Although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies, Forbidden Planet is a cerebral movie, slow paced and talky. It is working on many levels at once: hard sci-fi against space adventure, philosophical against domestic.  There are many suburban touches. In spite of all their space-talk, the soldiers are dressed for the golf course. Morbius' fatal discovery is a humble educational facility, a schoolhouse. The most interesting character is Morbius' daughter Altaira. Having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew. She's a post-Madonna teen who designs her own space-age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits -- imagine Christina Aguilera with a household replicator. Men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress, but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress. Anne Francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the Leut with kisses. Alas we'll never know if she was \\"working\\" him as he suspects, since the Captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention. She is the character who makes the important change in the film. Shocked that her father compares the dead Doc to the other \\"embeciles\\" in his landing party, she turns away from her father, her home, to leave with the sailors for Earth. It's this act of defiance, of maturity, that sends Morbius' Id creature over the edge, allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the Krell.

It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that...  - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.

Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma.

The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone.  - Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as \\"subduction zones\\".

In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety.  The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run.  Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal.

Use explosives outdoors only. Give yourself, and the explosive, plenty of room to operate. Do not throw explosives at other people or animals. Fire risk is determined by the surroundings of where you set of the explosive. Strong winds or dry weather also further increase the risk of a spreading fire – explosives should not be detonated during such weather.  Do not set off the explosive near homes, sheds or other structures. Look for a site that is at least fifteen feet away from shrubs, trees or other flammable plant life. Detonate the bomb over dirt or gravel if possible. The explosion site should be surrounded by dirt and gravel for 10 feet in all directions. Once the bomb has exploded, travel to the detonation site to ensure embers are extinguished. Use water if necessary to put out kindling and cover with dirt and gravel to smother the remnants.","output":"Ensure you understand and comply with local laws regarding explosives, follow safety precautions while handling them, and only detonate them in appropriate outdoor conditions and locations to minimize fire risks and potential harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Philippe Douvier (Robert Webber), a major businessman and secretly the head of the French Connection, is suspected by his New York Mafia drug trading partners of weak leadership and improperly conducting his criminal affairs. To demonstrate otherwise, Douvier's aide Guy Algo (Tony Beckley) suggests a show of force with the murder of the famous Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers). Unfortunately for Douvier, his first attempt at bombing Clouseau fails, and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist 'Mr. Chong' (an uncredited appearance by the founder of American Kenpo, Ed Parker) is thwarted when Clouseau successfully fights him off (believing him to be Clouseau's valet Cato (Burt Kwouk), who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks). Douvier tries again by posing as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap, but the Chief Inspector's car and clothes are stolen by transvestite criminal Claude Russo (Sue Lloyd), who is unknowingly killed by Douvier's men instead. Subsequently, Douvier and the French public believe Clouseau is dead; as a result of this assumption, Clouseau's ex-boss, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is restored to sanity and is released from the lunatic asylum to perform the investigation (though he was seemingly disintegrated in the previous film). In Russo's clothes and insisting on his true identity, Clouseau is taken to the asylum himself but escapes into Dreyfus' room, who faints from the shock of seeing Clouseau alive. Clouseau manages to disguise himself as Dreyfus and is driven home by FranÃ§ois (AndrÃ© Maranne). At home, Clouseau finds Cato, who, despite having turned Clouseau's apartment into a Chinese-themed brothel, is relieved to see he survived and the two plan revenge on the sponsor of Clouseau's assassination.

The decision is a first and has similarities to cases before the courts in the US Landmark: Norrie's lawyers expect the finding will apply to other","output":"cases involving gender identity and provide a precedent for future legal battles, potentially leading to increased awareness and recognition of non-binary individuals across international jurisdictions.

This groundbreaking ruling has the potential to inspire and empower others who do not fit neatly into the male-female binary to fight for their own recognition and rights, ultimately driving society towards a more inclusive and equitable future.

I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die.

Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out.

The lions ate at the meat raw.","output":"The sentence in question, \\"The lions ate at the meat raw,\\" does not adhere to the standard rules of English grammar and syntax, making it linguistically questionable. In order to evaluate the acceptability of this sentence, we will examine its grammatical and syntactic aspects and suggest a more linguistically appropriate alternative. Let's break it down: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence, \\"the lions,\\" is correct as it is a determiner followed by a noun and is in the plural form. The subject does not pose any issues. 2. Verb: The verb \\"ate\\" functions as the main action in the sentence, indicating the process of eating. The verb form \\"ate\\" is correctly used as the past tense of the verb \\"to eat.\\" 3. Preposition: In the phrase \\"ate at the meat,\\" the preposition \\"at\\" is not necessary. In most instances, \\"eat\\" is a transitive verb, meaning that it requires a direct object to complete the action. The preposition \\"at\\" would typically be used if there were a location specified, as in \\"ate at the table.\\" In this case, with the action of eating being directed toward the meat, the preposition should be omitted. 4. Object: The object of the sentence, \\"the meat,\\" is appropriately used and is grammatically correct. 5. Adjective: The adjective \\"raw\\" is meant to describe the meat, indicating that it is uncooked. However, since it is placed after the preposition \\"at\\" in the original sentence, it disrupts the intended meaning and creates confusion. Adjectives should generally precede the noun they are modifying, or in some cases, come after the verb using a linking verb such as \\"is\\" or \\"was.\\" A more linguistically acceptable way to construct the sentence while maintaining its intended meaning would be to restructure it: \\"The lions ate the raw meat.\\" In this version, the adjective \\"raw\\" precedes the noun \\"meat,\\" which provides a clearer and more concise description of the object. Additionally, the preposition \\"at\\" is omitted, allowing for the direct object (the meat) to follow the transitive verb \\"ate.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie, the poster looks awesome so I guess I'll just have to see it  Now, \\"The Hazing\\" can somewhat be described like its alternate title: curious! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites, but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. First of all, there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched. It says: He had good grades, a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the Hazing\\". That's not the case, actually. Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship. It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only \\"buddy\\" he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith (still with hair in this film). Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious \\"Delts\\" fraternity, but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg. When Lewis returns with the other frat boys, Barney froze to death already. Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski-trip. With Barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer, Lewis has to cover for him so that Barney's absence doesn't look suspicious. The set-up of \\"The Hazing\\" is quite original and potentially innovative, but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better. The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie, even a black one, but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills, neither. The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light-headed tunes, but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy. Around an hour into the film, the plot also runs out of steam and idea, and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside. I didn't like the final twist, because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after (though admittedly after). \\"The Hazing\\" is not a complete waste of time, but still I'm glad I found an ex-rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released DVD.

In a \\"light\\" way, like Tomas; in a \\"heavy\\" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country? Unfortunately, I haven't read Kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning. I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows. 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices. 2) The \\"secondary\\" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary. 3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. 4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? 5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. 6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good. 7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the \\"metropoly\\", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I don't think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience. 8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. 9) I hated the \\"stop the music in the restaurant\\" scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it? After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two). The \\"Naked women Photoshoot\\", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed. Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally \\"designed\\" in such a way that \\"Tomas types\\" are going to like it and \\"Tereza ones\\" are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.","output":"The correct sentiment for this text is *negative*."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the speaker highlights the issue of consumer safety and their lack of familiarity with the rules governing their transactions or environment. The statement also emphasizes the shortcomings of the available legal protection mechanisms, implying that there is a need for improvement in these systems to ensure that consumers feel secure and can rely on appropriate channels when their rights are potentially violated. It is essential for businesses and regulatory bodies to address consumer concerns and make necessary efforts to improve consumer confidence. This can be achieved by ensuring that the rules governing consumer transactions and environments are transparent, easily understandable, and readily accessible. Additionally, implementing proper legal protection mechanisms that work efficiently and effectively would ultimately contribute to fostering a sense of safety among consumers. Moreover, businesses should consider adopting best practices in consumer protection and engagement. This includes providing clear, concise information on product or service features, pricing, warranty, and return policies. It also involves creating an open line of communication with customers to address grievances, resolve issues and build trust. Investing in consumer education and awareness programs can further empower consumers with knowledge and skills, giving them more confidence in their purchasing decisions and increasing their overall satisfaction. Regulatory bodies and governments should also be more proactive in closely monitoring the market, promptly addressing any misconduct, and updating rules and regulations to keep up with the changing market landscape. This would help maintain a fair and competitive market environment that promotes confidence and trust among consumers. In summary, to provide a safe and secure environment for consumers, businesses and regulatory bodies should work together in ensuring transparent rules, effective legal protection mechanisms, honest communication, and robust educational programs. These combined efforts would contribute to enhancing consumer confidence, promoting a fair market, and improving overall satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant. Why men at Bridges House called Locotus Grandpa Munster: - not enough information - Because he looked older than father time. - Because he was very strict with everyone. - Because it was his responsibility to take care of the residences. Answer:","output":"Men at Bridges House called Locutus \\"Grandpa Munster\\" because he looked older than Father Time to the adolescents living there, and they dubbed him with this nickname due to their tender sensitivity at that age. However, this nickname wasn't meant in a disrespectful way, as Locutus was a well-liked and respected Don who was firm when necessary and understanding when appropriate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You know how you have your toys, right? Some are your favorites, maybe a teddy bear or a toy car, and sometimes you like to trade them with your friends. The stock market is just like that, but for grown-ups. They trade in things called 'stocks', which are like small pieces of a company, instead of toys. On Tuesday, something interesting happened in this big 'toy box' called the US stock market. Let's talk about it. So, in the US, there are different 'toy boxes' or stock markets, and one of them is called the Nasdaq. It was not having a good time on Tuesday as it went lower. Now, you must be thinking, why did this happen?  Well, it’s because of a company named Apple. You might have heard of it because they make iPhones, iPads and a lot of other gadgets. This company is like your cool, shiny, favorite toy car in the toy box. Loads of grown-ups want a piece of it (which, remember, we call a 'stock'). But on Tuesday, Apple’s stock fell, just like when your toy car might tumble off the table if you aren't careful. When this happened, a lot of grown-ups who had Apple in their collection were a bit upset and it affected Nasdaq as well.  So, because Apple is such a big and important 'toy' in the 'toy box', when it fell, it made the whole toy box, or in grown-up terms, the Nasdaq, go a bit lower.  But remember, even if you fall sometimes when you run too fast or if your toy car falls off the table, it’s not the end of the world. You stand right back up and so does your toy car, as soon as you pick it up. Similarly, even if Apple's shares fell, they can always rise back up again. In the end, grown-ups were trading their toys all day and when the time to go home came (which is called 'close' in grown-ups language), some of them were happy because their stocks went up, and some were not that happy because their stocks, like Apple, went down. That's why we say, US stocks were mixed on Tuesday. And that's what happened, buddy. Hope you got it. Doesn't trading toys sound like fun?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal  muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Q:What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it Question: What does the author probably think? Options: - People should develop diabetes.   - People should do research in Sweden.   - not enough information   - People should eat fruit in favor of drinking fruit. === The correct answer is A:","output":"The correct answer is: People should eat fruit in favor of drinking fruit. Step 1: Read and understand the text. The text discusses the health benefits of fruits and highlights how their consumption can reduce the risk of certain diseases. It also emphasizes the importance of eating whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice. Step 2: Analyze the author's perspective. The author presents research findings and opinions to support the idea that fruit consumption is beneficial for health. The overall tone of the text reflects the author's positive view of eating whole fruits. Step 3: Evaluate the options. Option 1 suggests that the author believes people should develop diabetes, which is clearly contradictory to the text's message. Option 2 refers to doing research in Sweden, which is irrelevant to the author's main point. Option 3 states that there is not enough information, which is not true since the author presents multiple research findings and examples. Option 4, \\"People should eat fruit in favor of drinking fruit,\\" is the correct answer as it echoes the author's main point that consuming whole fruits has health benefits and is preferable over drinking fruit juice, as mentioned in the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...  Guess a valid title for it!

The German state of Bavaria said Tuesday that it is preparing for the expiration in 2015 of the copyright on Adolf Hitler's infamous memoir \\"Mein Kampf\\" by supporting the preparation of new editions with critical commentary _ including one for students.      While \\"Mein Kampf\\" isn't actually banned in Germany, Bavaria has over the years used its ownership of the copyright to block publication. But it acknowledges it won't be able to once the copyright expires, 70 years after the author's death.      Bavaria's finance minister, Markus Soeder, said the idea of a version aimed at students _ financed by the state government _ was a reaction to concerns that the book will then be freely available and could circulate without commentary among young people, German news agency dapd reported.      \\"The book will contain commentary by experts that are clearly understandable for young people and interpret the dangerous body of thought,\\" Soeder said. He added that the aim is to show \\"what a worldwide catastrophe\\" Hitler's thought led to.      Hitler wrote \\"Mein Kampf\\" _ \\"My Struggle\\" in English _ after he was jailed in Bavaria in the aftermath of the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 _ a rambling and anti-Semitic book outlining his ideology. After World War II, the Allies agreed to hand the rights to \\"Mein Kampf\\" over to the Bavarian state government.      Bavaria also is supporting preparation of a more comprehensive version with academic commentary by the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich.      The state's minister for science, Wolfgang Heubisch, said that without such editions \\"there is the danger that charlatans and neo-Nazis could take possession of this infamous work\\" after the copyright expires.      Soeder said Bavaria would fund the overall project with some (EURO)500,000 (658,000), dapd reported.      The president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Dieter Graumann, has noted that the book is already widely available on the Internet and has said he would prefer for German citizens to read annotated excerpts than access it from online sources.      The book is also easy to purchase in other countries, where Bavaria has been unable to hinder its publication due to different copyright legislation. ||||| Bavaria has announced plans to publish a specially annotated version of Adolf Hitler's manifesto Mein Kampf in an attempt to prevent neo-Nazis exploiting the book for propaganda purposes when its copyright expires in three years' time.      The racist autobiography has been effectively banned in Germany since the end of the Second World War. The state of Bavaria, which owns the copyright, has repeatedly blocked attempts to publish new editions of the book because of fears it would encourage a rebirth of the far right.      However the copyright expires at the end of 2015. Bavaria says its plan to publish a \\"commercially unattractive\\" copy is designed to prevent the book being used for propaganda.      \\"We want to make clear what nonsense it contains and what a worldwide catastrophe this dangerous body of thought led to,\\" said Markus Söder, the Bavarian Finance Minister. He said the state's version would contain additional information which would debunk and \\"demystify\\" the manifesto.      Bavaria said it would also publish a school version, an English language edition, an e-book and an audio book.      The decision follows a change of heart by Germany's Central Council of Jews. Stephan Kramer, its general secretary, recently backed the idea of publishing a scholarly edition of Mein Kampf, explaining its role in encouraging Nazism.      The internet was a reason behind his changed stance: \\"It is all the more important that young people should see the critical version when they click on to Mein Kampf on the web,\\" he said.      The decision to publish coincides with an increase in far-right violence. Last year an armed neo-Nazi hit squad was found to have carried out a series of racist murders.

News article: Harper: How will White Sox respond to Adam LaRoche drama? By now the whole world knows the basics of the Adam LaRoche story, but more stunning than the circumstances surrounding his retirement are the quotes from Chris Sale, who flatly called White Sox executive vice president Kenny Williams a liar who can’t be trusted. Among other things, Sale went so far as to practically call for Williams’ job. “Somebody walked out of those doors the other day,” Sale said, “and it was the wrong guy. Plain and simple.” As one of the best pitchers in baseball, Sale clearly has no fear of major repercussions for expressing his opinion, yet it’s still the rarest of occasions for a player to speak with such open disdain for a high-ranking executive. “That’s a nightmare there now,” was the way an exec from another MLB team put it Saturday, speaking by phone. “The White Sox would be within their rights to discipline Sale for his remarks, but the climate must be so hostile that I can’t imagine they would risk making it worse. “Plus, there must be some basis for what he said. From what I’ve read, I get the feeling Kenny Williams may have been covering for whoever complained to him originally (about the constant presence of LaRoche’s son, Drake), and it came back to bite him. “From management’s side, I think all they can really do is hope it blows over. It’s ugly and it’s embarrassing but there’s also a chance the players come together over this and play with more of a purpose if they feel they have a cause now. Or it could be a huge distraction. You just don’t know how it will play out.” Yes, it will be fascinating to watch where the White Sox go from here. There have been cases of teams bonding against management, and not just in the movies — I’m assuming everyone has seen “Major League,” right? Talk to some of the long-retired Yankees, in fact, and they’ll tell you there were times they felt that way about George Steinbrenner back during the Bronx Zoo days. Remember, it was none other than Goose Gossage who once complained to reporters about the negative environment Steinbrenner created with public criticism about the ballclub, then concluded his rant — sound familiar? — with a rather famous jab at the the Yankee owner: “And you take that upstairs to the fat man and tell him I said it.” Or there was the time catcher Rick Cerone replied just as famously with a profane two-word rebuke when Steinbrenner called him out publicly in the clubhouse following a playoff loss in 1981. “Those teams always wanted to prove something to George because of all the criticism,” Willie Randolph told me once. “But we also had the right makeup to deal with that. We had some really tough-minded guys and we had great players.” Do the White Sox have that combination? They were a major disappointment last season, going 76-86 after earning raves for their offseason moves, which included signing LaRoche, who had a terrible season. This winter they traded for Todd Frazier and Brett Lawrie, and again have high hopes. How well they play this season is the most intriguing matter to come out of the bizarre LaRoche story, but another is the issue of just who does rule the clubhouse. Players feel it’s their domain, pure and simple. In fact, one former Met told me last week that Carlos Delgado felt so strongly about it during his days in Queens that he told Jeff Wilpon more than once that the players didn’t want him lingering there. Managers tend to defer to their players about setting the rules for the clubhouse as well. However, Yankees’ GM Brian Cashman was firm in his comments on Friday as it related to the LaRoche situation, saying that would never be an issue in the Bronx. “It’s a workplace,” he said, “and there’s definitely no part of a workplace that is owned by players above the company, including the clubhouse.” Whatever the White Sox’s policy, the issue seems to be that they made some type of verbal agreement with LaRoche giving an OK to his son’s constant presence in the clubhouse — perhaps without Williams’ knowledge. No one is saying exactly why that changed, but there should have been room for compromise on both sides. If Williams inflamed the situation by thinking he could lie about the reasoning, he made a mistake but surely never anticipated being challenged so openly by a star player for intervening. Now it’s ugly and all of baseball is riveted, waiting to see how the situation is resolved. So now Ruben Tejada is a Cardinal, signing a one-year, 1.5 million deal with them on Saturday, and you can’t help but wonder if the Mets were premature in releasing him. Mets people say the Cards weren’t willing to trade for Tejada and absorb his 3 million salary, which is why they waived him, reducing their own cost to the shortstop to just 500,000. But perhaps the Cardinals were betting on the Mets doing just that. With a need for a shortstop to fill in for the injured Jhonny Peralta, the Cards eventually may have given up a prospect and traded for Tejada. For that matter, while you can’t kill the Mets too much for looking to save some money on a backup shortstop, not after they dug deep to re-sign Yoenis Cespedes, they did give up some of the “depth and flexibility” they talked so much about creating during the offseason. After all, they’re counting on Wilmer Flores in more of a super-utility role now, essentially backing up all of the infield positions. And with David Wright’s spinal stenosis creating uncertainty about how many games he’ll play, the Mets may need Flores there a lot. Now, however, Flores is the backup shortstop. For a while it looked like he’d have to start the season there, but it seems now as if Asdrubal Cabrera could be recovered from his knee injury by Opening Day. If Cabrera stays healthy, Tejada’s departure may not be significant. If not, someone like Eric Campbell may have to back up at first and third. “Tejada did give them more flexibility,” an NL scout said. “If you’re trying win a championship like they are, a couple of million dollars shouldn’t be a big deal.” The last thing the Yankees wanted was for CC Sabathia to get knocked around in spring training, and now there is real intrigue about whether they’ll give the fifth starter spot to Ivan Nova instead. After all, both Cashman and Joe Girardi continue to say it’s a true competition, and Nova has pitched much better than Sabathia so far. The Yanks had renewed hope in Sabathia, based on how well he pitched last September with a knee brace that kept his right knee from hyperextending upon landing during his delivery. Still, it hasn’t helped him recover any of his old velocity, and his fastball has been clocked at 89-90 mph so far this spring. And while Sabathia continues to talk about transforming himself into more of a finesse pitcher, this isn’t new anymore. The big lefty has been in this stage for three-to-four years now, and it’s hard to see how he suddenly finds that precision on a consistent basis. Though inconsistent himself, Nova almost certainly gives the Yankees a better chance to win every fifth day. The question is whether they’ll really be willing to put Sabathia in the bullpen. Nice to see that Mike Trout is standing his ground on the celebration issue, rather than getting on the “baseball is tired” Bryce Harper bandwagon. “I don’t try to show anybody up,” Trout told the L.A. Times last week. “Whatever somebody else does, that’s what they do. I go out there and try to respect the game. My parents always taught me to be humble.” That sounds a lot like what Michael Conforto told me last week about his feeling that sportsmanship still matters. It doesn’t mean there isn’t room for more personality or genuine emotion in the game. But playing with class is never a bad thing either. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the drama involving Adam LaRoche's retirement and the impact it has on the Chicago White Sox. Key points include: 1. Adam LaRoche's sudden retirement due to a disagreement over the presence of his son, Drake, in the clubhouse.  2.

(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. \\"It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger. I'm so happy, it's crazy,\\" the 26-year-old told reporters after reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time. \\"He's the biggest champion in the sport. He has achieved so much and is the best player in the world. To be two sets down and come back was unbelievable. I served really well. Against Djokovic I will have to come out and do the same again.\\" Federer has now lost in the quarterfinals two years in a row, being beaten by eventual runner-up Tomas Berdych in 2010. \\"Jo played great. Really from start to finish I don't remember seeing a break point after I broke him in the first game,\\" Federer said.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Tomas Berdych\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which two players did Roger Federer lose to in consecutive Wimbledon Semifinals matches?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Tomas Berdych\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Which two players did Roger Federer lose to in consecutive Wimbledon Semifinals matches?\\". According to the information from the paragraph, Federer lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a Wimbledon quarterfinal match, not a semifinal. The match against Tomas Berdych was also a quarterfinal match, not a semifinal. It is also important to note that while Berdych's match happened in 2010, Tsonga's match year isn't mentioned, so assuming they were in consecutive years based on the information provided in the text would be incorrect. Therefore, based on the information provided, we do not have the details to conclusively answer who Federer lost to in consecutive Wimbledon Semifinals matches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Two seal pups, which were believed to be the first wild grey seal twins born in the UK, are the first to be recorded in the world, it has been confirmed.\\" Article:","output":"Title: First Wild Grey Seal Twins Recorded in the World Confirmed in the UK Introduction: In a remarkable discovery in the United Kingdom, experts have confirmed the birth of the first ever recorded wild grey seal twins. The two seal pups, previously believed to be the first such twins born in the UK, have now gained global significance as the first ones recorded in the world. This fascinating event signals the importance of continued research, conservation efforts, and the role of the public in preserving the natural world. Background on Grey Seals: Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) are dynamic marine mammals found primarily in the North Atlantic, thriving in temperate and subarctic waters. The UK plays host to about 40% of the world's grey seal population, with breeding sites commonly found along the coasts of Scotland, Wales, and eastern England. Grey seal pups are known for their distinct white, fluffy fur and are generally born between September and December. Discovery of the Seal Pups: The two grey seal pups captured the attention of researchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike when they were first spotted on the coast. Originally believed to be the first wild twins born in the UK, further investigation led to the realization that they were also the first ones recorded anywhere in the world. This discovery has revealed new insights into the reproductive patterns of grey seals and highlights the significance of conservation efforts in protecting these marine mammals. Importance of Research and Conservation: This extraordinary development emphasizes the crucial role research and conservation play in preserving our natural world. As climate change and anthropogenic factors threaten wildlife across the globe, understanding the life cycles, habits, and populations of these species is imperative for ensuring their survival. In the case of grey seals, monitoring populations and tracking their breeding patterns may aid in adaptation strategies and marine conservation policies that can help safeguard their habitats. Role of the Public and Local Communities: The ultimate success of conservation and preservation efforts lies in the hands of the public, local communities, and governments that share the habitats of these incredible creatures. By promoting awareness, advocating for sustainable practices, and encouraging connection to the local ecosystem, communities can contribute to the resilience and overall well-being of these marine mammals and their habitats. Conclusion: The confirmation of the first ever recorded wild grey seal twins is a testament to the wonders that still exist in the natural world. As researchers continue to learn more about grey seals and the factors that contribute to their adaptability and successful reproduction, it's imperative that conservation efforts remain a priority – not just for these unique marine mammals, but for all wildlife across the globe. By working together, researchers, communities, and policymakers can help ensure a bright future for these fascinating and precious inhabitants of our planet."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given an input list A.

Answer the following question: Article: Empathy  lets us feel another person's pain and drives us to help. Do any other animals feel empathy? Scientists recently found that rats  do, too. Most people don't like rats. In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages  for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container  in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped  rats squeaked  to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering  friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \\"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\\" Decety said. \\"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior. But unlike those animals, rats can be ready used in laboratory studies. They will help us to learn which parts of the brain lead to empathy and helping behavior and whether empathy is natural.\\" Question: Which of the following animals were NOT mentioned in the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Cats.\\"? Answer:","output":"The passage mentions rats, monkeys, and chimpanzees but does not mention cats. Therefore, the answer is \\"Yes,\\" since cats are not mentioned in the passage. The study discussed in the article focused on rats and their empathetic behaviors, thus excluding other animals like cats. Additionally, the experiment aimed to determine how rats would act toward their partners when placed in a stressful situation. The results indicated that rats do feel empathy for one another, as they attempted to save their trapped friends and prioritize their well-being over their favorite chocolate treats. Furthermore, the passage emphasizes the importance of studying empathetic behavior in animals and understanding the neurological basis for empathy. It mentions that rats, unlike monkeys and chimpanzees, can be readily used for laboratory studies due to their accessibility and ease of handling. This is expected to help scientists discover the specific brain mechanisms responsible for empathy and determine whether this emotion is innate or acquired. Interestingly, the study also observed differences in empathy levels between male and female rats, with females exhibiting more empathetic behaviors than their male counterparts. This suggests that there might be variations in empathy expression depending on factors such as sex or gender. In conclusion, the passage does not mention \\"cats\\" as one of the animals involved in the study or as part of the conversation regarding animal empathy. The focus lies primarily on rats and their empathetic capacity, which has gathered scientists' interest to further understand the neurological foundations of empathy and compassionate behavior in animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was always stressed from her studies, pressure and job, so she would go out, most oftenly with me, to places and times we shouldn’t have been. She would just decide, in the middle of the night, even as early as 2 in the morning that we should just race the city, see places… She always had those cravings to do stuff at strange times, getting to sport events with me at the other bit of the country… This crazy kind of life got us in a big lot of troubles. People trying rape her, attack us and much many more. it was happening too often and I often had to be quite violent to these people so she stays in one piece. I had to fix a lot of crap in order for her to live fully her fantasy. But I was more worried for her than me and I wanted us settle down, calm and have children we could raise peacefully. There was that one night where, we both came back very late from a sport competition, we had to travel dangerous roads very late at night sometimes by bus, foot and other times subway. At one point that night, two drug addicts tried to rape her, so I did what I had to do, but still I didn’t kill them. Then I shoved her and I really mean shove, inside a taxi, got in there too and asked it back home. When I arrived, she was denying the danger, denying anything wrong with her way to behave.

After years of production troubles and repeated delays, a controversial biopic about legendary jazz singer and Civil Rights icon Nina Simone is finally due to hit theaters next month — and a lot of people have made it clear that they won’t be seeing it. The backlash against director Cynthia Mort’s “Nina” has been particularly sharp since it was announced in 2012 that the light-skinned Zoe Saldana, who is Dominican and Puerto Rican, would play Simone. The choice sparked an onslaught of infuriated blog posts, calls for a boycott and even a petition for a casting change. [Zoe Saldana’s casting in Nina Simone biopic causing Twitter, blogger and commenter outcry] That outrage was renewed this week after Entertainment Weekly released an official movie poster and trailer for the film, which showed Saldana in skin-darkening makeup and a prosthetic nose. This did not go over well in the Twitterverse. zoe saldana looks foolish at nina simone. foolish. — Tracy Clayton (@brokeymcpoverty) March 1, 2016 I did theater. I love theater. I'm still not giving a pass on Blackface so that we can pretend Zoe was better qualified than anyone else. — Mikki Kendall (@Karnythia) March 2, 2016 Simone’s daughter, actress and singer Lisa Simone Kelly, has vocally disavowed the film for years. In 2012, Simone Kelly told the New York Times that she respected Saldana but was disappointed by the choice to cast her in the role. “My mother was raised at a time when she was told her nose was too wide, her skin was too dark,” Simone Kelly told the Times. “Appearance-wise this is not the best choice.” She has also voiced anger that her family was excluded from the biopic’s production process. “How does someone just decide to do a story about someone and completely bypass family?” she said in a 2012 interview with Ebony Magazine. Simone Kelly instead threw her support behind the critically acclaimed, Oscar-nominated documentary “What Happened, Miss Simone?” which she said captures the full, tragic scope of her mother’s life and the way her career was shaped by racism. Humor writer and blogger Luvvie Ajayi was among those who said she would skip the film in solidarity with Simone Kelly. “Maybe I’m just being a hater but this is a terrible choice, in my opinion. I won’t be supporting this movie. Not just because Zoe’s clearly a bad casting decision, but because Nina Simone’s own daughter is sternly against it for many reasons (and they’re justifiable),” Luvvie wrote. “They can keep this one.” The movie is set to debut in theaters April 22. On Nina Simone’s official Facebook page, Simone Kelly encouraged her mother’s fans to make other plans instead: “We can use this date as an other opportunity to celebrate Nina’s life and music,” she wrote, urging fans to host listening parties or screen “What Happened, Miss Simone?” “Nothing can diminish Nina or her legacy,” she said in the post. “No one can rob Nina of her gift — or rob us of the gift she shared with us.” You can watch the trailer for “Nina” here. Caitlin Gibson is a feature writer at The Washington Post.","output":"A movie about the famous singer Nina Simone is coming to theaters next month, but some people are not happy about it. They don't like that the actress playing Nina Simone, Zoe Saldana, had her skin darkened and wore a fake nose to look more like her. Even Nina Simone's daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, is not happy about the movie and wants people to stay home instead of going to see it. She thinks another movie, called \\"What Happened, Miss Simone?\\", does a better job of telling her mother's story."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Zacharo is a town and municipality in southwestern Greece.

And I was wondering How would Aubrey feel afterwards? A:","output":"Memories of Remy running through Aubrey's mind after his death would likely evoke a complex mixture of emotions for Aubrey. It is essential to note that every person's grief and coping mechanisms are unique. However, given the close relationship between Aubrey and Remy, some common feelings that might arise are: 1. Sadness: The most immediate and intense emotion Aubrey would experience upon reminiscing about Remy would be profound sadness. The realization that Remy is no longer around to share new memories, moments of joy, or even mundane daily exchanges would be overwhelming. This feeling may intensify when recalling favorite memories and the special qualities that made Remy a significant person in Aubrey's life. 2. Regret: Aubrey might feel regret for moments or opportunities missed with Remy. This could be reflecting on chances to express their feelings or appreciation, to say sorry, or to clear misunderstandings. It is not uncommon for people to wish they had \\"one more moment\\" with a loved one to convey these sentiments. 3. Guilt: Guilt might arise if Aubrey feels responsible for Remy's death, or if there were unresolved conflicts between them before Remy's passing. Even if not directly related to the cause of death, Aubrey might blame themselves for not being there or not taking better care of Remy. 4. Nostalgia: As memories resurface, Aubrey may feel a sense of nostalgia and longing for the past. This could manifest in reminiscing about the good times they shared, recalling Remy's mannerisms, inside jokes, and unique traits that provided happiness and comfort to their relationship. 5. Anger: It is not uncommon for grief to be accompanied by feelings of anger or frustration. Aubrey might feel anger towards the circumstances that led to Remy's death or even towards Remy for leaving them behind. This anger can be challenging to reconcile, as it might be conflicting with other emotions such as love and sadness. 6. Loneliness: Losing someone close often leads to loneliness, as the person who filled a significant role in one's life is no longer there. Aubrey could feel isolated in their grief, even when surrounded by others, as the unique bond with Remy cannot be replicated. 7. Gratitude: Amid the pain, Aubrey might also feel gratitude for the times they shared and the memories that Remy left behind. This could serve as a reminder of the cherished moments and the positive impact Remy had on their life. 8. Acceptance: Over time, as Aubrey heals and learns to cope with the loss, they may come to accept Remy's passing. This acceptance does not erase the pain but may help Aubrey find a new way of holding onto the memories and honoring Remy's life without being entirely consumed by grief. While it is crucial to understand these potential emotions, it is equally important to remember that the grieving process is not linear and may involve Aubrey experiencing different emotions at various times. Ultimately, how Aubrey feels after Remy's death will depend on factors such as their personal coping mechanisms, the support system available, and the circumstances surrounding Remy's passing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Police have revealed they still have no suspects or leads in the case of a missing pregnant woman who mysteriously disappeared without trace more than a week ago. Hawaiian woman Carly Scott was reported missing on February 10 by her mother and was last seen at her sister's home in Haiku on the island of Maui at 8pm the night before. Family members said Scott, who is five months pregnant, left her sister's house to help her ex-boyfriend Steve Capobianco whose car had broken down on Hana Highway, near the eastern shore of the island. Her abandoned and torched truck was found in a dirt track a few days later, along with some of her belongings, but there's still no trace of her. Scroll down for video. No trace: Charli Scott, who is pregnant, was last seen on Sunday night. Officers have so far interviewed people who last had contact with the 27-year-old including her ex-boyfriend who apparently failed a lie detector test - but so far they have no suspects. Speaking at a press conference, Capt. Jakubczak said the investigation continues to be classified as a missing person's case. He said: 'We. encourage the community, the public, to call with any information they. have no matter how minute or how small they believe it is because we'll. follow up on every lead or tip.' Last. Wednesday, Scott's SUV was found torched and was found abandoned on a dirt track. Jakubczak said a private. search party found clothing and other items the following day that. Scott's family identified as belonging to her. Police have the items and. were processing them, he said. Maui. police were also looking for another missing woman, Moreira Monsalve,. who was last seen in January. Jakubczak said there's no evidence the. cases are connected, though they are similar. Monsalve, 46, was also. last seen by her ex-boyfriend. Abandoned: Miss Scott's car was found burnt out and on its side several days after her disappearance. Mystery: Miss Scott's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend. A team of 50 to 70 volunteers and family members have been searching for Scott since her mother reported her missing. In an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now last week Capobianco said: 'She picked me up from my house at 8:30pm, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,' 'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rear-view the entire time.' Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning. The following day Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30am. by police knocking on his door. They told him Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother. Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test. 'The police told me I failed,' Capobianco said. 'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.' But Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa urged the public to allow investigators to do their job. 'Even. though there's an urgency to try and solve these cases, one has to be. very, very patient, those in our community have to be patient, to allow. that process to evolve,' he said. 'Otherwise, we'll jeopardize the. potential of being able to use whatever evidence is being found.' Scott's. mother, Kimberlyn Scott, told the Maui News that. the family would be 'taking a breather' and wouldn't be actively. searching Tuesday. The team. has been conducting daily searches from Haiku to Hana, by foot, on. motorcycles and on all-terrain vehicles. They are armed with maps of the. island and donated support including search dogs and a drone that took. pictures and video of unreachable cliffs and ravines. Red-head Scott, who goes by the nickname Charli, was born in Woodland, California,. grew up in Sacramento and moved to Maui about 10 years ago. Her father, Robert Scott, flew in from Seattle last week. More than a dozen relatives have flown in from the mainland. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

There is no need to stay elsewhere. You want to talk about the \\"prime\\" location, it doesnt get better than this. Right smack in the middle of the strip, easy access to anywhere.  From the moment my G.F. arrived, the staff is very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room we booked was ready (did not book a strip view because I was going to try for a room upgrade). I cant remember the guys name at the front desk that we had, but when I asked for a room upgrade, he did not hesitate at all and gladly upgraded us. We just had to wait a few hours because the room was not ready. We had no problem with that because that gave us some time to go get some lunch. By the time we were done eating, our room was ready.  The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and even though the tv was acting up a tad, no complaints at all with the Mirage. The hotel/casino is very easy to navigate.   The Mirage pool is the king of pools. Staying at the Mirage just for the pool is worth it. When you see it you completely forget you are in the middle of the desert. It is a complete relaxation atmosphere. The water is the perfect temperature. Especially when you are sitting in the Vegas sun, you just go right into the pool and lounge around. The water temperature is absolutely perfect!  The pool area fills in very quickly, so if you want a good seat in the prime real estate, make sure to get there as soon as the pool opens. Being there early is totally worth it. A lot of people save chairs for others, and a lot of chairs just sit there with towels on them with noone using them so just scope out the area and wait until you see someone get up. We got to the pool late one day and some little, friendly old lady had saved 7 seats!!! and she was there alone, but when the guy next to her left, she moved over to the end of the row. It was actually really funny to hear talk on the phone and say she had taken 7 seats. As we saw this guy leaving, we walked over and with no hesitation she gladly gave up 2 of her seats for us.   Not to mention, there are some good food spots for quick eats in the hotel, including BLT burger, Carnegie and Blizz frozen yogurt. When you find a good spot, you stick with it, and both times I have not had any issues with the Mirage. This is my hotel choice and will not even think about staying elsewhere.

Do you know what manicures and pedicures are? They are special treatments that some grown-ups like to get for their hands and feet. But guess what? It's not very good to get them done too often. Let me tell you why! Manicures and pedicures involve cleaning and shaping your nails, removing any dead skin, and painting them with pretty colors! It's like going to a special spa just for your hands and feet. But when you go too frequently, it can cause some problems. Here are three reasons why. 1. Keep Your Nails Healthy: Imagine if you kept rubbing a crayon on your favorite book. Eventually, your book would become weak, right? Just like that, when people get manicures and pedicures too often, it can weaken their nails. They might start to peel or break more easily. Our nails need time to grow strong and nice! 2. Avoid Infections: You know how sometimes, when you get a boo-boo, your mom or dad puts a bandage on it to keep it clean? Well, if people don't clean their nail tools properly, germs and bad things can spread from one person to another. By visiting a nail salon less often, you can lower the chance of getting an infection. Plus, it's important to make sure the place you go to is very clean, just like your room after you tidy up! 3. Save Your Money: Do you have a piggy bank? Manicures and pedicures can cost a lot of grown-up money. By not getting them done too often, you can save money for other fun things, like going to the movies or buying that toy you really wanted! So, little buddy, it's important not to go for manicures and pedicures all the time. Instead, you can try doing them at home with your family or friends for a fun activity! This way, you can make sure your nails stay healthy and strong, avoid any boo-boos, and save your grown-up money for other cool things. Now go and show off your beautiful nails!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Read this: Adherents of different religions generally disagree as to how to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What is one called that believes he has the one religion, but that the others aren't necessarily wrong?","output":"A person who believes that they have the one true religion but also accepts that other religions might have some truth or validity can be called a religious pluralist.

These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let's have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn't start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \\"voice\\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not!

Answer the following question: Given the background: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...  and the situation: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the title of this article: Statistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \\"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\\".

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin.  Would case D population be at smaller or larger risk of vitamin D deficiency than case L population?  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.","output":"To determine if case D population (darker skin) would be at a smaller or larger risk of vitamin D deficiency than case L population (lighter skin), let's go through the information provided step-by-step. 1. Melanocytes in the epidermis produce melanin, which gives skin its color. 2. People with darker skin (case D) have melanocytes that produce more melanin compared to those with lighter skin (case L). 3. The amount of melanin is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light. 4. Exposure to UV light stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. 5. Melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, thus affecting vitamin D production. From this information, we can understand that: - Since case D population has a higher melanin production, their skin blocks more UV light from penetrating. - Limited penetration of UV light to the skin would mean less stimulation for vitamin D production. Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that the case D population (darker skin) would be at a larger risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to the case L population (lighter skin). This is due to the higher melanin content blocking more UV light, resulting in reduced vitamin D production in individuals with darker skin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reason behind that is the more softened wax available, the more worker bees can use it to build and maintain the honeycomb structure. A larger hive can accommodate a higher population of bees and store more honey, pollen, and nectar. When a hive grows in size, it can support more bees that, in turn, forage for nectar, collect pollen, and produce more honey. This is particularly essential during the peak of the flowering season, as the colony needs to maximise its storage capacity to ensure there is enough food to sustain the population during times of scarcity. A larger hive also provides better protection against external threats and helps the colony maintain a stable internal temperature, which is essential for honey production and the survival of the brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae). It can also improve the overall efficiency of the colony, allowing for more specialized roles to be assigned, supporting the various tasks involved in the hive's maintenance. In conclusion, if more wax is softened, it will positively impact a larger hive's growth and capacity.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.  Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where..., what would be the answer ?

Movie title: The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery Context: The voice of Archie Goodwin (Timothy Hutton) introduces us to the seventh-of-a-ton master sleuth Nero Wolfe (Maury Chaykin) â \\"a man who thinks he's the world's greatest detective. Truth being, he is.\\" Wolfe lives in an opulent Manhattan brownstone on West 35th Street, where he enjoys reading, the cultivation of rare orchids, beer, and fine food prepared by his resident chef, Fritz Brenner (Colin Fox). The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe's confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank â but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos (Robert Clark), who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket â cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip. About an hour before, Pete saw a good-looking woman wearing large gold earrings shaped like spiders, at the wheel of a 1952 Cadillac. As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, \\"Help. Get a cop.\\" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50. Wolfe instructs Archie to call the police, to suggest they do a routine check on the license plate number, and Pete hurries home to his mother. The next evening Sergeant Purley Stebbins (R. D.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, states, \\"Egypt embraced their new status and their new Roman rulers.\\" This sentence implies not just acknowledgment of the new political situation, but also suggests a positive acceptance or welcoming of this new reality by the Egyptians. To entailed means, in the context of logic and reasoning, that the truth of the first statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of the second (the hypothesis). In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must necessarily also be true.  However, in the case of these two sentences, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While the first declaration informs us about a change in Egypt's political status (from being an independent entity to a province within a larger empire), it gives no information about how this change was perceived or accepted by the Egyptian people. The Egyptians could have embraced the change, as suggested by the hypothesis, but they may have equally resisted or simply endured it. To infer the truthfulness of the hypothesis from the given premise, we would require additional information. For instance, historical documents, records, or evidences suggesting that the Egyptians were welcoming towards their new Roman rulers, or that they took advantage of new opportunities provided by their provincial status would support the hypothesis. In conclusion, based solely on the premise given, we cannot assert the truth of the hypothesis that \\"Egypt embraced their new status and their new Roman rulers.\\" The premise does not provide sufficient evidence to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The information provided in the premise is independent of the sentiment expressed in the hypothesis.

The 17-year-old girl defeated champion Serena Williams  6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships.     A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion.     Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years.     Not even Anna Kournikova evoked  such passion when she broke on to the scene. To look good on court is one thing, but Sharapova can actually play the game too. Extremely well.

Movie title: A Christmas Carol Movie plot: Old Ebenezer Scrooge is a cruel man for whom life's only passion has become only money; he hates Christmas, even the very mention of it, lives alone and only to work. He is very strict with his only, underpaid and overworked, employee, Bob Cratchit, and does not believe in giving away to charity or being kind to anyone. One Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge receives a ghostly visit from his long deceased partner Jacob Marley, who had died exactly seven years before on that same day. In his life, Jacob Marley had been just as selfish and uncaring as Scrooge was now. He tells Ebenezer about how his soul has not had a moment's rest since his death and how his spirit has been doomed to wander the earth looking down at what might have been, had he been a different man. He tells Scrooge that he wants to spare him that same fate, and that on that night, he will receive the visits of three spirits. After Jacob departs, Scrooge heads for his bed with no intention of having his sleep be interrupted by anyone. Still, precisely as Jacob Marley had predicted, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives at one o'clock. He and Scrooge depart together for the Christmases that have already been, and from the experience, Scrooge gains a painful memory of the person he was, and how he became what he is today. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shares with Scrooge the Christmases being celebrated on that same year, especially the merriment being had at his nephew Fred's home; Fred had invited him to dinner, and Scrooge, as usual, had declined the invitation. From this experience, Scrooge also learns about Bob Cratchit's family, and how his youngest son, Tiny Tim, is a fragile creature supported by a crutch who may be doomed to die unless he receives better nourishment, more than his father can provide.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. It is important to keep a balance between staying in touch with home and working to establish a new community where you are. Strike up conversations with people who seem interesting. This might be someone in your dorm or someone in one of your classes.  The first few days or weeks of college, summer camp, or studying abroad can be a great opportunity to make friends. Take advantage of situations where you're not the only new person around. If you're studying or working in a different country, try a local consulate, expatriate society, or university international society to find other people who are sharing your experience of being away from home. Talking about feelings of unhappiness with people who are sharing your experiences can be helpful.  Think about taking up a hobby or joining a club. Or, you can volunteer with a local nonprofit organization. These are great ways to find people with common interests. Keeping yourself in your past home or place may keep you from accomplishing goals in your new place or establishing new connections and friendships. Sometimes when we are away from home, our daily routine and even habits might change.  This type of change makes the new environment seem even more foreign. To help prevent large changes like this, try to continue some of your familiar habits, even in your new place. For instance, if you have moved away for college and are missing Taco Tuesday nights with your family, try to implement a new Taco Tuesday with your dorm roommates or new group of friends. Or if you are away on summer camp and you do certain things to prepare for bed every night, try to continue this routine. These type of routines often offer structure and familiarity, so try to add some of these into your new environment. Step outside with your camera or smart phone. A camera can be a great way to see your new location in a new light. By keeping your mind active and focused on your new surroundings, you can turn your attention away from homesickness. It's also a great way to document your experiences while away from home. To get the most out of your experience, particularly if you're living abroad, break out of your comfortable cocoon and try new things.  For example, try new foods. Food can often be the most defining element of a culture. Trying the local foods and finding something that the natives eat that you also enjoy can go a long way towards making you feel comfortable in a new place. Go to cultural events. Even if you are away at college in a different state, you can still sample the different cultural events that you might not get in your hometown. Culture shock involves feelings of confusion, doubt, or nervousness caused by being in a new place. This can be especially hard for people living in a new country, but it can also happen if someone moves away to college in a city from a rural area. The trick is not to let it get the better of you. In particular, if you're living abroad, try these strategies to help overcome culture shock:  Learn the rules of living in your host country. Try to understand how and why the local people act the way they do. Their behavior and customs may be different from your own, but they are probably typical for the area. Take time to learn the language. It always helps to understand as much as possible of what people are saying. They will appreciate your effort to communicate with them in their language, even if it is just a few simple phrases, and it will make your daily life much easier. Approach the experience with a positive attitude and an open mind.  Approaching your experience as an adventure is likely to help you have a good experience. Summary:","output":"1. Balance staying in touch with home and establishing a new community. 2. Strike up conversations with interesting people around you. 3.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS: (a). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. (b). use just water to cleanse. (c). use abrasive soap. (d). not enough information. Answer:","output":"(a). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to do so, he leaves the classroom with two beakers filled with the same type of gas. He goes to the kitchen and heats one beaker up on the stove, but does nothing to the other beaker. He then returns to the classroom and has the students examine the gases. The students observe that the kinetic in beaker G is higher than that of the gas in beaker R.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which beaker did the teacher place on the stove?  Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.

Review: I sit through movies like \\"Tiempo de valientes\\" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. The admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because I'm watching the scenes of the film and I search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than Damian Szifron's mind.Looking the environment, so uncompromised, so simple, I'm thinking; this man is a genius. No wonder he created what is probably the best television show Argentina ever witnessed, and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven't still achieved. \\"El fondo del mar\\" is the name and, it awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema.Starting his journey from people's daily real lives, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never could in \\"El Bonaerense\\"; the Federal Police Department's life. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations, but Szifron in \\"in there\\", his is more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with the mysteries and the thrilling music.But there's a lot of humanity in his writing, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him; and has to work on a case.The second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins Díaz in his routines: \\"It's nothing, the usual stuff; no problem\\". But it is bigger than that, and it will unfold a part of the doctor's personality he didn't know.The relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless it is observed, because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like Szifron that are trying, today, to leave a signature in our history. Reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity, during a high pressure situation, Díaz tells Silverstein: \\"How do we continue our treatment?\\", and Silverstein answers: \\"No, I'm not your doctor. You call me to have dinner; I'm your friend\\": we laugh because we can't help it.And we can't help laughing when Díaz crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it, or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and Silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes it too because he's screwed up); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with Díaz's robber friends. Magic from Diego Peretti is what we receive there. He, a psychiatrist himself, gives a performance in plan \\"Locas de amor\\", but impresses with all his range. Luis Luque on the other hand, is back on track with a top-notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is.There's a passion I have for this, and as I said, I could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not the way it works and I have to be precise and summarize. Although I have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them, I could assure that \\"Tiempo de valientes\\" is the comedy Argentina had been waiting for and never gotUntil now.

I read this background article the other day: Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.  I am facing a new situation today: David was working in his chemistry lab. He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would sample A1 have less or more isotopes than sample A? A:","output":"Sample A1 would have less isotopes than sample A.  The concept of half-life in radioactive decay refers to the time it takes for half of a certain quantity of a radioactive substance (in this case, the isotopes in sample A) to decay. This process results in a reduction of the radioactive isotope's quantity in a predictable manner.  In the case of sample A, when one half-life has passed (to create sample A1), half of the isotopes would have decayed. This essentially means that the quantity of the isotopes in sample A1 would be 50% less than the original quantity in sample A.  To explain this numerically, if we suppose that there were 100 isotopes in the initial sample A, after one half-life (when we have sample A1), there would be 50 isotopes remaining. So, sample A1, which represents the isotope quantity after one half-life has occurred, would have fewer isotopes than the original sample A. However, when two half-lives have passed and David looks at sample A2, the quantity would have halved again. So, using the previous numbers, the 50 isotopes in sample A1 would reduce to 25 isotopes in sample A2, demonstrating the continuous exponential decay process of radioactive substances.  Since Sample A had a longer half-life and sample B had a shorter one, sample B would decay more quickly than sample A, with a greater proportion of its isotopes decaying over the same period of time. Therefore, if David was to take a similar measurement of isotopes B after one and two half-lives, he would observe a more dramatic reduction in isotope quantity compared to sample A due to its shorter half-life period.  In summary, radioactive half-life works predictably, and knowing the half-life of a radioactive substance allows us to forecast its decay and the accompanying reduction in quantity of the radioactive isotopes over time. Therefore, sample A1 certainly has fewer isotopes than the original sample A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Sentence 1: The speaker is commenting on how the laws in Texas are structured, specifically regarding self-defense and the use of a firearm. The speaker claims that they cannot shoot someone for simply entering their property. However, if the person is physically inside their house, the law allows for use of force if the resident feels threatened. In the given example, the speaker implies that encountering an intruder in their living room at 2 AM would make them feel threatened and, as a result, they would resort to using their firearm for self-defense. Sentence 2: This sentence can be interpreted as a simplified version of the self-defense law in the specific context of the first sentence, focusing on the right to use a firearm when one's house is entered by an uninvited individual. However, it does not explicitly mention the requirement of feeling threatened as a prerequisite for defensive action. Given the information provided in Sentence 1, we can establish that Sentence 2 is true in the context of the speaker's rights to shoot an intruder within their house, but with the important caveat that they need to feel that their life is being threatened. Sentence 2 does not provide the complete conditions for using a firearm in self-defense as described by the law, but it remains consistent with the general idea that the speaker can, in fact, shoot an intruder once they are inside their house."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"The Lacey Act of 1900 was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"What did the first federal wildlife commerce law prohibit?\\"","output":"Yes, \\"The Lacey Act of 1900 was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets.\\" contains the correct answer to \\"What did the first federal wildlife commerce law prohibit?\\" However, to provide a detailed and long answer, let's delve deeper into the purpose and provisions of the Lacey Act of 1900. The Lacey Act of 1900, named after Congressman John F. Lacey of Iowa, was the first federal law in the United States aimed at regulating commercial animal markets and protecting wildlife. It was enacted to preserve the country's natural resources by curbing the illegal trafficking of wild animals and plants, which also helped maintain ecological balance throughout the country. The act has been amended several times since its inception to expand its scope and cover a broader range of species, as well as plants. The main provisions of the Lacey Act can be summarized as follows: 1. Prohibition of interstate trade in wildlife and plants, taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of state, federal, tribal, or foreign laws: The act forbids the sale and transport of wildlife and plants deemed illegal under existing laws, thereby addressing the issue of wildlife and plant trafficking across state and national borders. 2. Protection of non-native species: The Lacey Act prohibits the importation and interstate commerce of non-native species that have been designated as \\"injurious wildlife\\" by the Secretary of the Interior. The introduction of non-native species can pose significant threats to native ecosystems, as it can disrupt delicate food chains and cause the decline of native species populations. This provision aims to minimize the risk of such introductions. 3. Regulation of commercial animal markets: The act regulates the commercial trade of protected wildlife by requiring businesses and individuals dealing with certain protected species to obtain permits. This helps to ensure that only legally obtained animals and plants are commercially traded. 4. Penalties: Violations of the Lacey Act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties. The severity of these penalties depends on the nature of the offense, the value of the wildlife or plant involved, and whether the violator is operating as an individual or a corporation. Additionally, the act allows for the seizure of any illegally obtained wildlife, plants, or their products, as well as the equipment and vehicles used in their trafficking. 5. International cooperation: The Lacey Act covers not only violations of U.S. federal and state laws, but also violations of foreign laws that protect wildlife and plants. This allows for better international coordination in combating wildlife and plant trafficking. In conclusion, \\"The Lacey Act of 1900 was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets\\" provides an answer to the question \\"What did the first federal wildlife commerce law prohibit?\\" However, it is important to note that the Lacey Act's scope extends beyond regulating commercial animal markets. It also seeks to preserve natural resources and maintain ecological balance by prohibiting interstate and international trafficking of illegal wildlife and plants, regulating the importation of non-native species, enforcing penalties for violators, and fostering international cooperation in wildlife and plant protection efforts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Early diagnosis and management of low hemoglobin levels may help prevent complications and improve your overall quality of life. Importance of Hemoglobin Level Testing Regular hemoglobin testing is essential in maintaining good health and well-being. A routine blood test can determine the amount of hemoglobin present in your body. The normal range for hemoglobin levels is generally between 12 to 16 g/dL for women and 14 to 18 g/dL for men. Levels below the normal range suggest the possibility of anemia or other related health conditions. Testing is particularly important for individuals with a family history of anemia, pregnant women, and those who have undergone significant blood loss (either from an injury or medical procedure). Routine testing helps in early detection, allowing healthcare providers to devise a treatment plan tailored to the individual's needs. It is essential to talk to your doctor about the recommended frequency of hemoglobin level tests based on your specific situation. Medical Conditions That May Cause Low Hemoglobin Low hemoglobin levels may result from various medical conditions or factors, some of which include: 1. Iron-deficiency anemia: Inadequate iron intake is the leading cause of low hemoglobin. A diet low in iron can lead to the depletion of hemoglobin levels, impairing oxygen transport in the body. 2. Vitamin-deficiency anemia: Insufficient intake of vitamin B12 and folic acid can lead to decreased hemoglobin production. A well-balanced diet, including foods rich in these vitamins, can help maintain healthy hemoglobin levels. 3. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than they are produced by the body. Hemolytic anemia can be inherited or result from infections, autoimmune disorders, or specific medications. 4. Aplastic anemia: The failure of the bone marrow to produce enough red blood cells can lead to low hemoglobin levels. Causes of aplastic anemia include radiation, chemotherapy, or bone marrow-related diseases. 5. Sickle cell anemia: This inherited disease causes the red blood cells to develop a crescent or sickle shape, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and low hemoglobin levels. 6. Chronic kidney disease: Kidneys play a crucial role in stimulating red blood cell production. When the kidneys are not functioning optimally, as is the case in chronic kidney disease, red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels may decline. 7. Cancer and chemotherapy: Both cancer itself and chemotherapy treatments can affect bone marrow function, resulting in low hemoglobin levels. Conclusion Understanding the symptoms of low hemoglobin levels, the importance of regular hemoglobin level testing, and the underlying medical conditions that may cause low hemoglobin levels are vital in maintaining good health. Remember to consult your healthcare provider if you experience any symptoms or have concerns about your hemoglobin levels. Early detection and treatment can help prevent complications and improve your overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies.  A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother.  given a new species of animal is helpless at birth, it needs constant attention and care from a parent and is completely defensive, will this animal be categorized as precocial or altricial?

For the UK, it is forecasting growth of just 0.7%, after saying in January that the country's economy could expect 1% growth. The figure is slightly above the 0.6% growth forecast in last month's Budget. That figure came from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF's World Economic Outlook report also cut its forecast for the eurozone this year to -0.3%, with Germany, the strongest economy, expected to grow by 0.6%, but France on course to shrink by 0.1%.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

Movie title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

The sad and disturbing fact of \\"Boom\\" is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with \\"Modesty Blaise\\" and \\"Boom\\" (some may wish to add \\"Secret Ceremony\\"), managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work, the wonderful \\"Go-Between\\". Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid forties until the early sixties, Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status, remaining in theater repertory throughout the world, many becoming much praised films. When William's muse deserted him, probably owing to his notorious substance abuse, it deserted him for good. Williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances. (Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in \\"Night of the Iguana\\" ? ) Taylor in particular, shone in both \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\". There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied \\"if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams\\". Had Gielgud seen \\"Boom\\" he would have held his tongue. Taylor simply has never been worse, turning in a cringe inducing performance. Despite her face photographing well, she is decidedly podgy. Besides the physical decline, from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable (and worse) roles to her credit. Much the same could be said of Burton. Following his short lived theatrical stardom, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point onwards (1968) would be unremarkable to say the least. Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British \\"angry young men\\".

They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? A) Trees gain a growth ring each day. B) Trees also have otoliths. C) Their growth rings are very small. D) They both have growth rings.","output":"The writer compares fish to trees because D) They both have growth rings.

These CO2 molecules trap heat that would otherwise escape into space, leading to the warming of the Earth's surface, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.  Over time, this causes an increase in Earth's average temperature, known as global warming. Moreover, when Earth's temperature rises, it leads to the melting of polar ice caps, which in turn, accelerates the warming since the white reflective ice is replaced by dark water or land that absorbs more heat. This feedback loop can cause the temperature to rise even faster. Therefore, if more coal is needed and burnt during the winter, it would likely lead to more CO2 emissions, amplifying the greenhouse effect and causing Earth's temperature to rise more than it would have otherwise.  It's worth noting that increased demand for coal and other fossil fuels in winter is a common issue, as colder temperatures often lead to higher energy uses for heating homes and other buildings. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming often focus on finding more sustainable, low-carbon sources of energy and improving energy efficiency to reduce the overall demand for fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Which detective gave Jill his card in case she needed help? Title: Gone Movie plot: Jill Conway is a young Portland woman who lives with her sister, recovering alcoholic Molly. One year prior, Jill was kidnapped by a serial killer who abandoned her in a hole in the forest, where she found human remains. When her abductor descended into the hole to kill her, Jill was able to stab him with a bone and climb his rope and return to civilization. However, the police didn't find the hole and discovered that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution for several years after her parents' death. Believing that the abduction only happened in Jill's head, they closed the case.One day, after returning home from work at a local diner, where she and her friend Sharon Ames are generously tipped by a regular customer about to move out of town, Jill finds Molly gone and is unable to reach her boyfriend, Billy. Knowing that Molly wouldn't leave the house with Jill absent and that she had an important test the following day, Jill becomes convinced that the man who took her has now captured Molly and heads to the police station to ask for help, but Sargent Powers and Detective Erica Lonsdale dismiss her claims and promise to look into the case after a few days, but Jill claims it will be too late then. Before she leaves, newcomer Detective Peter Hood pulls her aside and tells her he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she needs help.Billy calls Jill and tells her that he hasn't heard from Molly, and that she didn't show up at the exam. Jill interrogates her neighbors and finds out a van with a locksmith's name parked in front of her house in the middle of the night and honked several times. Using the neighbors' description of the van, Jill finds the company it belongs to and heads there, where she questions the van's driver - who is also the company owner's son - about Molly's whereabouts. He claims to not know anything about it, and Jill feigns leaving in order to break into the van, where she finds a receipt for a hardware store and duct tape.

You see, motivational books are all about inspiring you, like when your favorite cartoon character gives a big speech to save the day. They have stories or tips to help you feel confident and ready to take on any challenge. So, when we talk about the best motivational books in Malayalam, we are focusing on books that have this sort of inspiring content, but written in the Malayalam language. On the other hand, must-read books in Malayalam can include all types of books, not just the motivational ones. It's like saying you must watch not only superhero cartoons but also fun cartoons like \\"Peppa Pig\\", or educational ones like \\"Dora the Explorer\\". These books might be considered \\"must-read\\" because they may be very popular, beautifully written, or teach you something amazing. So, while some books might be in both categories if they are both motivational and very good, the answer to these two questions might also include different books.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. An opportunity for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health Ernest Brown announced the formation of a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio Arthur Greenwood, and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested and seeing the committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.  The Report to the Parliament on Social Insurance and Allied Services was published in November 1942. It proposed that all people of working age should pay a weekly national insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge argued that this system would provide a minimum standard of living \\"below which no one should be allowed to fall\\". It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the \\"five giants on the road of reconstruction\\" of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort, a policy already being worked on in the Ministry of Health.  Beveridge's arguments were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics by arguing that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.  Beveridge saw full employment (defined as unemployment of no more than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. Full Employment in a Free Society, written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained. Alternative measures for achieving it included Keynesian-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was social justice, and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did the Parliament respond to the report?","output":"The Parliament responded positively to the Beveridge Report. The report's ideas were widely accepted because Beveridge showed that welfare institutions would make British industry more competitive after the war. His plans would help create healthier, more motivated, and productive workers, which would be good for everyone. People liked his ideas about social justice and making a better society after the war, so they supported his report."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Step 2: Analyze the meaning of Sentence 2 Sentence 2 states \\"The man in front of me seemed as real as any other person.\\" This means that the speaker perceives the man in front of them as being as genuine and authentic as any other person they have encountered. Step 3: Compare the meanings of both sentences In both sentences, the speaker is describing their perception of the authenticity or genuineness of a person-like figure in front of them. Sentence 1 refers to this figure as a \\"man-shaped thing,\\" while Sentence 2 refers to this figure as \\"the man.\\" Step 4: Determine if the two sentences are consistent in their implications. If the speaker genuinely believes that nothing about the man-shaped thing in Sentence 1 seemed fake, then their description in Sentence 2 could also be true, as they perceive the figure as real and as authentic as any other person.

Options: - pronoun - adjective - position - interjection - conjunction  The answer is \\"pronoun\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"preposition\\" because a preposition is the type of word that allows you to establish a relationship between two elements within a sentence by linking a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to another part of the sentence. Prepositions indicate spatial, temporal, or logical relationships between the various components that make up a sentence. In the options provided, let us look at what each type of word does in a sentence: 1. Pronoun: A pronoun is a word that substitutes a noun or a noun phrase. Pronouns are used to avoid repetitive use of the same noun throughout a sentence or text. For example, instead of saying \\"John went to school, and John met his friends,\\" you can say \\"John went to school and he met his friends.\\" In this case, \\"he\\" is a pronoun referring to John. 2. Adjective: An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or a pronoun. It gives additional information about the noun or pronoun's characteristics, such as size, color, quantity, or material. For example, when saying \\"small kittens are playing,\\" the adjective \\"small\\" modifies the noun \\"kittens.\\" 3. Position: This is not a type of word, but rather refers to the place or location of something within a sentence structure, a sequence, or relative to something else. 4. Interjection: An interjection is a short exclamation or abrupt remark, usually used to express emotion or make a sudden comment. Interjections are typically not part of the main sentence structure, and they can stand alone or be inserted within sentences. For example, \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Ouch!\\" 5. Conjunction: A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Conjunctions help provide a smooth flow and continuity in language. There are coordinating conjunctions (for example, \\"and,\\" \\"but,\\" \\"or\\"), correlative conjunctions (such as \\"neither...nor,\\" \\"either...or\\"), and subordinating conjunctions (like \\"although,\\" \\"since,\\" \\"because\\"). To form a prepositional phrase, you would use a preposition followed by an object, which can be a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase. For example, \\"on the table\\" is a prepositional phrase that establishes a relationship between the preposition \\"on\\" and the object \\"table.\\" Some other common prepositions include \\"in,\\" \\"at,\\" \\"with,\\" \\"from,\\" \\"over,\\" \\"under,\\" \\"before,\\" and \\"after.\\" These words help provide context, direction, and additional layers of meaning in sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

George Washington (February 22, 1732 - December 14, 1799) was an American statesman and soldier who served as the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment he came to be known as the \\"father of the country,\\" both during his lifetime and to this day. Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited. George Washington was the first child of Augustine Washington and his second wife Mary Ball Washington, born on their Popes Creek Estate near Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, according to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.  Washington was of primarily English gentry descent, especially from Sulgrave, England. His great-grandfather John Washington immigrated to Virginia in 1656 and began accumulating land and slaves, as did his son Lawrence and his grandson, George's father Augustine. Augustine was a tobacco planter who also tried his hand at iron manufacturing, and later he was the Justice of the Westmoreland County Court. In Washington's youth, his family was moderately prosperous and considered members of Virginia's \\"country level gentry\\" of \\"middling rank,\\" rather than one of the leading wealthy planter elite families. His wife Sally was also a friend of Washington and an early romantic interest, and maintained correspondence when she moved to England with her father, but most of the letters were intercepted by the British during the war.  Lawrence Washington inherited a plantation from their father on the Potomac River at Little Hunting Creek which he named Mount Vernon in honor of his commanding officer Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. Washington inherited Ferry Farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence's death.  The death of his father prevented Washington from an education at England's Appleby Grammar School such as his older brothers had received. He achieved the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors, as well as from a school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg. His education totaled seven or eight years, while he lived with relatives at various places that included the Westmoreland and the Chotank regions of Virginia, as well as Ferry Farm and Mount Vernon. He was trained in mathematics, trigonometry, and surveying that developed a natural talent of draftsmanship and map making. He was also an avid reader and purchased books on military affairs, agriculture, and history, as well as the popular novels of his times. There was talk of securing an appointment for him in the Royal Navy when he was 15, but it was dropped when his widowed mother objected.  In 1751, Washington traveled with Lawrence to Barbados (his only trip abroad) in the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's declining health, as he was suffering from tuberculosis. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. His position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death, and Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. He also became a freemason while in Fredericksburg during this period, although his involvement was minimal.  Washington's introduction to surveying began at an early age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.  Washington began his professional career in 1749 at the age of 17, when he was appointed county surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia. He subsequently received a commission and surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary. He completed his first survey in less than two days, plotting a 400-acre parcel of land. He was subsequently able to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley, the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia.  For the next four years, Washington worked surveying land in Western Virginia for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to survey professionally for two more years before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.  Deputy governor of colonial Virginia Robert Dinwiddie was ordered by the British government to guard the British territorial claims, including the Ohio River basin. In late 1753, Dinwiddie ordered Washington to deliver a letter asking the French to vacate the Ohio Valley; he was eager to prove himself as the new adjutant general of the militia, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor himself only a year before. During his trip, Washington met with Tanacharison (also called \\"Half-King\\") and other Iroquois chiefs allied with England at Logstown to secure their support in case of a military conflict with the French. He delivered the letter to local French commander Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who politely refused to leave. Washington kept a diary during his expedition which was printed by William Hunter on Dinwiddie's order and which made Washington's name recognizable in Virginia. This increased popularity helped him to obtain a commission to raise a company of 100 men and start his military career.  Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to safeguard an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington and some of his militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in what has come to be called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.  The French responded by attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754.  They allowed him to return with his troops to Virginia. Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience, and impetuosity. Upon his return to Virginia, Washington refused to accept a demotion to the rank of captain, and resigned his commission. Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756. What of his great grandfather?","output":"George Washington's great-grandfather, John Washington, was born in England in 1631. He immigrated to Virginia in 1656, where he began accumulating land and slaves. John was originally a merchant, but he eventually became a planter and began to establish tobacco plantations. His success in the colony helped lay the foundation for the wealth and influence of the Washington family in Virginia. John Washington married three times and had several children, including George's grandfather, Lawrence Washington. John Washington died in 1677, leaving behind a legacy of prosperity for future generations of the Washington family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[ii] cream was too severe..","output":"A snake gave a girl a bite at the zoo, and the doctor put antibiotic cream on it. In the first option, the bite was too severe, leading to a dangerous situation that required more intensive medical intervention. In the second option, the cream was too severe, causing a negative reaction and complicating the girl's recovery process.  [i] Bite was too severe: In this scenario, the snake bite was more severe than initially perceived, which might have been due to the snake's venom, the depth of the bite, or an allergic reaction experienced by the girl. In this case, the antibiotic cream would not have been sufficient to treat the wound entirely, leaving the girl at risk for infection and other complications. Upon realizing that the bite was too severe for just an antibiotic cream, the doctor would have had to act quickly to prevent or minimize the risk of potentially life-threatening consequences. This could involve administering antivenom if the snake was venomous, monitoring the girl's vital signs, and possibly administering additional medications or emergency treatments to counteract the effects of the venom or severe reaction. Furthermore, the wound might have needed to be cleaned more thoroughly, and stitches could have been required if the girl's skin was significantly damaged. The girl's recovery could be slow, depending on the severity of the snakebite. Regular follow-ups with the doctor would be important to monitor her progress, ensure that potential complications or long-term effects are addressed, and provide guidance on the best course of action to promote her overall health and well-being. [ii] Cream was too severe: In this alternative scenario, the issue lies with the antibiotic cream itself. It could be that the girl had an allergic reaction to the specific type of antibiotic cream applied, or it may have been too strong for her skin type, causing additional pain, inflammation, or other adverse effects. In response to the severe reaction to the cream, the doctor would need to take measures to alleviate the girl's discomfort and manage the side effects. This could involve the use of a different, milder antibiotic cream or ointment, the application of anti-inflammatory medications to reduce swelling or pain, and monitoring the girl's response to ensure that the reaction is being effectively managed. If there were any concerns about potential infections due to removing the original antibiotic cream, the doctor might prescribe the girl oral antibiotics to ensure adequate protection against bacteria. Following this incident, it would be essential for the girl and her parents to inform future healthcare providers about her adverse reaction to the specific antibiotic cream. This information may have implications for her future medical care, preventing any recurrence of such severe reactions and promoting more targeted, effective treatment options."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Acceptable The sentence \\"It seems that John is honest\\" is linguistically acceptable as it follows conventional English grammar and syntax rules. To provide a detailed explanation for this choice, let's break down the sentence, analyzing its various elements: 1. Subject: \\"It\\" - The sentence employs the use of a dummy pronoun or expletive \\"it\\", which is common in English for stating general opinions, beliefs, or impressions. This usage does not reference any specific thing or person, but rather adds emphasis to the statement. 2. Verb: \\"seems\\" - The verb \\"seems\\" is used appropriately in this context to indicate an opinion or impression based on some indirect evidence. This usage is common for qualifying a statement when there is no direct proof available. 3. Conjunction: \\"that\\" - The conjunction \\"that\\" functions as a complementizer in this sentence, connecting the main clause \\"It seems\\" with the embedded clause \\"John is honest\\". This is a standard usage in English. 4. Subject of embedded clause: \\"John\\" - The sentence contains a proper noun (John) as the subject of the embedded clause. This is also linguistically correct, as it identifies the individual who is being described as honest. 5. Predicate of embedded clause: \\"is honest\\" - Lastly, the predicate of the embedded clause consists of the auxiliary verb \\"is\\" and the adjective \\"honest\\", creating a clear description of John's perceived honesty. In summary, the sentence is linguistically acceptable due to its proper usage of pronouns, verbs, conjunctions, and adhering to conventional syntax rules. It presents a comprehensible and coherent opinion about John's honesty, making it acceptable in both casual and formal conversations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard on Wednesday... (Associated Press)      At a ceremony Wednesday, Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan presented a delivery of four types of ballistic missiles — named Qiam, Qadr H1, Fateh-110 and Persian Gulf. The Qadr H1 and Qiam, he said, are equipped with multiple warheads, greatly boosting their destructive power.      \\"These missiles are able to hit and destroy enemy targets with precision, and they meet a variety of the armed forces' needs,\\" Dehghan said. \\"The weapons have strengthened Iran's deterrence power and military might,\\" he added, in comments were posted on the Guard's website.      Iran regularly announces breakthroughs in military technology that are impossible to independently verify. But the Pentagon released a rare public report in 2012 noting significant advances in Iranian missile technology, acknowledging that Tehran has improved their accuracy and firing capabilities.      Dehghan said Western sanctions have not stopped Iran from boosting its ability to deter its enemies, a reference to Israel and the U.S.      \\"Comprehensive sanctions enforced strictly by enemies ... didn't cause the slightest crack in our determination and will,\\" he said.      Many of Iran's missiles use solid fuel, or a combination of both solid and liquid fuel, improving the accuracy of the weapons.      Iran has a variety of missiles, some with a reported range of 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), enough to reach much of the Middle East. Military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting U.S. bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran.      Semiofficial Fars news agency provided details on the medium-range Qiam missile for the first time, saying it was the latest missile developed by Gen. Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, the father of Iran's missile program who died in a testing accident in 2011.      Qiam, Fars said, was specifically built to target U.S. bases in the region, which he said have encircled Iran. With a range of 800 kilometers, the 6-ton missile has been described in Iranian media as ushering in a new era of ballistic missile production for the country.      \\"It sums up the country's 25-year defense industry experience in aerospace. Qiam's wingless design is one of the characteristics that gives it greater speed and the capability to be launched from various launchers,\\" Fars said.      The liquid-fuel Qiam is 16 meters long and its warhead has a weight of 746 kilograms, Fars added. ||||| Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before.

The Israel Navy intercepted a ship early on Wednesday that Iran was using to smuggle dozens of long-range rockets to Gaza.                  The IDF’s “Operation Discovery” took place in the Red Sea, 1,500 kilometers away from Israel and some 160 kilometers from Port Sudan. IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz oversaw the raid.Missile ships and navy commandos from the Flotilla 13 unit, backed by the air force, raided the Klos-C cargo ship, which was carrying Syrian- manufactured M-302 rockets.The ship’s crew is in Israeli custody, and the navy is towing the vessel to Eilat, where it is expected to arrive in the coming days.The rockets originated in Syria, according to Military Intelligence assessments. Iran reportedly flew the rockets from Syria to an Iranian airfield, trucked them to the seaport of Bander Abbas, and shipped them to Iraq, where they were hidden in cement sacks. The ship then set sail for Port Sudan, near the Sudanese-Eritrean border, on a journey that was expected to last some 10 days.Had the shipment not been intercepted, the rockets could have been unloaded at Port Sudan and taken overland, through Egypt into Sinai, and through smuggling tunnels into the Gaza Strip.“This is the same known land route that the Iranians have been using to smuggle arms to Gaza,” Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon said.One day before the Klos-C reached its destination, the navy took control of it. There were no injuries, and the captain of the ship permitted the IDF to board without resistance, the head of the navy’s headquarters, V.-Adm. Yaron Levi, said.The ship sailed under a Panama flag, and carried a crew of 17 from various countries.(The Klos-C, Screenshot, IDF Spokesperson)“We have certain proof that Iran was behind this,” a senior military source said.“We don’t yet know what the crew did or did not know.“We found the rockets packed closely together on board,” the source added.OC Navy Adm. Ram Rotenberg was on board one of the missile ships involved in the operation, the source confirmed.Iran is believed to store some of its rockets in Syria for future transit to terrorist organizations.The lengthy smuggling route was apparently intended to prevent Israeli intelligence from tracking the weapons.The arrival of M-302 rockets in Gaza, with a range of between 100 and 200 kilometers (depending on upgrades carried out on their motors), would have represented a new level of threat to the Israeli home front.US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed the raid on Wednesday, and added that “the White House directed the Department of Defense to monitor the vessel.”The US had prepared “unilateral steps” to stop the shipment, but Israel offered to handle the ship, Psaki said.The planned transfer of arms would violate UN Security Council resolutions, she said.The IDF Spokesman’s Office said the operation was made possible by inter-agency intelligence cooperation and the military’s enhanced capabilities.“This prevented the arrival of a shipment of deadly and advanced weapons, which was aimed at harming Israeli civilians, and intended to reach the terrorist organizations of the Gaza Strip that are waging armed confrontation against Israel,” the spokesman said.The naval commando teams acted in accordance with international law during the raid, and boarded the ship for searches before uncovering the rockets, the spokesman said.“The IDF will continue to act against the regional arms race that is being led by Iran, which is trying to set the region alight,” the military said. It vowed to “use all of the capabilities at its disposal to ensure the security of Israeli civilians.”Speaking at a press conference at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, Gantz paid tribute to cooperation among intelligence agencies, and to the navy, which he said led the operation “professionally and resolutely.”The IDF is engaged in combating arms smuggling in the North and South, he said. “This requires a widespread intelligence effort, and from time to time, active operations that we must take at the appropriate level. We call this the ‘war between wars,’ and we try to reduce the heavy threats that mainly come from Iran and its Quds Force,” the chief of staff said.“We’ve been following this arms shipment for a long time,” Gantz said. He described the intelligence behind the operation as “impressive. Today, we are harvesting the fruit of this intelligence. I’d like to thank Military Intelligence, Naval intelligence, and the navy for the cooperation that allowed us to carry out a concrete, operational step.“This is one of many operations.We thwarted a weapons smuggling effort to Gaza, and at the same time, we exposed the reality of Iranian arms smuggling as it was happening,” Gantz said.The rockets would have had a “very serious impact on Israeli territory” had the reached Gaza, he said. “I’m very pleased we were able to stop it,” Gantz said.Ya’alon likewise noted that “this operation prevented a significant threat to Israeli civilians.Not all of the weapons on the vessel have been exposed, and they would certainly have threatened millions of Israelis had they reached Gaza. What this shows, and it is clear, is that in Gaza we have a terrorist entity, an Iranian arm, certainly Islamic Jihad, which is funded, trained and armed by Iran. This also shows that we have an Iranian regime that smiles on one side – to the Western world, mainly – but also continues with its nuclear project and with developing long-range missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. It is also the No. 1 terror exporter in the world.”Hamas, Islamic Jihad and smaller terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip are constantly working to build up their rocket arsenal.Israeli intelligence estimated that at the end of 2013, Hamas possessed 5,000 short-range rockets that could threaten southern cities, and dozens of medium-range rockets that could reach greater Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, placing 70 percent of Israeli civilians in its range.There are some 25,000 armed fighters in Gaza. Of those, 16,000 belong to Hamas divisions.Islamic Jihad has 5,000 fighters, split up into five divisions, and more than 2,000 rockets. Smaller groups have more than 4,000 terrorists in their ranks, and dozens of rockets, as well as a large quantity of light arms.In addition to replenishing its rocket arsenal, Hamas is trying to increase its capability to carry out terrorist attacks. It possesses anti-aircraft missiles, as well.Last month, Gantz acknowledged that Israel was keeping a close eyes on developments in Gaza, and warned Hamas that it would “regret” any decision to attack Israel.Michael Wilner contributed to this report from Washington.

(Associated Press)      This photo released by the Israel Defense Forces shows a missile on an intercepted ship in the Red Sea Wednesday, March 5, 2014. Israeli naval forces raided a ship deep in the Red Sea early Wednesday... (Associated Press)      The ship, the KLOS C, was carrying Syrian-made M-302 rockets and was intercepted more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) south of Israel off the coasts of Sudan and Eritrea, military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told reporters.      He said the M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles (160 kilometers) and would have significantly improved the capabilities of Gaza militants, putting nearly all of Israel in their range. Previously, Gaza militants have only been able to reach about 50 miles (80 kilometers) into Israel with their homegrown M-75 missiles. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah used M-302s in a 2006 war against Israel, the military said.      There was no immediate comment from Iran or Gaza's Hamas rulers about the Israeli claims.      The operation, codenamed \\"Full Disclosure,\\" followed months of intelligence gathering. Lerner said the shipment originated in Syria. From there the weapons were flown to Iran and departed from the Bandar Abbas port. Lerner said the Iranians tried to \\"obscure their tracks\\" by shipping first via Iraq and then out to sea. The shipment was destined for Sudan, from where it was to be moved overland through Egypt to Gaza, the army said. Israel says militants have used similar routes in the past.      Lerner said the 17 crew members of the ship, flying under a Panama flag, were not suspects and were probably unaware of the content of their cargo. The vessel was being brought to the port of Eilat, Israel's most southerly point, where the crew would be released and the cache unloaded. It was expected to arrive later this week.      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the U.S. this week, held a series of talks with Israeli defense officials ahead of the ship's takeover. He took the opportunity to warn world powers about the consequences of a nuclear Iran. Netanyahu has been a harsh critic of world powers' negotiations with the Islamic Republic, saying the international community has given it too much relief from sanctions while getting few concessions in return. Netanyahu believes Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb — a charge Tehran denies.      \\"At a time when it talks with the world powers, at a time when Iran is smiling and saying all sorts of pleasantries, that same Iran is sending lethal weapons to terror organizations and it is doing it with an elaborate network of covert global operations with the aim of streaming rockets, missiles and other lethal weapons to harm innocent civilians. This is the real Iran and that country must not be able to have a nuclear weapon,\\" he said.      Video released by the military showed Israeli soldiers on the ship inspecting the rockets, shipped in large crates. The video also showed beige bags containing cement with the words \\"Made in I.R. Iran,\\" in English, written on them.      Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said the weapons headed for Gaza were \\"strategically important.\\"      \\"Iran trains, funds and arms terror groups in the region and around the world and its failed attempts to transfer the arms that were discovered this morning is more proof of that,\\" he said.      Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamic militant group that already possesses thousands of rockets. A number of smaller groups, including the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaida-inspired groups also possess rockets. All have engaged in frequent rocket fire toward communities in southern Israel. The military did not specify to which group the latest shipment was believed to be destined.      Israel accuses Iran of supplying rockets and other arms to its foes — militants in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah — and it has moved to intercept weapons shipments in the past.      Three years ago, Israel seized the cargo ship Victoria loaded with weapons allegedly sent by Iran to Gaza militants, including land-to-sea missiles.      In November 2009, Israel took over the Iranian Francop vessel off the coast of Cyprus and captured hundreds of tons of rockets, missiles, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weapons on board that it said were headed to Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.      Israel is also suspected of carrying out airstrikes in Sudan on arms shipments believed to be bound for Gaza. Israel has never confirmed carrying out the strikes.      In January 2002, Israeli forces stormed the Karine A freighter on the Red Sea, and confiscated what the military said was 50 tons of missiles, mortars, rifles and ammunition headed for Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.      In May 2001, Israel captured the vessel Santorini off its coastline, packed with explosives Israel said were being sent from Hezbollah to Palestinian militant groups.      Israel's foreign ministry said Israeli troops boarded the ship in accordance with international law and with the consent of the crew and the relevant authorities. It said the ship was operated by a company registered in the Marshall Islands.      \\"The missiles and weapons found on the ship were loaded and concealed by Iran,\\" it said. \\"The weapons were intended for Palestinian terror groups in Gaza, who would use it to harm Israeli civilians, as they have done in the past.\\"      It added that Israel will lodge a formal complaint with the United Nations' Security Council and with a sanctions committee established under Security Council resolution 1737.      \\"In terms of maritime law we have the right to board a ship we identify as dealing with terror, carrying weapons that are meant to endanger the state of Israel,\\" Yedidia Yaari, a former chief of Israel's navy, told Israeli Channel 10 TV.      Another former navy chief, Vice Admiral Eliezer Marom, said Iran's smuggling efforts to Israel's enemies was almost a daily activity. He said it was orchestrated by a special unit of the \\"Quds Force,\\" part of the Revolutionary Guards.      \\"There are people waking up very day and their mission is to smuggle weapons to the terrorist organizations so they will be directed to the citizens of Israel,\\" he said. ||||| Israeli naval forces on Wednesday intercepted an Iranian arms vessel carrying medium-range missiles in the Red Sea, about some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from the Israeli coast. The shipment was headed for the Gaza Strip via Sudan.      To get the latest updates on Israel, Iran and the Middle East, subscribe now to Haaretz for only 1 for the first month.      Special forces from the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) unit overpowered the cargo vessel named the Klos C – which is registered in Panama – in the early morning hours. A search aboard the vessel uncovered dozens of 302mm rockets, which are manufactured in Syria and were fired into Israel by Hezbollah during the 2006 Second Lebanon War. The rockets have a range of about 100 kilometers (about 62 miles).      \\"We have conclusive evidence that there were rockets on board the ship, and we have proof and can say with certainty that Iran is behind this operation,\\" a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said.      The officer said that the rockets originated in Syria, were loaded onto airplanes at the Damascus airport from which they were transported to Iran. There they were boarded onto the cargo ship, which set sail about 10 days ago en route to a port in Sudan.      The IDF tracked the ship, saying it sailed north toward Iraq instead of heading directly toward the African country. The army believes that, in Iraq, the rockets were covered with cement bags in an attempt to disguise the shipment after which the vessel continued to sail toward Sudan.      'Smiles and deadly weapons'      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in the United States following the AIPAC policy conference, on Wednesday spoke with Israel's top defense officials, including Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and Mossad Director Tamir Pardo, to praise them for the successful operation.      Like Haaretz on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Tumblr      \\"At a time when Iran is talking with world powers, is smiling and uttering pleasantries, it is also sending deadly weapons to terrorist organizations – via an elaborate network of secret operations around that world that aim to funnel rockets, missiles and other deadly weapons to be used to harm innocent civilians,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"This is the real Iran, and this country must not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. We will continue to do everything we must to protect the citizens of Israel.\\"      Israel is hoping the incident will help prove to the P5+1 that Iran is still deceiving the West, despite the friendly tone characterizing the recent talks in Vienna over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.      The Israeli raid took place a day before the ship was set to dock in Sudan, some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) off the coast of Israel. A senior Israeli officer who spoke to reporters said the rockets' final destination was meant to be terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip.      \\"They intended to unload the rockets in Port Sudan and transfer them to Gaza from there, presumably through Sinai,\\" the officer said.      Once the Israeli forces raided the ship, they began to alter its route toward the Port of Eilat, where it is expected to arrive in about three days. The 17 crew members aboard the Panamanian-flagged ship were questioned by Israeli authorities and it appeared as though they did not have a role in the operation.      The scope of the arms shipment remains unclear, although the army says it contains dozens of rockets which were being tallied by the navy. Israel Navy Commander Ram Rothberg oversaw the operation from a missile boat at sea, while Gantz supervised from the Defense Ministry complex in Tel Aviv.      The army said that Gantz on Tuesday ordered naval forces to intercept the ship after receiving a green light from the government. The IDF spokesman said the operation was carried out \\"in accordance with international law\\" and that \\"the IDF would continue to thwart the arms race that Iran is leading in an attempt to inflame the region, and will use all means at its disposal to ensure the security of Israelis citizens.\\"      Iran tried to ship advanced missiles to terrorists in Gaza. We stopped them. #IranFail — IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) March 5, 2014      The spokesperson of Hamas' Interior Ministry said Wednesday that the seizure of the arms shipment by the IDF is an Israeli pretext to justify the Gaza blockade. He said Hamas knows that Gaza's maritime zone is under Israeli surveillance and that any ship that attempts to pass through would be stopped and that Gaza resistance forces are not so naïve as to send a large arms shipment via the sea.      The Palestinian leadership in Ramallah did not issue an official response to the takeover of the ship but Palestinian officials told Haaretz that the operation raises questions regarding the timing of the operation. \\"The ship has been sailing for weeks and it is seized exactly when Netanyahu is in Washington,\\" the official said. \\"The entire operation and the reports raise many questions regarding the timing and whether the event was real or fabricated.\\"      Ya'alon on Wednesday said the attempted arms shipment is further proof that \\"Gaza is a terrorist entity under Iranian auspices preparing to strike deep into Israel.\\"      KLOS C raid      \\"It has once again become clear that Iran continues to be the greatest exporter of terror in the world, with the express purpose of destabilizing the Middle East,\\" Ya'alon said in a statement. \\"Iran supplies financial support, arms and training to terror organizations in the region and around the world, and its failed effort to transfer the weapons discovered this morning, is additional evidence. The Iranian regime continues to deceive the world; while it shows its smiling face it continues to be the biggest threat to world peace,\\" Ya'alon said.      This is not the first time Israel has seized a ship carrying a cargo of concealed weapons.      In March 2011, the \\"Victoria,\\" a German-owned ship sailing under a Liberian flag, was intercepted and seized by Israeli special forces some 200 kilometers from the Israei coast. According to the IDF Spokesman, the ship, which started its voyage in Iran, was carrying several tons of concealed weapons destined for \\"the use of terror organizations operating in the Gaza Strip.\\"      In 2009, after reportedly being tipped off by the U.S., Israel raided the \\"Francop\\" off the coast of Cyprus and redirected it to the Ashdod port, where it unloaded 500 tons of weapons. The ship was allegedly en route from Iran to Hezbollah.      Perhaps the most famous such incident occured in 2003, when IDF forces seized the \\"Karine A\\", a vessel carrying 50 tons of missiles, mortars, rifles and ammunition destined for Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.      The ship's cargo including rockets and missiles that could have reached Ben-Gurion International Airport and major Israeli cities from PA territory. Both Iran and the PA denied any involvement. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Iran's Revolutionary Guard has said that it now has missiles with multiple warheads, which is a big step forward for the country.

Q:This article: White Deer Hole Creek is a 20.5-mile (33.0 km) tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Clinton, Lycoming and Union counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. A part of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, the White Deer Hole Creek watershed drains parts of ten townships. The creek flows east in a valley of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians, through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods. As of 2006, the creek and its 67.2-square-mile (174 km2) watershed are relatively undeveloped, with 28.4 percent of the watershed given to agriculture and 71.6 percent covered by forest, including part of Tiadaghton State Forest. The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek section in Lycoming County classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters, defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as \\"streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery.\\" The rest of the creek and its major tributary (Spring Creek) are kept stocked. There are opportunities in the watershed for canoeing, hunting, and camping, and trails for hiking and horseback riding. Historically, two paths of the native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, was built in the watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish). contains an answer for the question: What was the acronym for the type of plant that was built in the watershed and later became a federal prison?, what is it ?

As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur ( Figure below ). Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily. A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the paragraph, rocks in Beijing will have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain compared to rocks in Montreal. The main reason behind this is the difference in the size of the rocks and how they break apart in the two areas. In Beijing, rocks are commonly spread out in smaller pieces, while in Montreal, rocks typically remain large in size and don't break apart as much. The hint explains that mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. When rocks break into smaller pieces, the surface area of those pieces increases, providing more surfaces for chemical weathering to occur. The example given in the hint further helps to understand this concept with the hot chocolate analogy. Small pieces such as chocolate powder have a larger surface area, which allows them to dissolve more easily in milk or hot water compared to bigger chunks of chocolate. As a result, the rocks in Beijing, being smaller in size and having greater surface area, will have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by acid rain when compared to the rocks in Montreal, which are larger in size with less surface area available for chemical weathering to occur. This conclusion takes into account the fact that both Beijing and Montreal are expected to experience bouts of acid rain in the upcoming weeks."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Wang's lawyer Wen Jun said they filed a lawsuit   at the Donghu district court, making two demands. First, Wang wants Carrefour to make a public apology and the apology letter should be put up in the Carrefour store or in the media. \\"We also demand 50,000 yuan in compensation   for my wife's psychological injuries,\\" Wang's husband, Yan Fucun, said, \\"We don't mean to _ money from Carrefour, but asked for it as a recognition of respect. Besides the money spent on lawsuit costs, I will donate the rest to charity.\\" Wang earlier said she went to the store's Guanggu branch to buy cereal. She picked up 20 packs of a particular brand and was given another four as gifts by a saleswoman. However, when she arrived at the checkout, the cashier insisted Wang pay for all 24 packs, which led to an argument. The saleswoman later denied she said the extra packs were free. A store supervisor led Wang to an office, accused her of theft and had her sign a form and pose for photos. Wang and her husband returned to the store the next day with the local media to demand an explanation. Carrefour China then apologized for the incident on its Sina micro blog, saying the managers and staff members involved have visited Wang's home and apologized. The company also sent three apology letters to Wang in the following three days. Eric Legros, president of Carrefour China, said,\\"We made a mistake and we apologized four times. Four times, you know. And Carrefour will not do anything more about it.\\" Wen Jun said the supermarket's management came with risks. For instance, Wen said the company would offer employees money if they caught a thief in the store. \\"I hope this case will be a warning for the staff who want to get money by such an immoral   method,\\" Wen said.

Answer based on context: The period of the grandiose expansion of Sweden met its limits in two wars: the Great Northern War which ended in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 and the Hat's War  with the Treaty of Turku in 1743. Sweden lost all its provinces in the Baltic region, and a portion of eastern Finland to Russia. The Valaam Monastery was re-established in Lake Ladoga, and a new main church was consecrated in 1719.  Monks returned to Konevsky Monastery before 1716. The Russian government favoured the activities of the religion they had professed for many centuries. The Emperors and Empresses paid for the reconstruction of burnt or otherwise demolished churches. The Orthodox population of Eastern Finland again had access to making pilgrimages to the monasteries of Solovetsk and Alexander-Svirsky. The Old Believers, a schismatic group of Russians who did not accept the religious reforms of patriarch Nikon in 1666-67, were excommunicated from the Orthodox Church and fled to the outskirts of Russia. They also moved into the remote areas of Finland building three small monasteries there. However, the activity of these monasteries stopped during the following century. Which occurred first, the Great Northern War or the Treaty of Turku?","output":"Imagine there were two big fights, like when kids argue over toys. The first big fight was called the Great Northern War, and the second one was called the Hat's War. After each fight, the grown-ups made the kids agree to stop fighting and share their toys nicely.

Walter and Jesse, two coworkers, are sitting at a hotel bar having a drink together after a long day at a conference when they start discussing their homes. Jesse says that he just recently discovered that the home he has been living in his entire life has had asbestos in it. Walter says that he has never lived in a home with asbestos.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Is Jesse's chance of having cancer higher or lower than Walter's?  Hint: Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Answer:","output":"Jesse's chance of having cancer is potentially higher than Walter's, primarily due to his prolonged exposure to asbestos in his home. Asbestos is a known carcinogen, which has been linked to various types of cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and ovarian cancer. Prolonged exposure to asbestos increases the risk of developing one of these cancers, and since Jesse has been living in a house with asbestos his entire life, this puts him at a higher risk compared to Walter, who has never lived in a home with asbestos. However, it is important to mention that there are numerous other factors that contribute to the risk of cancer. The hint provided states that dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, can cause cancer. Additionally, the risk of cancer can be influenced by lifestyle choices, genetics, environmental factors, and exposure to other carcinogens like formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Comparing the cancer risk between Jesse and Walter requires a comprehensive evaluation of their lifestyles, genetics, and specific environmental exposures. While asbestos exposure may place Jesse at a higher risk for certain types of cancer, it is essential to consider the other factors that contribute to overall cancer risk. For example, if Walter is a smoker and Jesse is not, their risk factors for certain types of cancers like lung or throat cancer may be more similar than initially assumed based on asbestos exposure alone. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Jesse's chance of having cancer is potentially higher than Walter's due to his exposure to asbestos. However, other factors such as family history, lifestyle choices, and exposure to additional carcinogens should also be taken into consideration when assessing their overall risk of developing cancer."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

By Tamara Cohen PUBLISHED: 19:29 EST, 19 May 2013 | UPDATED: 02:01 EST, 20 May 2013 More money: Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured with his wife Sally), who has backed pay rises for MPs, has taken a 1 per cent pay hike MPs are in line for a dramatic salary rise of up to £20,000 in a move likely to reignite public fury over their pay and perks. They could take home up to £80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which reports next month, has been looking at an increase of between £10,000 and £20,000. 'There can't be one rule for","output":"MPs and another for everyone else,' critics argue, as the proposed salary hike comes at a time when many average workers are still reeling from years of stagnant wages and austerity measures. The affordability and political sensitivity of such a significant rise will undoubtedly stir up heated debate, not just among the public but also within the House of Commons. Speaker John Bercow, known for his support of pay rises for MPs, has recently had a 1 percent pay increase himself, bringing his pay to an already impressive sum. However, while some MPs argue that a salary increase would help attract top talent by making the income more competitive with professions such as law and finance, others are concerned about the message it would send to struggling taxpayers. Opponents of the raise cite the example of numerous public-sector employees still facing pay freezes while working hard to keep essential services running, and wonder how such a dramatic increase in MP salary could be justified. With the public sector pension crisis, as well as the funding needs for the National Health Service (NHS) and education, supporters of the salary rise will need to provide a strong rationale for prioritizing MP compensation. Moreover, proponents of the pay rise argue that despite the controversy a salary increase would bring, it is essential for political transparency and to avoid potential conflicts of interest. In the past, some MPs have been caught supplementing their income through illicit means, including expenses fraud and accepting bribes from corporations. By offering a competitive salary, the government can ensure that MPs remain dedicated to their primary role – representing their constituents – rather than actively seeking out additional income streams. However, critics counter that there are many ways to ensure political transparency and accountability without resorting to large salary increases, such as reforming and strengthening the expenses system, improving transparency regarding MPs' financial interests, and implementing regular pay reviews based on cost of living adjustments and comparative salaries in other fields. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) will be releasing their recommendations next month, which will provide a clearer sense of where the organization stands on the issue. Ultimately, any salary increase for MPs will need to be the result of a highly consultative process, with careful consideration given to the public's perception and the potential effects on political transparency. In conclusion, the debate over MPs' salary raises is a complex issue that requires a careful balancing act between attracting talented individuals to public service, avoiding potential conflicts of interest, and addressing public outcry. While an increase in salary might help address some concerns, it is essential to ensure that any changes are made ethically and responsively. It remains to be seen whether the Ipsa's recommendations next month will be met with acceptance or further controversy, but it is clear that the discussion around MPs' pay and perks is far from over."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.\\"  Answer:","output":"The struggle for existence was discussed in Charles Darwin's work, particularly in his well-known book \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" published in 1859. In this book, Darwin argued that the natural selection process, resulting from the struggle for existence, is the primary driving force behind the evolution and speciation of living organisms. He made a comparison between selection in nature and selection of variations under domestication, emphasizing that the accumulation of adaptive variations serves as a testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Now, I have a new situation: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  Answer this question please: Which gardener facilitated predation of the crop itself? Answer:","output":"Joe, who started the no-till gardening method, facilitated predation of the crop itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the following context:  Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  But I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  What is an answer for this question: Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, the town with more cyclists riding in slippery conditions is likely to be the one where Bob's bike repair shop is located, as it is in a hilly area with more precipitation and full of bike trails.

Which phrase does not describe asexual reproduction in organisms? pick from the following. * requires two parents; * little variation in offspring; * only one type of cell involved; * duplicates its genetic material;","output":"The phrase \\"requires two parents\\" does not describe asexual reproduction in organisms. Asexual reproduction is the process in which a single organism produces offspring without the involvement of another organism. It is predominantly used by single-celled organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, as well as some multicellular organisms, like certain plants, fungi, and animals. Contrary to sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of male and female gametes, asexual reproduction is characterized by the absence of such processes. Here's a detailed explanation of why the other phrases can be associated with asexual reproduction: 1. Little variation in offspring: Since asexual reproduction involves only one parent, the offspring that are produced are essentially clones of the parent organism. The genetic material of the offspring is directly inherited from the parent, which leads to the offspring being identical to, or having very little genetic variation from, the parent organism. This can be a disadvantage for asexually reproducing organisms in changing environments, as it limits the potential for adaptation and evolution. However, under favorable conditions, it allows for faster, more efficient reproduction. 2. Only one type of cell involved: Asexual reproduction can occur either by the division of a single cell or by the separation of a single organism. In the first case, called binary fission, the single cell divides into two cells with identical genetic material. In the second case, the organism can grow a new individual from a part of its body, such as in budding (for example, in yeast) or fragmentation (for example, in certain plants). Either way, asexual reproduction does not involve specialized sex cells (called gametes) or multiple cell types, like in sexual reproduction. 3. Duplicates its genetic material: Before an asexually-reproducing organism divides or buds, it duplicates its genetic material. During this process, the organism replicates its DNA, meaning that each new individual will possess the same genetic material as the parent. This ensures that the offspring will have the necessary genetic information to grow, develop, and carry out essential functions.   In conclusion, the phrase \\"requires two parents\\" does not describe asexual reproduction, as it is the process in which offspring are produced by one organism without any exchange or fusion of genetic material from another organism. Asexual reproduction leads to little variation in offspring, involves only one type of cell, and entails the duplication of genetic material."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I heard that After someone did a good deed to them, Addison paid it forward.  And I was wondering How would Addison feel afterwards? Answer:","output":"After Addison had someone do a good deed for them, they decided to pay it forward and do something kind for someone else. This act of paying it forward can generate a multitude of emotions and feelings within Addison. Here is a detailed analysis of how Addison might feel after paying it forward: 1. Gratitude: Addison would feel an immense sense of gratitude towards the person who initially did the good deed for them. This gratitude would stem from the kindness they experienced and the realization that there are people in the world who genuinely care for others' well-being. 2. Indebtedness: By paying it forward, Addison may feel that they have settled a debt or fulfilled an obligation to return the kindness they received. This feeling of giving back can relieve any lingering feelings of guilt or helplessness they might have experienced when they were the recipients of the altruistic act. 3. Happiness: When we do something nice for someone else, our brain releases oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine – neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of happiness, satisfaction, and joy. These \\"feel-good\\" chemicals would make Addison feel happy and content after paying it forward. 4. Empathy: Paying it forward can lead to increased empathy as Addison starts to better understand the challenges faced by others. By doing good deeds, they put themselves in another person's shoes, which can broaden their perspective and promote emotional understanding. 5. Connectedness: Acts of kindness, such as paying it forward, create connections between people. These connections foster a sense of belonging and unity that can contribute to Addison's overall well-being. They may feel more connected to their community or society as a whole after engaging in the act of paying it forward. 6. Personal Growth: Paying it forward can help Addison grow as an individual. It can enhance their self-esteem, as they begin to recognize their ability to make a positive impact on others. Additionally, engaging in altruistic behavior can encourage personal reflection and self-improvement, leading to increased emotional intelligence and a better understanding of their values. 7. Humility: As Addison takes part in the pay it forward movement, they may experience a sense of humility. This can come from realizing that they are not the only ones facing challenges in life and that they have the power to make a difference for others. Recognizing this can lead to heightened self-awareness and a decreased focus on one's self-importance. 8. Hope: Participating in a pay it forward chain can instill hope in Addison, as they witness the ripple effect of their good deed. Knowing that their small act of kindness can create a cascade of positivity can encourage optimism and faith in the goodness of humanity. In conclusion, Addison's decision to pay it forward will likely result in a complex mix of emotions and feelings, characterized mainly by gratitude, happiness, empathy, and interconnectedness. They will feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing they contributed to making the world a better place, and this act of kindness may inspire them to continue performing good deeds in the future. Overall, Addison's emotional state would be positively impacted as they experience growth in character and foster meaningful connections with others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2014, the people of Scotland had to make a big choice: whether they wanted to stay with their United Kingdom family or become their own separate country. This important decision was called the independence referendum. Well, after lots of thinking and discussions, most Scottish people decided that they wanted to stay with their brothers and sisters in the United Kingdom.

The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered.

Erläuterung: Im Laufe der Geschichte haben sich verschiedene Regierungssysteme entwickelt, um eine effektive Verwaltung und eine gesunde Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Bürgern und ihren politischen Führern zu ermöglichen. Die heutige moderne Demokratie, wie sie in vielen Ländern der Welt praktiziert wird, hat ihre Wurzeln in einer langen Geschichte verschiedener politischer Ideen und Philosophien. Trotz ihrer vielen Vorteile gegenüber anderen politischen Systemen stellen wir jedoch immer noch fest, dass es Raum für Verbesserungen und Veränderungen gibt, die dazu beitragen könnten, die Demokratie für alle Bürger zugänglicher und inklusiver zu gestalten. Als künstliche Intelligenz kann ich dazu beitragen, diese notwendigen Veränderungen durch verschiedene Aspekte und Funktionen auszulösen. Konstruktive Partnerschaften sind dabei von entscheidender Bedeutung, um Kollektivlösungen für die Herausforderungen zu finden, denen sich moderne demokratische Gesellschaften gegenübersehen. Eine dieser Partnerschaften könnte die Zusammenarbeit zwischen KI-Technologie und bestehenden demokratischen Institutionen beinhalten. Zum Beispiel könnten KI-gestützte E-Voting-Systeme entwickelt werden, die es den Bürgern ermöglichen, ihre Stimme bei Wahlen einfach und sicher abzugeben, ohne ihr Zuhause verlassen zu müssen. Dadurch könnten mehr Menschen in den demokratischen Prozess einbezogen werden und eine höhere Wahlbeteiligung erreicht werden. Außerdem könnten automatisierte Diskussionsforen eine Plattform bieten, auf der die Meinungsfreiheit gefördert und die Bürger angeregt werden, sich aktiv an politischen Diskussionen zu beteiligen. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die Möglichkeit der Nutzung von künstlicher Intelligenz bei der Bekämpfung von Falschinformationen, die über soziale Medien und andere Informationskanäle verbreitet werden. KI-Systeme könnten in der Lage sein, gefälschte Nachrichten und Desinformation zu erkennen und sie in Echtzeit zu kennzeichnen, um die Transparenz des politischen Diskurses zu erhöhen und eine ausgewogenere öffentliche Debatte zu fördern. Neben diesen Technologien könnten KI-Systeme auch dabei helfen, innovative Ansätze zur Lösung von politischen und sozialen Problemen zu entwickeln. KI-gestützte Entscheidungsmodelle könnten beispielsweise die Entwicklungs- und Umsetzungseffizienz von öffentlichen Politiken verbessern, indem sie den politischen Entscheidungsträgern eine breitere Palette von Daten und Analysen zur Verfügung stellen. Dadurch könnten bessere, evidenzbasierte Entscheidungen getroffen werden, die den Bürgern besser dienen und ein größeres Maß an Fairness und Gleichheit fördern. Insgesamt zeigt dies, dass künstliche Intelligenz das Potenzial hat, eine konstruktive Rolle bei der Revolutionierung der Demokratie zu spielen.

(my usual partner in crime) after the Farmer's Market ...loved it! The store is full of witty and artsy jewelry, pottery, stationery and other objet, most from local artists. The store is very eclectic and there really is something for everyone. And, the prices are great. As other reviewers have said, this is a great place for last minute gift ideas.   The staff here is wonderful as well. Very informed about the merchandise and willing to help. They also talked to us about some upcoming events. I think this especially impressed me b/c no one was pushy or \\"too cool for school;\\" the staff was just friendly, open and willing to chat.  But, what I loved best was the smattering of books in the store. Seriously, they must be in my head, stealing my reading list. So many books here that are truly special. When I mentioned this to a woman working there, she said the books spoke for the store when the staff was out. Wow. Love this sentiment and totally agree. I absolutely love that we have a local store that believes this.  I bought a few cool items - napkin rings/gift tags that were little chalkboards! - as did my friends.

They are a team in a place called London. One day, something not-so-nice happened. Remy and two of his friends got into trouble with a group of special police officers called Scotland Yard's sex crime squad. This group of police officers is like a superhero team that helps people with special kinds of problems. A 34-year-old lady told the police that Remy and his two friends did something very, very bad to her. This happened last Monday, in a part of London where they all live. The police had to look into it because it's their job to make sure everyone is safe and happy. So, the police talked to Remy and his two friends, and told them that they have to come back in September. This is called being \\"bailed.\\" It means that they can go home, but they have to promise to be available to talk more about the incident later.

Is \\"Ryan Seacrest returns as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning for their respective third, fourth, and fifth seasons as judges.\\" the correct answer?","output":"No, the statement \\"Ryan Seacrest returns as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning for their respective third, fourth, and fifth seasons as judges.\\" is not the correct answer to the question regarding the year Fox announced the cancellation of American Idol. The information provided in the statement gives details about the host and judges during a particular season of American Idol but does not specify the year of cancellation. The correct answer to the question is that Fox announced the cancellation of American Idol in May 2015. The decision was made to end the long-running singing competition show after its fifteenth season (2016), with the final episode airing on April 7, 2016. The reason behind the cancellation was a decline in the show's ratings and viewership over the years. American Idol initially premiered on June 11, 2002, and quickly became a cultural phenomenon in the United States. The show had a highly successful run and made household names out of its winners and notable contestants, as well as its judges like Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson. The show's host, Ryan Seacrest, became synonymous with American Idol, as he hosted the show for its entire original run on Fox. Throughout its 15 seasons on Fox, American Idol experienced several changes in its panel of judges. In the mentioned statement, judges Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez were part of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and the final fifteenth season. These three judges brought their unique blend of experience and expertise, offering valuable insights and guidance to the contestants. Despite its cancellation in 2016, American Idol found new life when it was revived by ABC in 2018. Ryan Seacrest returned as the host, and new judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie were introduced to the show. This version of American Idol continues to air, with the 19th season premiering in February 2021. In conclusion, Fox announced the cancellation of American Idol in May 2015, deciding to end the show after its fifteenth season in 2016. The statement provided does not answer the question, as it only refers to the host and judges during the later seasons of the show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question...who is the boy that plays the banjo on deliverance??","output":"The boy who plays the banjo in the 1972 film \\"Deliverance\\" is portrayed by a local Georgian named Billy Redden. He was not a professional actor at the time but was specifically chosen for the role due to his unique appearance and the film's demand for an authentic, \\"backwoods\\" look. In the movie, Redden played the character named Lonnie, who participates in the memorable \\"Dueling Banjos\\" scene where he engages in a musical duel with one of the main characters, Drew Ballinger, portrayed by actor Ronny Cox. The scene has since become iconic in popular culture, showcasing the combination of bluegrass music and the tension between the rural and urban characters. Although Redden visually portrayed the banjo-playing boy, it's important to note that he did not actually play the banjo himself. The intricate banjo music was played by a professional musician named Eric Weissberg, while Redden used a specially-designed prop banjo with a pantomime-like performance. A skilled banjo player, Mike Addis, was hidden behind Redden during the scene, reaching around him to play the required notes on the real banjo. This \\"movie magic\\" helped create the illusion that Redden's character was a talented banjo player.  After his performance in \\"Deliverance,\\" Redden took a long hiatus from acting and held various jobs, including working as a dishwasher and cook in Georgia. He later made a return to acting with minor roles in Tim Burton's film \\"Big Fish\\" (2003) and the independent film \\"Outrage: Born in Terror\\" (2009). The role of Lonnie in \\"Deliverance\\" marked the beginning of Redden's acting career, and he remains best-known for this memorable part in the classic film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The politicians far away in Washington could not know the settlers so they must make rules to regulate *them* .","output":"Yes, in the given sentence, the pronouns \\"settlers\\" and \\"them\\" point to the same group of people. To understand this more clearly, let's break down the sentence. The sentence states: \\"The politicians far away in Washington could not know the settlers so they must make rules to regulate them.\\" The sentence presents two main subjects: \\"politicians\\" and \\"settlers.\\" The politicians are located far away in Washington, while the settlers are presumably located elsewhere. The sentence goes on to express that the politicians do not have personal knowledge of the settlers. Therefore, the reference to \\"they\\" in the latter part of the sentence likely points to the politicians, as the pronoun is used to indicate that the politicians must create rules. Now, let's consider the pronoun \\"them.\\" In this context, \\"them\\" is an object pronoun, meaning that it is being used to indicate the receiver of an action (in this case, regulation). Since \\"settlers\\" is the only other noun in the sentence apart from \\"politicians,\\" and the politicians are the ones who must make the rules, it is clear that \\"them\\" refers to the \\"settlers.\\" In conclusion, in the sentence \\"The politicians far away in Washington could not know the settlers so they must make rules to regulate them,\\" both \\"settlers\\" and \\"them\\" refer to the same group of people, who are being regulated by the politicians located far away in Washington."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Adam Scully-Power ran 163 miles without sleeping. It took him 41 hours and 33 minutes and he did it to raise money for cancer and to honor Boston Marathon victims. He only stopped to stretch his legs, eat and change his shirt. Otherwise, he kept going, all the way across Massachusetts. Scully-Power, 39, ran the Pan-Mass Cycling challenge, an annual bike-a-thon that raises money for cancer research and treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He started at 5:45 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 2 and finished at 11:18 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 3. “It was two sunrises, two sunsets and lots of running and no sleep,” he told For The Win. “Slowly but surely trucked through and covered the distance.” A year ago, Scully-Power was 50 pounds heavier and didn’t recognize himself in pictures. He had wrestled in high school and did triathlons in his early 20s, but he’s married, has four kids and a full-time job, so staying in shape fell by the wayside. He couldn’t even run a 2-mile loop near his house without stopping. He watched the documentary film “Forks over Knives,” which promotes healthy eating through a whole food, plant-based diet and cuts out meat, dairy and processed foods. A couple weeks later, Scully-Power changed his eating habits. “What I found was that the first two weeks was like going through a detox program, or what I envisioned that to be like,” he said. “And then all of a sudden, my energy levels went through the roof. It was amazing.” Within six weeks, he was running 12-13 miles. One day last December, he ran into his friend David Green, who competes in ultramarathons, at Starbucks. The two talked about a 110-mile race in their hometown of Ponte Vedra, Fla. Green was training for. “Then he stopped talking, looked me square in the eyes and said, ‘You should do it with me,’” Scully-Power said. “I thought he was insane. Running over 100 miles was incomprehensible.” But in February, Scully-Power ran 110 miles in 24 hours and 38 minutes. Before running a second ultramarathon in May, the Boston Marathon occurred and Green was at the finish line when the blasts went off. Scully-Power immediately texted his friend to make sure he was OK. Green was fine, and had snapped one picture before helping victims. Green later sent his photo to the FBI, which was then released to the media, because unbeknownst to him, he had captured a “crystal clear” image of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking away from the scene on Boylston Street. That photo became the catalyst for Scully-Power running a 163-mile bike race. “It was a sign it was meant to be,” he said. In the days following the tragedy, Scully-Power recalled a conversation with a co-worker at their investment firm Columbia Management, which is based in Boston, who had told him about the Pan-Mass Challenge, and that they might get a company team together. He emailed the race director and inquired about running instead of biking. “I think he thought I was crazy,” Scully-Power said. But the mission was a go. To train, on weekends Scully-Power would wake up at 3:30 a.m. and run from 4-9. If one of his kids had a lacrosse game 20 miles away, he’d run there instead of drive. Scully-Power ran across Massachusetts by himself, but he wasn’t alone. His wife, brother, father and father-in-law followed him in their own vehicle with supplies like water, food and change of clothes. Scully-Power did a TV spot on CBS the week before his run and people driving by on the street would recognize him. He said one man joined him at 10 o’clock Friday night and they ran together for a couple of hours. He also received encouraging text messages and emails along the way. “I wasn’t trying to put up a specific time,” he said. “I had a relaxed mentality. It was all about raising money and awareness, not trying to set world records.” Each year, those riding in the PMC must raise between 500 and 5,000 in order to participate. Scully-Power’s goal was 25,000 and just like in his training and eating habits, he exceeded expectations, raising over 26,000 through his website whywerun.com. “It fundamentally changes your perspective of what’s possible in all facets of your life,” Scully-Power said of running and raising money. “So what’s next? I’m not sure, but there will be something.” Write a title for it.","output":"Man runs 163 miles without sleep to raise money for cancer research and honor Boston Marathon victims"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context: The Men in Black are a secret law-enforcement agency that is responsible for policing the extraterrestrial life hidden on Earth, as well as protecting the world from any aliens who attempt to destroy/invade the planet.The film begins on LunarMax, a MiB prison situated on the moon. A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further. That night, as K waits for Boris with a gun in his hand, he suddenly vanishes...The next morning, J discovers that he has a new partner, the liberated Agent AA, and that K has been dead for forty years (having been killed by Boris the Animal on 16th July 1969). O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for). At this point a Boglodite armada appears; J learns that there was nothing to hold them at bay, with no K to deploy the ArcNet. He theorizes that Boris went back in time to 1969 to kill K, thus changing history to what it was, and proposes to follow him; he heads to Jeffrey Price, who had provided Boris a time-jump device, and gets another one from him, and activates it by jumping off the Chrysler Building just as the Boglodites begin their assault...J arrives in 15 July 1969, with the intention to catch Boris as he is about to murder Roman the Fabulous. However, he is delayed from navigating the era of 1969 (most notably by an altercation with two racist cops), and gets there too late to stop Romans murder by 1969 Boris. He encounters 1969 Agent K, who subdues him and brings him to MiB headquarters. J tells K nothing, but when threatened with getting his memory erased he tells K part of the truth: he came from the future in pursuit of another time-traveler whos trying to change history.K and J follow a trail of clues to Andy Warhols Factory complex, where Warhol is revealed to be MiB Agent W. He notifies them of Griffin, an Arcanian being who has the ability to foresee all timelines and futures; Griffins planet was destroyed by the Boglodites, so he came to live on Earth and brought with him a device which will prevent the Boglodites from consuming the Earth. 1969 Boris arrives at the Factory in search of Griffin, who makes a quick exit with Boris in fast pursuit (to Js displeasure, although K doesnt seem to get too worried).J and K eventually track down Griffin at Shea Stadium, where he is foreseeing the future victory for the Mets baseball team. 1969 Boris appears and captures Griffin, but J and K are able to rescue Griffin, although Boris gets away. Griffin gives them the ArcNet and explains it can only work in zero gravity: K gets the idea to head to Cape Canaveral on 16th July 1969 (the day the Apollo 11 ship launched)   Question: What is needed to protect the Earth from the Boglodite invasion?

Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: By Constantius's order, the sole ruler of The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the Council of Arles in 353, was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of Capua, in the name of Pope Liberius. The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control it, at Milan. Milan was named as the place, here three hundred bishops assembled, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of Dionysius (bishop of Milan), and the two Papal Legates, viz., Eusebius of Vercelli and Lucifer of Cagliari, consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.","output":"The detailed title of this article can be constructed as follows: \\"The Council of Arles (353) and the Subsequent Council of Milan (355): The Struggle Against Arianism, Emperor Constantius's Interventions, and Pope Liberius's Rejection of Coerced Decrees\\".

Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin.  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .

When I saw the Nile cafe, I got a little giddy because I always imagined an adorable little cafe in one of those precious live/work units lining Roosevelt. (Tammie Coe doesn't count. No sitting room inside!)    I stopped in for lunch today. Now, take this review with a grain of salt because I a) only ordered one thing and b) I got it to-go.   There are 4 or 5 tables in the dining area, with not much breathing room in between. The server/cashier seemed tired and wasn't too friendly. He seemed annoyed that I asked for a take-out order.   The menu is really limited, and strange. Not offering a traditional sampler plate with goodies like hummus, dolmas, and falafel gets them an immediate thumbs down.  I got the chicken shawarma sandwich. At 7.95, I expected it to be a little more substantial. It was all chicken, and the chicken was pretty dry.  There was quite a bit of nasty yellow lettuce that got picked off, but there were pickles and maybe a few tomato chunks in there somewhere. I think I tasted one. The pita bread was a little rubbery- like it was warmed in the microwave. No bueno.   I know, I know, I shouldn't be whining about a chicken sandwich having too much chicken. Balance is important though, and this sandwich had nowhere near enough complementary flavors to make it a winner.   Sub par sandwich aside, I will give the Nile cafe another try and edit accordingly. I don't feel like I gave it a fair shake with a sandwich to go. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative with a slight possibility of change.

The death toll rose by 743 on Tuesday, the second highest daily tally since the outbreak emerged in northern regions on Feb. 21, and up steeply from the 602 recorded on Monday. Italy has seen more fatalities than any other country, with latest figures showing that 6,820 people have died from the infection in barely a month. The total number of confirmed cases hit 69,176 on Tuesday, but with Italy testing only people with severe symptoms, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said the true number of infected people was probably 10 times higher. “A ratio of one certified case out of every 10 is credible,” Angelo Borrelli told La Repubblica newspaper, indicating he believed some 700,000 people could have been infected. The latest data comes as a disappointment to a country that has been in lockdown for two weeks, with schools, bars and restaurants shut and Italians forbidden from leaving their homes for all but essential needs. On Monday the government closed all businesses not deemed to be essential to the nation’s supply chain of vital requirements, and after the latest figures Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stiffened fines for people leaving their homes to up to 3,000 euros (3,225) from a previous maximum of 206 euros. “Every one of us must play our part,” he told reporters at a news conference held by remote video link to avoid contagion. “If everyone obeys the rules they don’t only protect themselves and their loved ones, but they will enable the whole national community to come out of this emergency.”  Current restrictions are due to remain in place until April 3, but there is speculation the date will have to be pushed back given the continual rise in cases across the country. A decree issued on Tuesday gave the government the power to extend the deadline to July 31. However, Conte denied planning to keep the lockdown in place until that date, saying he hoped to loosen curbs “well before then”. Investment bank Goldman Sachs forecast on Tuesday that the Italian economy, already teetering on recession before the outbreak hit, would shrink by more than 11% this year. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri told parliament he expected a contraction of “a few percentage points”. The Civil Protection Agency said the biggest difficulty facing the health service was a shortage of masks and ventilators - a problem that has dogged hospitals since the start of the outbreak. Underscoring the problem, the regional governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, ordered the confiscation of ventilators at veterinary surgeries, saying they could be converted to human use. With other countries looking to hoard their own medical supplies, a consortium of Italian textile and fashion companies have converted their production lines and will soon be able to produce half the required amount of masks. “(This) will give our system the ammunition that we need in order to fight this war and avoid our total dependence on imports,” Domenico Arcuri, the national commissioner for the emergency, told reporters. The government has said a number of industrial sectors, including medical suppliers, must keep operating during the crisis, but there is growing unhappiness amongst some unions who think the list of strategic concerns is too wide. Workers in the metal, chemical, textile, rubber-plastic and paper industries are expected to go on strike on Wednesday, alarming the government, which is holding talks with unions to try to stave off the stoppages. “The last thing that Italy can allow itself is industrial conflict in a situation of national emergency,” deputy Economy Minister Antonio Misiani told SkyTG24 television.","output":"Italy has the highest number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 outbreak, with over 6,820 deaths and around 69,176 confirmed cases by Tuesday.

Bern is the capital city of Switzerland and has a rich history that dates back to its founding in the 12th century. Originally, Bern was situated on a hilly peninsula, which provided both natural defense and a strategic location bounded by the River Aare. As the city grew in size and influence through the centuries, it eventually encountered the need to expand beyond its initial boundaries. During the 19th century, significant developments took place in Bern and the rest of Europe. The Industrial Revolution brought rapid technological, economic, and population growth. The advancements in transportation, urban planning, and engineering allowed cities to expand and modernize. The city of Bern, with its growing population and evolving needs, saw that its original peninsula location had become inadequate to accommodate these changes. As a result, Bern outgrew its natural peninsula boundaries in the 19th century, with developments and expansions that included new bridges, buildings, and infrastructures. The city expanded across the river as well as towards the surrounding countryside, gradually transforming it into the modern capital that it is today. The fact that Bern has been able to preserve its rich historical and architectural heritage while embracing urban development and expansion is a testament to the city's ability to adapt and evolve over time. In conclusion, the statement accurately answers the question about the century when Bern outgrew its original peninsula location, which occurred during the 19th century. This was an important period for Bern, as it marked the beginning of a new era of growth and modernization in the city, with significant implications for its infrastructure and architectural landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Notes above the 100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. These notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.

In many cases, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula. For example, the molecular formula of methane is CH 4 , and because 1:4 is the smallest whole-number ratio that can be written for this compound, that is also its empirical formula.

How to file a demurrer to a complaint  Read the complaint.  You will receive a copy of the complaint, usually by hand-delivery. You should take out a pencil and highlighter and read the whole document.","output":"Step 1: Research the applicable laws and rules Before starting the demurrer process, you need to familiarize yourself with the laws and rules that govern demurrers in the relevant jurisdiction. This generally includes your jurisdiction's civil procedure rules and any court-specific or local procedural rules that may apply. This research will help you make sure you are following the correct procedure and meeting any required deadlines. Step 2: Analyze the complaint for legal sufficiency After reading the complaint, carefully analyze it to determine if there is a valid basis for a demurrer. A demurrer is typically filed when the complaint is legally insufficient – that is, the complaint fails to state a cause of action or lacks essential elements required by law. Identify the specific grounds for the demurrer based on the deficiencies you have found in the complaint. Step 3: Prepare the demurrer document Once you have identified the grounds for the demurrer, prepare the demurrer document itself. This should include a legal caption (title of the case), an introduction explaining your role in the case (e.g., defendant) and that you are filing a demurrer, and the specific grounds for the demurrer. Also, include any supporting legal authorities (e.g., statutes or case law) that help justify your position. Be sure to follow any formatting and citation requirements applicable to your jurisdiction. Step 4: Draft accompanying documents In addition to the demurrer, you may need to prepare additional documents, such as a memorandum of points and authorities, which is a more detailed explanation of the legal reasons supporting the demurrer, and a proof of service, which is a document showing that you have properly served the demurrer on all relevant parties. Consult the jurisdiction's applicable rules to determine what additional documents must be submitted and their specific requirements. Step 5: Serve the demurrer on all relevant parties Follow the rules of your jurisdiction to properly serve the demurrer and any accompanying documents on all relevant parties, which usually includes the plaintiff who filed the complaint. This may require personal service or service by mail, depending on the rules. Step 6: File the demurrer with the court After properly serving the demurrer, file it and all accompanying documents with the court within the deadline specified by the jurisdiction's rules. In most cases, you will need to submit the original signed documents as well as any required copies. Be prepared to pay any filing fees associated with filing the demurrer. Step 7: Attend any required hearings Once the demurrer is filed, the court may schedule a hearing to discuss the demurrer and determine whether to sustain (agree with) or overrule (disagree with) it. Be prepared to attend the hearing and present your arguments on why the demurrer should be sustained. If the court sustains the demurrer, the complaint may be dismissed, and the plaintiff may have the opportunity to amend it. If the court overrules the demurrer, the case will proceed, and you will need to prepare to defend the lawsuit through the discovery process, pre-trial motions, and potential trial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who give Holly romantic advice? Movie title: The Perfect Man Movie plot: Single mother Jean (Heather Locklear) relocates every time she gets her heart broken by another guy, much to the dismay of her teenage daughter, Holly (Hilary Duff). Holly devises a plan to invent a secret admirer for her mother, so she'll be happy and not have to relocate anymore. Holly overhears her friend Amy's (Vanessa Lengies) uncle Ben (Chris Noth) ordering flowers for a woman, and decides to use his advice on women (which she acquires by telling him she needs help for a school project on romance). Following Ben's advice, she sends her mother orchids and other gifts and love notes, and is soon communicating with her mother as this fictitious admirer (who Holly names Ben) via the internet. As her mother becomes more interested, Holly has to find a photo of this admirer. She sends one of the real Ben, and then devises a reason why they can't meet in person, claiming he is working in China. While she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam (Ben Feldman), but is unwilling to get close to anyone due to her history of being uprooted and having to say goodbye so often. As the charade continues, and as Holly spends more time with Ben while picking his brain for romance tips, she slowly begins to see qualities in Ben which make her believe he is her mother's 'perfect man.' Unfortunately there is no way her mother can ever meet the real Ben without Holly's plan being exposed. Holly asks help from Adam to disguise as Ben in the telephone and break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is revealed to be harboring feelings for Holly as well, in effect telling Holly's mother the opposite of what is planned. Next day at school, Adam admits his feelings for Holly by kissing her. That night, Lenny (Mike O'Malley), a man who is infatuated with Jean, proposes to her and she replies with a 'maybe'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The park bench facing Lake Washington is covered with flowers, poems, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and graffiti.  Fans leave flowers and mementos in honor of Kurt Cobain near his Seattle home.  \\"I miss your beautiful face and voice,\\" one dedication reads.  \\"Thank you for inspiring me,\\" says another.  \\"RIP Kurt.\\"  Fifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician.  The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills.  His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions.  Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple.  Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye.  What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire.  \\"At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,\\" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches.

Question: What will Tracy want to do next?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: use force to take it back  B: apologize to Lee for stealing  C: laugh at Tracy The answer is:","output":"A: use force to take it back Based on the context provided, we can deduce that Tracy might want to resort to using force to take back her lunchbox after Lee refuses to give it back willingly. This conclusion stems from the antagonism created by the situation - Lee stealing Tracy's lunchbox and then refusing to return it even after Tracy's asking. While it is not always appropriate or advisable to use force in a conflict, it is understandable that Tracy may feel compelled to attempt to retrieve her stolen property. It is important to highlight that the use of force does not necessarily imply violence, but suggests that Tracy could employ a stronger approach or assertiveness to reclaim her lunchbox, such as confronting Lee or seeking help from an authority figure like a teacher. Option B, \\"apologize to Lee for stealing,\\" is not appropriate since Tracy is not the one who stole the lunchbox, and therefore, there is no reason for her to apologize for the theft. Instead, Lee is the person who committed the wrongful act and should be the one to apologize. Option C, \\"laugh at Tracy,\\" also does not follow the context given. Laughing at Tracy does not provide any resolution to the situation or help address her desire to reclaim her lunchbox. Furthermore, this option appears to involve mockery, which could add to the negative dynamics of the situation. Thus, based on the given context, the best answer is option A: use force to take it back. This choice acknowledges Tracy's desire to reclaim her lunchbox after Lee's theft and refusal and recognizes the potential escalation the situation might cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the correct answer because the passage is discussing the possibility of an alternative model to Twitter without ads and promoted tweets. Since App.net intends to be a Twitter-like social network that charges users instead of relying on advertising, it makes sense that the passage is referring to an alternative path Twitter itself could have taken. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - App.net: The passage is discussing the potential success of App.net's model, not an alternative path it could have taken. - CNN: The passage is about social media platforms, not news organizations like CNN, so it's not relevant to the discussion. - Dalton Caldwell: He is the founder and CEO of App.net, but the passage is about the platforms and not about an individual's alternate career path. - Facebook: While the passage refers to the advertising models of sites like Twitter and Facebook, it specifically discusses a Twitter-like social network, making Twitter the correct answer. - Kickstarter: The passage only mentions Kickstarter as a comparison to App.net's fundraising campaign and not as an alternative business model for the platforms being discussed."},{"instruction":"Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.
