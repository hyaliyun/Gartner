A:","output":"Yes, packing the hospital bag indeed makes for a valid answer when discussing the preparations Casey needs to make ahead of Cameron's impending birth. The hospital bag is essential for both the birthing person and their partner.  There are several elements that comprise the hospital bag. For Cameron, these might include clothing — such as a robe, maternity bra, nursing pads, and comfortable, loose-fitting pieces for post-delivery — and toiletries, from toothbrush and toothpaste to deodorant and face wash. She might also want to pack personal items, like prescription medications and glasses, and comfort items, like her own pillow or relaxation materials for labor. For the newborn, the bag should include newborn clothing, diapers, baby wipes, receiving blanket, and car seat. For Casey, the bag should have a change of clothes, toiletries, snacks, and a list of important contacts and emergency numbers. They might also want to pack a phone charger, comfortable shoes, and items to aid in relaxation and support for Cameron, like a book to read to her during early labor or a list of soothing music. The idea behind packing these items is to ensure that both Cameron and Casey have everything they need for a comfortable, stress-free labor and delivery experience. Cameron will be able to focus on her labor knowing all necessary items for her, Casey, and the newborn are prepared. By packing the hospital bag ahead of time, Casey is exhibiting the qualities of a good partner — consideration, preparation, and a share in the responsibilities of baby preparation. It shows they are taking this role as a partner seriously, putting Cameron's needs and comfort first, and preparing for this major milestone in their life together. They are also ensuring that when the time comes for Cameron to be taken to the hospital, there will be one less thing to worry about in the flurry of activity that will ensue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the summer of 1940, world-weary Harry Morgan operates a small fishing-boat, the Queen Conch, in Fort-de-France, on the French colony of Martinique.  It is not long since the fall of France and the island is controlled by pro-German Vichy France. Harry makes a modest living chartering his fishing boat to tourists, along with his unofficial mate Eddie. Eddie is Harry's close friend and one time trusted co-worker, but he has of late become an alcoholic. The island is a tinder-box of dissent, harboring many people sympathetic to Free France. At his hotel home, hotel owner Gérard (known as \\"Frenchy\\" to English speakers) urges Harry to help the French Resistance by smuggling some people off the island. Harry steadfastly refuses, choosing to keep aloof from the current political situation. Also at the hotel, he meets Marie Browning, a young American wanderer who has recently arrived in Martinique. An accomplished singer, she sings \\"How Little We Know\\" with pianist Cricket in the hotel bar. Harry's current charter client, Johnson, owes Harry 825. Johnson insists he hasn't enough ready money, but promises to get the funds when the banks open the next day. In the hotel bar, Harry notices Slim pick Johnson's pocket and he later forces her to hand over the wallet. On inspection the wallet is found to contain 1,400 in traveler's cheques and a plane ticket for early the next morning (before the banks are open). On returning the wallet to Johnson, Harry demands that Johnson sign the traveler's cheques to pay him immediately. But just then, there is a shootout in front of the hotel between police and the Resistance, and Johnson is killed by a stray bullet. The police take Harry and several others for questioning, and seize Harry's passport and money.

The reviewer shares their experience with the printer, stating that it performed well initially but later faced significant issues that affected its functionality.

Tell me who he is.","output":"Mitt Romney and Rick Perry are both American politicians and prominent members of the Republican Party. Mitt Romney, full name Willard Mitt Romney, was born on March 12, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan. He is a successful businessman and politician. Romney served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Prior to his political career, Romney was the CEO of Bain & Company, a management consulting firm, and later, the co-founder of Bain Capital, a private equity firm. He was also the CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah. Rick Perry, full name James Richard Perry, was born on March 4, 1950, in Haskell, Texas. He is a politician and veteran, serving as the 47th Governor of Texas from 2000 until 2015. Before becoming the Governor of Texas, Perry was the state's Commissioner of Agriculture from 1991 to 1999 and served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. Perry also had a short stint as the United States Secretary of Energy under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019. He is a U.S. Air Force veteran and a staunch conservative. During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, both Romney and Perry sought the nomination as the Republican candidate for the presidency. There was a notable moment in which Perry encountered backlash over his support for a Texas program providing in-state tuition rates for the children of undocumented immigrants. In a heated debate, Perry defended the program and said, \\"If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.\\" Some Republicans saw Perry's comment as an attack on the many conservative voters who disagreed with the program, and Romney capitalized on this perception, painting himself as a more moderate and pragmatic candidate who understood the concerns of the party's base. As the primaries continued, Romney also presented himself as a more capable and experienced leader in terms of economic policy, given his successful background in the private sector. Ultimately, Republican voters preferred Romney over Perry in the 2012 primaries for a variety of reasons, including Romney's perceived economic competence and concerns over Perry's support for providing benefits to the children of undocumented immigrants. This preference culminated in Romney winning the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, though he went on to lose the election to the incumbent president, Barack Obama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeing Seahawks dominate Broncos with defense makes you think Rex Ryan is onto something with NY Jets You watched this Super Bowl game, watched the Seahawks come after Peyton Manning and crowd him to the point where he must have felt like he was a fan at one of those Jersey train stations trying to make it to MetLife Stadium, and here is what you had to think: That maybe Rex Ryan isn't so crazy thinking his team can play football the way he wants it to play and win the way he thinks it can win. Which means the way Pete Carroll's Seahawks played and won Sunday night. It doesn't mean that the Jets are anywhere close to having the kind of talent, up and down the roster, that the Seahawks do. Or that Rex's immediate boss — John Idzik — can put the whole thing together the way Idzik's old boss, John Schneider, so clearly has out there in 12th Man America. Most of all, no one is saying that Geno Smith can ever play with the kind of poise and imagination and sure right arm that Russell Wilson did in Jersey, on the night when he became one of the youngest quarterbacks to ever win the big game. And you know the deal on this, if Geno isn’t Rex’s guy or Idzik’s guy, even short term, it means they have to find somebody with whom they think they can win. Still: As the Jets try to become a winner again, you look at their defense, see the athleticism and speed and power especially in the front of that defense — nobody in the sport has guys like Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas in the defensive backfield — and think that Rex’s vision of how you do it isn’t so different from an old Jet coach named Carroll’s vision. “We played football the way we like to play it,” Carroll said on the night when he joined Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer as coaches who have won it all in both college football and the pros. Guys like to play for Pete Carroll, they always have, even when he couldn't win the way he wanted to with the Jets and with the Patriots after that. Guys clearly like to play for Rex Ryan. Rex now works for a general manager, Idzik, who knows exactly what the plan was to build a champion in Seattle. Idzik seeing it all come together the year after he leaves and comes to the Jets. Maybe it turns out, then, that Idzik and Ryan are closer in philosophy or vision or whatever you want to call it than we thought when Idzik took the job, even if Ryan is working on a contract that seems to be more complicated than some of his blitzes. Say it again today: Considering who the Seahawks were up against Sunday night — Peyton Manning having the season of his life — and what they were up against — a Broncos offense that had averaged 38 points a game — this defensive performance stands with anything that has ever happened in the history of the Super Bowl. Noll’s Steelers. Ditka’s Bears. Ray Lewis and the Ravens. Anybody. Carroll’s guys took what was supposed to be a game about Manning’s legacy and made it about their own, and taking their place with the most storied defenses this game had ever seen. \\"We are so proud to put our stamp on the world championship the way we did tonight,\\" Carroll kept saying afterward. It doesn't mean the Seahawks are about to become a dynasty, we always hear that after somebody wins the Super Bowl, even when one team hasn't thrown the other out a window the way the Seahawks did with the Broncos. Right. The Seahawks are so much of a budding dynasty that two weeks before they did what they did to the Broncos, Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers had a ball in the air to beat them in Seattle. You want to know another team that thought of itself as a budding dynasty about 10 minutes ago? Jim Harbaugh’s 49ers, that’s who. Only Kaepernick couldn’t complete the pass that would have won the last Super Bowl in New Orleans, to Michael Crabtree, right side of the end zone. Then Richard Sherman deflected another ball intended for Crabtree and that ball fell into Malcolm Smith’s hands. Now Smith is the Super Bowl MVP and the Seahawks are the Super Bowl champs. But as you watched them become the champs the way they did, totally dominating the Broncos, a non-scrambling quarterback like Manning turning out to be much more of a dream opponent for them than Kaepernick was; as you watched them do this in the stadium shared by the Giants and Jets, you really could see Rex Ryan's Jets being a lot closer to a moment like this than the Giants are, just because the Giants have a whole lot more work to do building themselves another championship defense. It doesn't mean that the Jets can use all this cap space to spend their way there. Or that Idzik can draft his way there. If you're sure about Geno being the quarterback of both the present and the future, raise a hand. But if the Seahawks, winning this way with defense in what has become a passing league, are the current model franchise, Rex must be thinking, wait a minute, I made it to the AFC championship game with my own kid quarterback trying to build the exact same model! The country saw what happened on Sunday night, the way the Seahawks got after it, the way they closed on those short passes, the way they hit, the way they dared Manning to take shots down the field. You know Rex had to look at the whole thing differently, the Seahawks doing it this way in his stadium. You know Rex Ryan really thought this: That could be us. Sooner rather than later. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Seahawks' dominating defensive performance against the Broncos in the Super Bowl showcased a potential path to success for the New York Jets under Rex Ryan. While the Jets may not have the same level of talent as the Seahawks, their strong defense, particularly in the front, aligns with Pete Carroll's winning strategy. General Manager John Idzik, who worked with the Seahawks before joining the Jets, appears to have a similar philosophy to Ryan in terms of team building. The Jets will need to find a quarterback who can lead the offense effectively, but their defense provides a solid foundation for potential success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Alina Bogdanova was found lifeless by Aleksandrs Zuks, 29, the next morning, after the pair rekindled their romance, an inquest today heard. The 28-year-old blonde had spent the night of October 25 last year with her ex-boyfriend, who lived with her brother in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Alina Bogdanova (right) hanged herself after sleeping with her ex-boyfriend Aleksandrs Zuks (left) behind her new partner's back. Mr Zuks found the 28-year-old's lifeless body the morning after the pair rekindled their romance last October. Giving evidence at an inquest at South Lincolnshire Coroners Court, Mr Zuks, said: 'We slept together after she came to my bedroom. 'I fell asleep with her beside me but found her the next morning. I thought she was standing on the stairway next to the wall. 'I started talking and asking what she was doing there and when I came closer I realised that her bottom lip was blue.' At the time of her death, Miss Bogdanova was in a relationship with fellow Russian Arturas Pakalniskis, who lived in Peterborough. He told the inquest: 'She was very happy. She wasn’t depressed. 'I knew Mr Zuks lived at her brother’s address but I was not concerned (about her visiting the house). 'She just said that \\"I am going to see my brother\\" and that was it.' Miss Bogdanova was visiting her brother Arnis, who lived with Mr Zuks in Spalding, Lincolnshire on October 25 last year. Mr Zuks told an inquest into her death she had fallen asleep beside him. South Lincolnshire assistant coroner Siobhan Kelly recorded a verdict of suicide. A friend paying tribute said: 'Alina was a beautiful person.

In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a, 5b' is allowed, and '5b, 2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Title: Tim was two years old when his family moved to the country. Tim was not used to this, as he was from the big city. Tim spent a lot of his day exploring the large yard of his new home. Choices: a. Over time, Tim began to love the freedom the country provided. b. Tim decided that he would never visit the city again. c. He did it and then went back to laying down.","output":"Analyzing the title and the given sentences, the story appears to revolve around Tim's new country life after shifting from the big city. Tim's exploration of his new home and his adaptation to this new environment are the running themes. Looking at options a, b, and c, I can note the following: a. This sentence builds upon the theme of Tim adapting and becoming fond of his new environment. This is a compelling choice since it connects well with him exploring his new home (yard). b. This sentence implies a strong disconnection with the city, which might not necessarily be true just from few sentences we have.  c. This sentence seems to be out of place. There is no mention of laying down or a connected event in the current story. Given these observations, the sentence 'Over time, Tim began to love the freedom the country provided' seems to smoothly continue the narrative, as it elaborates on Tim's emotional transition caused by his physical relocation. I conclude that option 'a' should follow after 'Tim spent a lot of his day exploring the large yard of his new home,' thus making it the fourth sentence of the story. Testing option 'b', it also seems to logically fit the sequence as the final sentence. It shows the result of Tim getting used to and even preferring the new country life now. On the other hand, option 'c' doesn't align with any relevant notion and seems arbitrary. Thus, it can be discarded. Therefore, the correct answer should be '4a, 5b', with option 'a' becoming the fourth sentence and option 'b' the concluding, fifth sentence of the narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B?  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided and the definition of temperature in physics, the answer would be that particle B would have a lower temperature.

The public is shocked to hear the news of his arrest, as Radcliffe is known for his benevolent nature and strong sense of justice. Despite his pleas of innocence and the lack of substantial evidence, the jury, swayed by the accusatory stories surrounding the high-profile case, unanimously finds him guilty. Knowing that Radcliffe has been wronged and having a strong belief in his innocence, Dr. Frank Griffin, a scientist and Radcliffe's close friend, decides to take matters into his own hands. On the eve of the execution, the daring scientist enters the prison and covertly injects Radcliffe with an experimental invisibility drug, one he had been secretly developing for quite some time. Miraculously, the drug works, and Radcliffe disappears from sight. Taking advantage of the confusion that ensues in the prison, Radcliffe manages to escape, determined to clear his name and find the true murderer. After getting the hang of his newfound invisibility and learning from Dr. Griffin how to use it to the best of his abilities, Radcliffe begins his mission to find the real killer. He secretly investigates his former business colleagues, as well as his own family members, in search of answers. The first lead he comes across is a recently promoted employee, Willie Spears, who has suddenly climbed the ranks within Radcliffe's company. The speed of his rise to power seems suspicious and motivates Radcliffe to delve deeper into Willie's background. During his investigation, Radcliffe uncovers a myriad of lies and secrets, which ultimately leads him to confront a man named Cobb. As it turns out, Cobb is the true killer, responsible for Michael's murder. In a thrilling confrontation, the two men fight on top of a speeding coal wagon. Radcliffe's invisibility not only aids him in overcoming Cobb but also leaves the murderer feeling as if he is battling a ghost. Cobb finally confesses to the murder, unable to bear the terrifying feeling that his sins have returned to haunt him. However, before Radcliffe can bring him to justice, Cobb is killed as he loses his balance and falls off the moving coal wagon. With Cobb's confession, Radcliffe's innocence is finally acknowledged, and the hunt for him comes to an end. However, the invisibility drug's effects are irreversible, and Radcliffe is forced to live the remainder of his life as an invisible man. He takes up a new role as a protector of justice, using his invisibility to uncover hidden truths and help those who cannot help themselves. The most extraordinary aspect of Radcliffe's new life is his newfound ability to be heard and not seen. Vincent Price, a famous actor with an iconic voice, becomes Radcliffe's disembodied voice throughout the rest of the film. As Radcliffe continues his invisible crusade against evil, Vincent Price's haunting voiceover sends shivers down the spine of every evildoer who crosses paths with the once wrongfully accused Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Luckily, there are some easy options for beginners that will create the look you want in your aquarium. Look for plants that are labeled as Echinoderms, Lilaeopsis, Anarchies, or Anubis.  Good options for tall plants include Amazon Sword and Java Fern. Amazon Sword grows quickly and easily, providing great cover for your wiring and filter system if it’s visible from behind your tank. Java Fern has long leaves and provides good protection for fish. For medium-sized plants, great choices include Anubias Nana and Dwarf Sagittaria. Anubias Nana has curved stems with rounded leaves. Dwarf Sagittaria has long green leaves with curved blades and grows well around hard tank decorations like stone figurines. Easy to grow freshwater mosses include Java Moss, Willow Moss, and Water Wisteria. Moss is a low-growing plant, so you can put it in the front of your tank without obscuring other plants. It also helps keep your tank clean. Moss grows quickly, so you will see fast results with this plant.  Moss grows best with medium to bright light.  Mosses are often edible for fish. You will still need to feed your fish, however. Not all fish will eat the moss. Another great option for the bottom and forefront of your tank is a plant called dwarf baby tears. This lush, leafy plant grows quickly like moss but it has a more shrub-like appearance. This plant grows best in bright light. Full grown plants are more expensive, but they are the easiest way to get the look you want immediately. Choose plants that have started to bud and have white roots.  Inspect the plants to make sure that they are free of snails, shrimp, and algae.  You can buy aquarium plants at a local pet shop or aquarium store. You can also find them online. Research the seller before you make a purchase to ensure that they have a reputation for clean, healthy plants. While it will take longer for your final look to develop, cuttings are more economical. To grow them, you will need to acquire cuttings from an existing plant, which are sold through most aquarium stores and online. Locate the lowest stem node on your cutting, then remove the leaves below it. Plant the stem in the substrate so that it will take root. You may also be able to acquire a cutting from someone you know who owns an aquarium. Layering your plants will make your tank more attractive. Background plants should be larger, while medium-sized plants can be placed in the middle of the aquarium or along the sides. You can decorate the front of your aquarium with a carpeting plant, like moss or dwarf baby tears.  Plants range from small 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) plants up to plants that fill the tank. Add figurines, rocks, and driftwood for a more interesting look. They will also provide a great place to tie down plants that do not need to be buried. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, maintaining a freshwater aquarium can be made easier for beginners by carefully selecting appropriate plants that require minimal care and have different sizes and growth patterns. Echinoderms, Lilaeopsis, Anarchies, and Anubis are some recommended plant types. Tall plants like Amazon Sword and Java Fern help create cover for wiring and filter systems, while medium-sized plants, such as Anubias Nana and Dwarf Sagittaria, can be placed around tank decorations. Mosses like Java Moss, Willow Moss, and Water Wisteria are suitable for the front of the tank and come with the added advantage of helping to keep the tank clean. Dwarf baby tears is another excellent foreground plant option with a shrub-like appearance. Purchasing plants with budding and white roots ensures healthy specimens, and layering plants of varying sizes can make the aquarium more visually appealing. Incorporating figurines, rocks, and driftwood can enhance the overall look and provide support for certain plant types."},{"instruction":"Q:It was their first official date.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Parkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003. As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers  drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell  along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000.   - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\"  - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners.  - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records .  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor.

Article: Hetty Robinson learnt all about money when very young. As a child, she read the financial   pages of the newspaper to her rich father. Her father died when Hetty was 30, and she inherited 1 million. When she herself died in 1916, she left almost 100 million to her two children. Hetty made her money on the New York stock   exchange. She was a financial genius. She made money so easily that people called her the Witch of Wall Street. But although she was one of the richest women in the world, she counted every cent and spent as little as possible. She didn't own a house, because she didn't want to pay taxes. So she and her children lived in cheap hotels. She spent almost nothing on clothes, and always wore the same long black dress. She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank. Hetty's family paid the price for her meanness. When she was 33 she married a millionaire, Edward Green, and they had two children. But Green lost all his money, so she left him. When her son, Ned, injured his knee, Hetty didn't want to pay for a doctor, so she took him to a free hospital for poor people. Unfortunately the doctor knew Hetty was rich and he asked for money. Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it. But eventually Ned got his revenge  . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died. So Hetty's meanness finally killed her. Ned inherited half his mother's fortune, and he spent it all on parties, holidays and expensive jewellery. Question: Why was Hetty Robinson called the Witch of Wall Street? Options: A: She turned out to be the richest woman in New York. B: She liked wearing the same long black dress every day. C: She was fond of reading financial pages of the newspaper. D: She made a large amount of money easily through stocks and shares.

A collection of humorous cartoons depicting a World War Two soldier’s experiences of war have been unearthed following his death. Weston Emmart recorded his time in the Second World War by sketching amusing pictures and writing witty captions which he sent back home to his family to stop them from worrying about him. The pencil drawings depict the late American war veteran struggling with seasickness on the troop ship to the UK and coming to grips with the English weather, traffic and coffee. Heading to England: One of the sketches by late American war veteran Weston Emmart which depicts him getting on the boat to come to the UK. Sea sickness: The artist reveals how he struggled on the journey across the Atlantic. Blackout: The moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944 - all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes. There is a series of spoof sketches showing the soldier cowering from an incoming shell only to be struck by it on the bottom. Other drawings show him being brutally treated by a nurse armed with an oversized needle in hospital while he was recovering from being shot in the leg. Weston died in March this year at the age of 90. His family has since unearthed his old art work and have made it public for the first time. His grandson Alex, 34 said: 'The drawings were all created during the war at different points. Artist: Weston Emmart served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner. Bombs away: One of the early images in a series of spoof sketches which depict Mr Emmart being shot at. Take cover: Mr Emmart sticks his fingers in his ears as he prepares for the bomb to land following its launch. Direct hit: Unfortunately Mr Emmart suffers the full force of the attack. 'Medic!' Mr Emmart requires attention from the medics after the bomb strikes him on the backside. Emergency operation: While Mr Emmart is left dazed and confused, a doctor attempts to remove the bomb. 'He covered his training, being shipped off to England, his reaction to English life and culture and then the cartoon of the soldier getting shot, which is self explanatory. 'My grandfather was a talented artist but was always too humble to promote himself or show off these drawings. 'Since he passed away, my uncle and I have been trying to get his work out there for the world to see.' One of the drawings that Mr Emmart sent back to his family was of the moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944. Due to the darkness, all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes. Alongside. the image, he wrote of disembarking from the crowded troop ship but had. to leave a blank space for the location for security reasons. He filled. in the word ‘Liverpool’ when he returned home from war. Sleeping conditions: Mr Emmart humorously depicts the cramped conditions on the boat. The English weather: The artist reveals how he was forced to come to terms with conditions in England. 'English coffee': Mr Emmart also had to get used to the coffee served up in England. Veteran: Mr Emmart died in March this year at the age of 90. Mr Emmart, from Baltimore, US, served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner. He and two comrades hid from the enemy soldiers beneath a train at Saarbrucken station in southern Germany for two days until they were rescued. His grandson said: 'He told me that his. company was advancing through Saarbrucken when they came under heavy. fire from a German machine gunner. 'He told me that he could see the. advancing bullets striking the gravel, slowly advancing closer and. closer to his position. The next thing he knew, he felt immense pain in. his ankles and dropped to the ground. The reality: File photo showing American troops of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division at Utah Beach, in northern France, on June 9, 1944. Patrol: American troops pass through the streets of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, in Normandy, keeping a sharp lookout for German snipers on June 14, 1944. 'The two other men he was with also went down, sustaining wounds to their knees and thighs. 'My grandfather and the two other men crawled under a stationary train on the tracks as their company was pushed back by the Germans. They waited for two days under that train until another company of Americans advanced on their position. 'When the medic was attending to my grandfather, he cut off his socks and out fell the bullet that penetrated his ankles. We still have the bullet to this day.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a collection of funny cartoons made by Weston Emmart, a World War Two soldier.

Answer the following question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ).

Article: Tragedy struck for brothers Rob and Paul Forkan when they lost their parents in the 2004 Asian tsunami. Now, over ten years later, they're using their flip flop business to help other orphans. The boys had an unusual childhood. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India. Their parents were of the philosophy that they would receive a healthier and fuller education by traveling the world and helping others. There they did lots of voluntary work and mixed with the local community. It was when the family were on holiday in Sri Lanka that the tsunami hit. Although the children managed to escape, their parents tragically couldn't. But Paul says their upbringing meant they were able to cope with this tough blow. \\"Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve,\\" says Paul. What the boys did was to start a business selling ethically-sourced sandals. They're called 'Gandys' after the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi. \\"He was in all our schoolbooks as kids; he's on all the money over in India;  he's famous for wearing his flip flops,\\" says Paul. The entire project was inspired by their parents' philosophy, their globetrotting childhoods and what happened to them in Sri Lanka. Their parents had previously worked in the fashion industry before quitting their jobs and focusing on humanitarian projects. Thus, Gandys is a very fitting tribute to their lives. Gandys sells flip-flops and donates 10 percent of the profits from every pair sold to orphans around the globe. In conjunction with Gandys, the Forkans also founded Orphans for Orphans, a charitable organization dedicated to helping orphans. They say they can make a profit and do good at the same time: they give 10% of their profit to charity, and have set up their own foundation through which they've been able to open a children's home in Sri Lanka. This year alone, Gandys has sold 250,000 pairs of flip... Question: The two brothers left the UK for India because   _  .

Does the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" answer the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" Options are:  (a). yes;  (b). no;","output":"(a). Yes, the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" answers the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" by providing the necessary information about the event's occurrence in the year 1975. The Apollo-Soyuz mission, also known as the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), was a historic joint space mission between the United States and the Soviet Union. This mission marked the first time that spacecraft from the two competing superpowers in the Cold War met and docked in space, signifying the easing of tensions and the beginning of international cooperation in space exploration. The primary goal of the Apollo-Soyuz mission was to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking systems to facilitate future international space missions between the two nations. This was achieved by having the American Apollo spacecraft and the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft dock with each other, allowing astronauts and cosmonauts to visit each other's spacecraft, share meals, and conduct joint scientific experiments. It demonstrated that nations with different spacecraft and technology could work together for the greater good of humanity. The mission also showcased various scientific experiments and investigations in fields such as biology, astronomy, and meteorology, which were conducted jointly by the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts on board their respective spacecraft. Following the successful docking and collaboration during the Apollo-Soyuz mission, many additional collaborations between the United States and other nations (including Russia, successor to the Soviet Union) have taken place in the realm of space exploration. The most enduring example of this cooperation is the International Space Station (ISS), which is managed and operated by space agencies from several nations. In summary, the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" effectively answers the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" by pinpointing the year of the mission's flight, thus providing the necessary information for those interested in this pioneering collaborative space effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter Movie plot: When his village is plagued by mysterious deaths marked by highly accelerated aging, Dr. Marcus calls in his army friend, Captain Kronos. Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips. At a tavern, Kronos defeats thugs led by Kerro, who were hired by Lady Durward's coachman to murder him. Kronos, Grost, Marcus and Carla set up a network of alarm bells in the woods to announce the passage of vampires. Meanwhile, a large bat attacks and kills a young woman. Marcus realises that he has become a vampire and begs Kronos to kill him. After various methods (including impalement with a stake and hanging) fail, Kronos accidentally pierces Marcus's chest with a cross of steel that Marcus had been wearing round his neck.

Q: who was secretary of state when china was lost? A:","output":"A: The term \\"China was lost\\" generally refers to the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party under Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949. At that time, the United States Secretary of State was Dean Acheson. Dean Acheson (1893 – 1971) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman from January 21, 1949, to January 20, 1953. Acheson played a pivotal role in the development of American foreign policy during the early years of the Cold War. His tenure witnessed a series of significant events, including the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the outbreak of the Korean War, and the aforementioned Communist takeover in China. The \\"loss of China\\" was viewed as a major geopolitical setback for the United States and its allies, as it increased the influence of communism in Asia. It sparked a political controversy in the United States, as critics, especially Republican politicians, accused the Truman administration and the State Department of \\"losing China\\" due to policy failures, insufficient support for the Chinese Nationalists, and a lack of effort in combating communism in China. Acheson, as the Secretary of State at that time, became a key target of criticism. However, the reasons behind the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War were complex and multifaceted, involving historical, political, social, and economic factors. It has been argued that both American policy and the actions of the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek also contributed to the eventual outcome. Dean Acheson remained a steadfast advocate of the containment policy, aiming to limit the spread of communism globally. In the wake of the loss of China, he advocated for the defense of Japan, Korea, and other strategic locations in East Asia. Despite the criticisms levied against him and the Truman administration, Acheson continued to play a crucial role in shaping American foreign policy during one of the most decisive moments of the Cold War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The Very Reverend Martin Thrower, 56, rector of Hadleigh, Suffolk, held his mobile phone over the top of a toilet cubicle, Norwich Crown Court heard. Thrower was arrested at a shopping centre in Ipswich in August 2016. He admitted two counts of voyeurism at a previous hearing and his sentence was suspended for 24 months. Thrower was ordered to complete a 60-day course to address sex offending behaviour, and must attend a further 30-day rehabilitation course. William Carter, prosecuting, said the rector was caught when a 17-year-old heard a noise above him as he sat on the toilet at the Buttermarket shopping centre. The teenager saw someone's hand holding a mobile phone that was filming him over the cubicle partition. He grabbed the phone and Thrower was arrested. Passing sentence earlier, judge Katharine Moore told Thrower he had been \\"well-regarded\\" by those he had helped, adding he had been a listening ear \\"in times of great sadness and some in happier times\\". She told him: \\"It seems to me that there has been a tendency throughout to attribute this persistent behaviour over a two-year period to a breakdown in your mental health. \\"I accept without reservation that you were working very hard. \\"I do not accept that your actions here though were anything other than an exercise of free choice repeated again and again when you thought you could get away with it in public lavatories.\\" When Thrower was arrested, officers found three further videos recorded on the phone that day, including of two men who had not noticed they were being filmed. Thrower, of Church Street, Hadleigh, Suffolk, is rector of Hadleigh, Layham and Shelley. He has been suspended from all roles by the Diocese of St Edmundsbury in Ipswich. Stephen Nelson, mitigating, said Thrower was of previous good character and \\"deeply remorseful\\".

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In choosing a friend, one should be very careful. A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Part of being self-reliant is undertaking certain responsibilities that enable people to experience independence.  Doing simple things such as paying your bills on time, cleaning up after yourself if you make a mess, and going to work or school on time can help you feel more responsible and self-reliant. If you do not have a job, you have the responsibility of looking for a job, seeking education that will lead to employment, or starting your own business. Information is power, so having information will give you the power to make your own decisions and assert your independence.  Try to be well-rounded and keep up with information about what is going on in your place of business or school, your town, your state, your country, and the world. For example, knowing that a local ordinance determining whether backyard chickens can be kept in your area is coming up for a vote can give you the opportunity to lobby and vote for the ability to keep chickens for fresh eggs. You should have a sense of direction.  Something has to drive you.  For example, if you are attending college, you should at least have an idea of what you want to do after college and what you are passionate about studying.  You should also try to set goals for yourself.  Try setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, then be realistic about what you need to do to meet those goals.  Seek out a career counselor if you are not sure what you’d like to do with your life.  Career self-assessments can be found online. Many websites like this one or this one can offer helpful guidance. Most schools have career centers or guidance counselors available to all enrolled students.  These resources can help you shape a vision for your future. Allowing people to make your decisions for you is essentially giving up your independence and self-reliance.  Assert yourself and make decisions for yourself based on your goals and dreams.  While it is important to be considerate towards other people, it is not necessary to give up your ability to make your own decisions.  For example, if you are looking for a place to live with a roommate, be sure you are making decisions based on what is best for you.  If you prefer to rent a house and have a bit more independence than an apartment building, stick to your preference and do not allow your roommate to talk you into something that you don’t want to do. It can also be common for some people to allow their spouses or significant others to make all the decisions in their relationship, from where to go out to eat to where to live and what kind of car to buy.  Changing the dynamic of such a relationship may strain the relationship, but having a part in the decision making at both daily and long-term levels can give you greater control of your life.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility, staying informed, having a sense of direction, setting goals, and making decisions for oneself to achieve self-reliance and independence in various areas of one's life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often). After the end of the story, Nagoski probably: - doesn't write anymore books - ignores people's questions on the book - not enough information - answers questions about her book The answer is:","output":"After the end of the story, it is most likely that Dr. Emily Nagoski continues to engage with her audience and addresses questions about her book, \\"Come As You Are.\\" As a respected expert in the field of human sexuality with a Ph.D., she is likely to be open to discussing her work, providing additional insights, and potentially even writing more books or articles on related topics.

Lucy Stone (August 13, 1818 - October 18, 1893) was a prominent U.S. orator, abolitionist, and suffragist, and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women. In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking. Stone was known for using her birth name after marriage, the custom at the time being for women to take their husband's surname. In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.  Starting early in January, 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone repeatedly at Pope's Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying \\"Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement.\\" Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920.  Catt, Stone and Blackwell went together to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the \\"triumvirate\\" of women's suffrage, were called away from the convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen \\"I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes...\\" Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self\\". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Once President what was Stanton views etc?","output":"The text provided does not explicitly mention Stanton's views after becoming president. However, it does mention that Stanton gave a brilliant speech, which was published in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self.\\" This suggests that her views and ideas can be found within that speech."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic (Francesco Carnelutti) is found dead, cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is contacted by top-brass Cardinal Driscoll (Peter Weller) who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic's death. Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims (Shannyn Sossamon) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett (Mark Addy) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor's death, as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a 'Sin Eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church wasn't happy about his activities. Alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes... Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co-production was written, produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if I'm honest & I usually am, honest that is. Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it's throughly predictable, excruciatingly dull & boring, really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously. The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things. There's the usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, belief, prophecy's, blah, blah, blah you know the sort of thing. Then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming, there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen, corruption, greed, evil, etc. you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church. The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks, a lot. I'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to, as a die-hard horror fan I didn't see much horror in this at all, as a thriller it's less than thrilling, as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of Sesame Street (1969 - present), harsh maybe but it's what I think... Director Helgeland does an OK job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab, grayish & dull. For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements, in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, don't ask. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable. According the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now. I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good. The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable. The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates, a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this. The Order, I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much, misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it! Not recommended.","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer criticizes the script, story, themes, twists, direction, horror elements, special effects, and acting.

Answer the following question: Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sister did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly?  Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Answer:","output":"Answer: Ann Step 1: Identify the question The question asks which sister did not have a disease related to incorrect production of hemoglobin. Step 2: Extract information from the given text The text states that Mary has sickle cell anemia and Ann is normal. Step 3: Determine the sickle cell anemia status According to the hint, sickle cell anemia is a disease where hemoglobin is produced incorrectly, leading to misshapen red blood cells. A person who is homozygous recessive (ss) will have this disease, while a person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will not. Step 4: Identify the sister without the disease Since Mary has sickle cell anemia, she has the disease related to incorrect hemoglobin production. On the other hand, Ann, who is normal, does not have this disease. Conclusion: Ann is the sister who does not have the disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the word \\"fatigue\\" mean the same thing in \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue.\\" and \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue.\\"?","output":"Yes, the word \\"fatigue\\" carries a similar meaning in the two sentences, \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue.\\" and \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue,\\" although the contexts differ. In both scenarios, the word \\"fatigue\\" refers to a state of tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion caused by a specific activity or circumstance. However, the causative factors and the way fatigue manifests in each sentence differ.  In the sentence, \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue,\\" the term \\"museum fatigue\\" refers to a phenomenon where an individual becomes overwhelmed, tired, or mentally exhausted after spending excessive time visiting a museum, taking in a vast amount of information, and viewing numerous art exhibits or artifacts. It occurs because the brain finds it challenging to process a large amount of new information continuously and to pay attention to every exhibit without any breaks or pauses. This type of fatigue is more related to cognitive overload and the physical tiredness of walking through a large museum. On the other hand, in the sentence, \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue,\\" the term \\"scandal fatigue\\" describes the weariness and emotional exhaustion of the public as they become increasingly disinterested in numerous scandals, especially related to politics, celebrities, or businesses. This phenomenon occurs when people feel bombarded with continuous news stories or revelations of scandals, leading them to become desensitized or indifferent to any new scandal news that emerges. While \\"fatigue\\" in both instances denotes a state of exhaustion, it is crucial to understand that the context determines its manifestation: 1. Museum fatigue: It is a combination of mental and physical exhaustion that results from consuming too much information while visiting a museum. 2. Scandal fatigue: It is emotional exhaustion caused by the overexposure to recurring scandalous news or events, leading to disinterest and desensitization. In summary, the word \\"fatigue\\" signifies a state of tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion in both sentences. However, the type of fatigue - such as cognitive, physical, or emotional - largely depends on the context in which it is being used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Purple Heart awarded to a soldier who was killed in Vietnam in 1966 will be returned to his family on Tuesday - two decades after it vanished and turned up in an elementary school playground. Private First Class Thomas McGraw was awarded the Purple Heart after his death in an ambush in Vietnam on February 1, 1966, while serving in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. He was just 19. His daughter, Robyn DeCuffa, was just a toddler when he died, and when she turned 18, her mother gave her McGraw's Army medals, the flag that had covered his coffin and a photo album from his military service. 'The medal was really all that I did have from my father,' said DeCuffa, now a 51-year-old mother of eight from Cortland in central New York. But years later, the Purple Heart disappeared while she was living outside Syracuse, where her father grew up. She said someone likely stole the medal, but she wouldn't elaborate. 'It was a part of him I could physically hang on to,' she said. 'It was devastating when it was missing.' Then somehow, in the early 1990s, the Purple Heart was found by Jason Galloway on the playground at his Syracuse elementary school. He handed it in to the front office. Although McGraw's name was engraved on the back, apparently no effort was made to return it to its owner. When school ended for the year, the medal was given back to Jason, who brought it home. Karen Galloway, Jason's mother, said the medal mostly sat in a drawer in the kitchen of her family's home in Liverpool. Every now and then, her husband would search the Internet in an effort to locate McGraw and return the medal, but had no luck finding any information. 'We didn't put tons and tons of effort into it,' she said. Then, last Christmas, the now 34-year-old Jason was visiting from Virginia when his wife saw the medal and asked why the family had it since Jason, an Air Force veteran, hadn't been wounded. Reunited: McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, pictured left, will receive the medal on Tuesday. It was found by Jason Galloway, pictured right, when he was a boy but his family were unable to find its owners. When she learned how it had been found, Jason's wife said it would be 'cool' to find its owner. Weeks later, she called her mother-in-law to say she had seen a local news story on Purple Hearts Reunited, a Vermont-based organization that returns lost or stolen military medals to veterans or their families. Karen Galloway contacted the founder, Zachariah Fike, who traced the medal's origins and located DeCuffa, a manager for Capital Region Off-Track Betting, and her mother Sarah Dallas, who lives in Mexico, New York. 'It almost feels like a miracle that this is being returned,' said DeCuffa, whose second-oldest son is an Army veteran and whose second-oldest daughter is in the Air Force. Award: The medal (file picture) will be returned during a ceremony outside Syracuse, New York on Tuesday. Fike will return the medal to DeCuffa and Dallas during a ceremony being held at the Cavalry Club, a former National Guard camp-turned-golf club in Manlius, outside Syracuse. She plans to display the award in the center of her living room. More than 150 people are expected to attend, including Dallas, the soldier's widow, as well as Galloway and her husband. 'I'm so excited about it,' Galloway said. 'He lost his life and I think that it's really important that it gets back to his family.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. A Purple Heart awarded to soldier Thomas McGraw, who was killed in Vietnam in 1966, will be returned to his family decades after it was lost. 2.

In the early 1990s, Jason Galloway found the Purple Heart on the playground of his Syracuse elementary school and handed it in but the medal was eventually returned to him as efforts to find the owner were unsuccessful at the time. 4.

Mr McGuinness referred to dissident republicans as\\" traitors to the island of Ireland\\" after the 2009 murder of a police constable. Stephen Carroll was gunned down by the Real IRA  in Lurgan in March 2009. He was the first police officer in Northern Ireland to be killed since the formation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001. Following the murder, Sir Hugh had discussed the idea of First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness holding a press conference. Mr McGuinness had said the chief constable should address the press as well. \\"I went out and briefed the press and then Martin came up with that statement which had I not been so tired, I think I would have fallen over,\\" Sir Hugh told BBC Talkback. \\"He was clearly very angry and he clearly saw that the violent struggle had ended and the political way forward was the right way and that these people had nothing to do with modern republicanism and political influence and democracy.\\" Sir Hugh described his relationship with Mr McGuinness as \\"professional\\" but admitted they attended the same events several times without speaking. \\"When I took over in 2002, Sinn Féin had not even joined policing... they wouldn't join policing,\\" he said. \\"I had stood opposite him in the White House during a St Patrick's Day event and they (republicans) would not speak to me. \\"I remember on one occasion, probably 2003 when they (Sinn Féin) hadn't joined policing. \\"Desmond Rea, the chair of the police board walked across the floor to say hello and they wouldn't acknowledge me at that point,\\" he said. \\"The world moved on hugely from there.\\" He said a face-to-face meeting did eventually happen. \\"The first time I think was probably at No 10 (Downing Street) when I was asked to go and meet the (Sinn Féin) leadership,\\" he said. \\"It was a courteous meeting. I talked about policing, they talked about demilitarisation. \\"The point was the meeting had taken place and we moved on from there.\\" During his time as chief constable, Sir Hugh was responsible for overseeing the reform of policing in Northern Ireland and winning the support of Catholics and Irish nationalists in the wake of 1998's Good Friday Agreement. The PSNI replaced the Royal Ulster Constabulary in November 2001 following recommendations contained in the Patton Report on policing. The Patten recommendations aimed to make the police service more welcoming to the Catholic community and more representative of Northern Ireland. Sir Hugh said that over time, Mr McGuinness \\"became persuaded it was the right thing to do\\" for Sinn Féin to support policing. \\"The officers on the ground persuaded the communities we were protecting them and being effective and he then engaged with us in a very professional and indeed positive way,\\" he said. \\"I met him many times and it was extraordinary as chief constable briefing the first minister and deputy first minister on policing and security issues mindful of his background.\\" The former chief constable said he always found Mr McGuiness easy to deal with. \\"History will judge him fairly and therefore will remind those who are interested of his violent past and his transition from that violent past through the peace process to a highly effective politician,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, many senior civil servants told me what an effective minister he was. He knew how to work within government. \\"He was a man of stature in his later years but I think they will provide a fair and balanced view.\\" Martin McGuinness died early on Tuesday in a Londonderry hospital with his family by his side.

Article: It's interesting to see how people make use of the time they spend on public transport in Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai. In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train. Now, wouldn't it be perfect if we had a public transport worth the name in all our cities? Question: If you see people in colourful clothing and breathing heavily, you are probably travelling during the   _  .

Question: What was the third alcoholic beverage listed Context: In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choices: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(2). Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other as both are seeking ways to improve the downloading speed of Jio. In order to increase Jio downloading speed, you can try several methods and settings. Before we dive into them, it's crucial to note that the results may vary based on your Jio network coverage, device performance, and network congestion. Here are some steps you can follow: 1. Check your data balance: Insufficient data balance or crossing daily data limit can result in reduced speed. Please ensure that you have enough data balance by checking it on the MyJio app. 2. Testing your speed: The first step to improve your Jio internet speed is to test your current connection speed by using popular speed testing websites like Speedtest.net or Fast.com. Comparing your current speed with your advertised plan will give you a better understanding of whether you are getting the appropriate internet speed or not. 3. Network selection: Sometimes, your device may switch between 4G and other networks, causing fluctuations in your internet speed. The best way to address this is by selecting the preferred network. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Preferred Network Type > Choose \\"4G (LTE) only\\" or \\"4G/3G/2G (Auto Connect)\\". 4. APN settings: You can try changing your Access Point Names (APN) settings. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Advanced > Access Point Names (APN). Create a new APN with the following settings:   * Name: Jio High Speed   * APN: jionet   * Proxy: (Leave blank)   * Port: (Leave blank)   * Username: (Leave blank)   * Password: (Leave blank)   * Server: www.google.com   * MMSC: (Leave blank)   * MMS Proxy: (Leave blank)   * MMS Port: (Leave blank)   * MCC: 405   * MNC: 857 or 863 or 874   * Authentication type: None   * APN Protocol: IPv4/IPv6   * Bearer: LTE   * APN roaming protocol: IPv4   Once done, save the new APN settings and set it as the default APN. 5. Clear cache: To enhance the performance of your device and reduce the load on the processor, it's a good idea to regularly clear cache and browsing history. 6. Update apps: Update your apps and device software to the latest version available. Older versions of apps may not work efficiently with your device's hardware and consume more data, resulting in slow speeds. 7. Use a download manager: Using a download manager app, like IDM, can help improve your downloading speed by breaking files into smaller parts and downloading them concurrently. This method is more efficient than downloading files sequentially. 8. Change location: If you are experiencing slow internet speed due to poor network coverage, try moving to a different area with better network signals. 9. Monitor background app usage: Disable auto-updates and background sync of apps that consume data extensively in the background. These activities can impact your overall downloading speed. 10. Contact customer support: If, after trying all these methods, your Jio downloading speed is still slow, you can contact Jio's customer support to register a complaint or get more information on what may be causing the issue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aim for at least 20-30 minutes per day for quick and steady progress. 8. Practice writing skills: Writing can help boost overall language proficiency. Keep a journal in German, participate in online language forums, or simply write emails to your language partner to improve your writing skills. 9. Learn through different methods: Different learning techniques appeal to different people. Experiment with various methods, such as flashcards, textbooks, language games, or structured lessons, to discover what works best for you. 10. Be patient and stay motivated: Learning a language takes time and commitment. Don't worry about making mistakes; they're a natural part of the process. Stay positive and remind yourself of the reasons for learning German.

Premise: - A casually dressed man - Gazes confused - Pile of ingredients - Kitchen counter Hypothesis: - Person (not specifically man or woman) - Looking - Pile of groceries Step 2: Compare the elements of the premise and hypothesis to see if they align. 1. \\"A casually dressed man\\" in the premise aligns with the \\"person\\" in the hypothesis, since a man is a person. The clothing description is not relevant to the hypothesis. 2. \\"Gazes confused\\" in the premise aligns with \\"looking\\" in the hypothesis, since gazing is a form of looking. The emotional state of confusion is not relevant to the hypothesis. 3. \\"Pile of ingredients\\" in the premise is similar to \\"pile of groceries\\" in the hypothesis, as ingredients can be considered a subset of groceries or items found in a grocery store. While not an exact match, these concepts are related. 4. The location of the event in the premise is on a kitchen counter, which, while not mentioned in the hypothesis, does not detract from its accuracy.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. What did the waitress have to eat on her date?

Write an article based on this summary: People who watch BBC programmes only on iPlayer will be required to buy a TV licence to view the content from 1 September.","output":"Title: Mandatory TV Licence for BBC iPlayer Viewers Coming into Effect from September 1 Introduction As of 1 September, viewers of BBC programmes, who solely use iPlayer to watch their favourite shows, will be required to purchase a TV licence to access content on the platform. This change has been implemented to ensure that all audiences contribute fairly to the cost of the UK's public service broadcaster, reflecting the growing use of iPlayer. Reason for the change in TV licence policy In recent years, the way people consume content has shifted significantly, with more individuals relying on online platforms like iPlayer to watch TV programmes. This has led the UK government to amend the legislation, requiring the purchase of a TV licence for those who only watch content online. The ultimate goal is to ensure that those who benefit from the BBC's programming share the financial burden of supporting the broadcaster. Cost and impact of a TV licence The current cost of a TV licence is £159 per year, which fund the public service broadcaster's operations. Until now, users who exclusively watch content on iPlayer were not required to obtain a licence. However, with these new changes, it is estimated that approximately two million more viewers will be required to pay the fee. Penalties for not holding a valid TV licence Viewers who fail to purchase a TV licence while watching content on BBC iPlayer may face penalties. These penalties can range from receiving a warning letter to being fined up to £1,000. To avoid any legal consequences, users are encouraged to check the updated regulations and acquire a TV licence when necessary. How to obtain a TV licence To secure a TV licence, viewers can visit the official website (tvlicensing.co.uk) and follow the step-by-step process. Payment can be made in one lump sum or divided into monthly or quarterly instalments. Additionally, discounts are available for individuals aged over 75 or those with certain disabilities. Conclusion The new requirement for BBC iPlayer viewers to obtain a TV licence marks a significant change in the way people contribute to the UK's public service broadcaster. The measure aims to ensure that all audiences who enjoy BBC content contribute fairly to funding its operations. As online platforms continue to grow in popularity, it is essential that the financial support for the broadcaster remains consistent, allowing the BBC to deliver its much-loved programming to audiences for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This particular note was introduced as a new denomination following the demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, aimed at combating corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. This note is part of the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series and has several distinct features for identification and security purposes: 1. Size: The ₹2000 note measures 166 x 66 mm, making it slightly larger than smaller denomination notes and aiding in the easy identification. 2. Design elements: It features a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on the front side and the motif of Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) on the reverse, symbolizing India's scientific and technological advancements. The denomination numeral '2000' is written in Devanagari script. 3. Colour scheme: As mentioned earlier, the note has a magenta base colour along with additional colours for intricate patterns and designs. 4. Security features: Multiple security features are in place to ensure the prevention of counterfeiting. These include a see-through register with the denomination numeral (2000), latent images, and a color-shifting security thread, which changes colour from green to blue when the note is tilted. Additionally, a microprinted numeral (2000), a numeral panel with numerals in ascending font size, intaglio printing, and a watermark of Mahatma Gandhi's portrait are present as well. For visually impaired individuals, there are raised printing elements, such as the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, Ashoka Pillar emblem, and bleed lines.

What once was an idyllic haven for many residents is now the center of a heated and controversial debate that is shaking the very core of the town. The uproar began with a local faith group's plan to construct a mosque and community center on a piece of land that was formerly a public park. This religious congregation's goal was simple: to create a space where members could worship, socialize, and engage in community services. For some residents, the proposal was seen as an opportunity to embrace diversity and promote understanding among different cultures and belief systems. However, for others, it has revealed deep-seated fears and prejudices that stand between the town's serene calm and a future that fosters inclusion. Opponents of the mosque have cited concerns about traffic congestion, noise, and a potential decline in property values as reasons to halt the project. These concerns, while valid, have not always been expressed respectfully. Some opponents have used derogatory language or made baseless accusations that veer dangerously into the realm of bigotry. Meanwhile, supporters of the mosque have accused the opposition of intolerance, xenophobia, and discrimination. This unfortunate circumstance is creating rifts among neighbors and friends as lines are drawn and viewpoints clash. Despite the controversy, local government officials have started to evaluate the proposal meticulously, following all necessary legal and regulatory channels. They must consider all aspects of the proposed mosque, along with the potential impact on town resources, land use, and public safety. Impartiality and fairness must guide their decision-making, keeping in mind the values of freedom of religion and the right to gather for worship. As this suburban Chicago community continues to grapple with the prospect of a mosque in their neighborhood, one thing remains certain - this situation has exposed cracks in the façade of unity and acceptance that the town may have once taken for granted. It is now up to the residents, community leaders, and elected officials to navigate this delicate situation, striving for a resolution that fosters harmony, promotes understanding, and upholds the core values that bind us all together. The future of the suburb now hangs in the balance, as its people seek the path to healing and togetherness while facing the challenge of change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She leaves, and he submerges in his bath water for a moment. Only then is there music as background to his shaving the moustache and thoroughly washing it down the drain. Later, there is a ring, and he starts for the door. She comes in asking \\"why didn't you let me in?\\". He waits in vain for her to notice his clean lip. Instead, she says he hasn't commented on her \\"tarty look\\". They drive to their friends Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and Nadia's (Macha Polikarpova) house, and he says to go in while he parks. Even Serge's little girl doesn't notice the missing moustache.Marc overhears Serge call Agnes two-faced, and insists on hearing the story. About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar. On their drive home, Marc says \\"the joke has gone far enough\\", her pretending not to notice he shaved the moustache.

Summarize: Check all product labels for safety instructions before you begin. Gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear are all recommended. If you have single cracks less than ¼\\" (6mm) wide, use asphalt crack filler. Check the label for application instructions or apply as follows:  Shake the bottle to mix the product evenly. Cut off the top of the nozzle so the opening is narrower than the crack. (If there is no nozzle, load the product into an asphalt caulk gun instead.) Squeeze the filler directly into the crack until it is flush with the driveway. Let dry for 24 hours. If the filler has sunk below the driveway surface level, apply an additional coat. Wait at least 24 hours after the final coat before walking or driving over the repair. This material is intended for \\"alligator scale\\" or \\"spiderweb\\" crack patterns, single cracks wider than ¼\\" (6mm), and small depressions shallower than 2\\" (5cm). If the alligator cracks are severe, chunks of the asphalt may be fully separated from the driveway. You may achieve a stronger repair if you remove these entirely, then refill the hole using the pothole method above. Pour a little of the material onto the center of the damage. Spread it out with an asphalt squeegee (or an asphalt brush) until the damage is covered with ⅛ to ¼\\" (3 to 6 mm) of material. Check the label instructions first. Some products may need to be mixed in a bucket before application. Spread on additional alligator patching material until the cracked area or depression is level with its surroundings. For a more even transition, squeegee out a thin layer one or two feet (0.3 to 0.6m) in each direction. The material will harden over the course of a few hours, depending on climate and depth of the repair. Thick repairs may crack slightly over the course of a few days. Apply an additional thin coat if this happens.","output":"Before starting, check product labels for safety instructions and wear gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear.

The three visit princess Mombi in hopes of getting more information, but she is working with the Nome King and imprisons them. Dorothy, Billina, and Tik-Tok meet Jack Pumpkinhead, who explains he was brought to life via Mombi's Powder of Life. Dorothy uses the Powder of Life to vivify the Gump, the head of a moose-like animal whose body they put together using two sofas, palm leaves, a broom, and rope. Using the Gump as transport, the group escapes and flies across the Deadly Desert to reach the Nome King's mountain. In his underground domain, the Nome King tells Dorothy that the Scarecrow stole the emeralds from him to build the Emerald City, and should be punished. He does not listen when Dorothy protests that the emeralds preceded the Scarecrow at the city.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.  - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies.  - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g (  operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) =  beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) +  cdots + f_m ( x_m ) .  ,  ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability .  - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.  - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.  - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.  - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others.  - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization.  - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates.  - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice.  - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data.  - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.  - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity.  - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.    What is the relationship between 'generalized additive model' and 'statistical model'? A:","output":"The relationship between a generalized additive model (GAM) and a statistical model lies in the fact that a GAM is a specific type of statistical model. In other words, the generalized additive model is a subcategory within the broader range of statistical models. A statistical model is a class of mathematical models that represents a set of assumptions concerning the generation of sample data from a larger population. It captures the data-generating process in an idealized form to enable statistical inferences, predictions, and descriptions of the relationships between variables. A generalized additive model (GAM), on the other hand, is a specific kind of statistical model that blends properties of generalized linear models with additive models. In a GAM, the linear predictor depends on unknown smooth functions of predictor variables. It allows for more flexible and non-parametric relationships between the response and predictor variables, which can potentially lead to better fits to data than purely parametric models. This flexibility comes at the cost of some interpretability. In summary, the relationship between a GAM and a statistical model is that the GAM falls under the broader category of statistical models, where it represents a specific type of model that allows more flexibility in capturing relationships between variables."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The system, called Driver Alert, aims to reduce deadly road accidents by 20% - 40% that are caused by tiredness. Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible. The device has been delivered to the department's laboratories for testing.

Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Schools have been blamed for giving kids access to soda in vending machines  . But new data suggest that school soft drink sales may not be an important factor in how much soda kids drink. In the current issue of The Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, researchers compared soda consumption among nearly 500 students inprefix = st1 /Mainewho attended seven schools over two school years. Four of the schools cut back on soft drink availability at the schools, while three of the schools made no changes. All the students were drinking less soda by the end of the study period, but there were no meaningful differences in overall soft drink consumption among the different schools. The data suggest that limiting soft drink availability at school doesn't result in meaningful changes in drink consumption patterns. While there were no changes in overall soda consumption, there was a notable shift in diet soda drinking among girls. If the school cut back on soda availability, girls were less likely to drink diet soda, compared to girls in schools that made no changes. The data are the latest to suggest that schools may not play as big of a role in kids' poor eating habits as widely believed. Last year, The American Journal of Public Healthpublished a provocative   study showing that childhood weight problems often get worse in the summer, when kids are out of school. Data from kindergarteners and first graders found that body mass index   increased two to three times as fast in summer as during the regular school year. Minority children were especially at risk, as were children who were already overweight. Even children who were too thin and needed to gain weight appeared to have better eating habits during the school year. They actually gained more weight while in school and less in the summer. Even so, much of the focus on childhood nutrition and obesity   remains in the nation's schools.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, we understand that Ned studied about reactions at higher temperatures, while Paul focused on reactions at lower temperatures for their physics class. As the question asks about the person who studied a slower reaction rate, we need to analyze the relationship between temperature and reaction rates. In general, the rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by temperature. Higher temperatures typically cause an increase in the reaction rate. This is due to the fact that higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the reacting particles (atoms or molecules). With this added energy, particles move faster and collide more frequently, thus resulting in an increased probability of successful collisions that lead to the formation of product molecules. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, particles have less kinetic energy, and therefore move more slowly and collide with less frequency and force. This means that the rate of successful collisions that could lead to the formation of the product molecules decreases, resulting in a slower reaction rate overall. Given this understanding of the relationship between temperature and reaction rates, we can deduce that Paul, who studied reactions at lower temperatures, focused on the reactions with slower reaction rates. This is because lower temperatures lead to decreased kinetic energy and slower movement of particles, resulting in a reduced rate of successful collisions between reacting particles and, consequently, a slower rate of chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What is great art? On the one hand, we can all see that great art is old art which is called great. But how do we know which art of our own times is great, and which will be forgotten? And who decides? These are important questions, for the great art of the past often was not considered great during its own time. When Shakespeare and Charles Dickens were writing, for example, most critics considered them as hack   writers with little or no literary ability. Similarly, Van Gogh and many of the other Impressionist painters of the late nineteenth century were not allowed to participate in events involving what were thought to be the \\"real\\" painters of the time, and often they were very poor. Yet today their paintings often sell for millions of dollars, while those so-called \\"real\\" painters are now barely remembered. So what makes great art? Can, for example, rock music be great art? Music videos? Cartoons and comics? Those who call themselves critics of the fine arts often have been the last to recognize great art in the past, and we can probably expect this to be the situation today. Critics often don't recognize great art because they tend to be prejudiced against what is popular. Popular works, whether they are novels, movies, or comics, are usually considered to be produced for the sake of money only, and not for the sake of art. But popularity, it seems to me, is one of the three signs that a present-day work of art may come to be thought of as great. The other two are that it is groundbreaking, and that it is inherently   beautiful. Many works have one or even two of these qualities of being popular, unusual, and beautiful. But having all the three often will mean that a work of art will someday be seen to be great, though it may take a good spoonful of time, such as a century or two, to know for sure. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? Options: A: Critics have changed their attitudes to great works. B: Most of the opinions of critics are valueless. C: The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. D: Works of Impressionist painters will be great one day. The answer is:","output":"C: The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. Step-by-step justification: 1. The article discusses the difficulty of determining which present-day art will be considered great in the future. 2. It provides examples of artists such as Shakespeare, Dickens, and Van Gogh, who were not highly regarded during their time but are now considered great artists. 3. The article suggests that critics often fail to recognize great art, as they tend to dismiss popular works as being produced only for money and not for the sake of art itself. 4. It gives three criteria that may indicate a work of art's potential for future greatness – popularity, being groundbreaking, and inherent beauty. 5. Based on the examples and criteria provided, the article implies that it is the work of art itself, rather than critics' opinions, that ultimately determines its greatness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options：  A. use glass  B. open mouth  C. eat first  D. buy alcohol  E. coffee mug A:","output":"A. Use Glass If you want to drink something politely, the most suitable option among the choices given is to use a glass. The use of a glass showcases good manners, respect towards the host and dining etiquette, especially when in a social or formal situation.  When choosing an appropriate glass, consider the following factors: 1. Type of drink: Different types of glasses are designed specifically for different beverages. For instance, there are wine glasses, beer mugs, whiskey glasses, champagne flutes, and water goblets, among others. Make sure to pick the correct glass for the beverage you are consuming to emphasize politeness and sophistication. 2. Size and shape: The size and shape of a glass may vary depending on its intended use. For example, if you're drinking water, choosing a water goblet or a standard tumbler would be appropriate. Whereas for wine, you should choose between red and white wine glasses, as they have distinct shapes that cater to the different aroma and flavor profiles of the wines. 3. Formality of the event: Different occasions call for different levels of formality. If you're at a casual gathering, a standard tumbler, or a casual wine or beer glass is acceptable. In a more formal setting, however, you may need to choose stemware that complements the tableware and the overall atmosphere of the event. 4. Matching the glassware: If you're in a situation where there is a variety of beverages being served, try to choose a glass that complements the other glass options on the table. This could be as simple as matching the pattern or color of the glassware or choosing a glass of a similar style and size.

If we are discussing a situation or context that relates to Azay-le-Rideau, we can indeed conclude that \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau.\\" However, it's essential to analyze the context in which the term arises and ensure that it is applicable and relevant. The phrase \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau\\" can be interpreted from various perspectives, including geographical, historical, cultural, and architectural standpoints. 1. Geographical context: Azay-le-Rideau is situated in the Loire Valley, which is famous for its numerous magnificent chateaus. The area's landscape is characterized by vineyards and forests and is a popular tourist destination. If the discussion pertains to identifying a location within this region or highlighting spectacular landmarks, we can conclude that \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau.\\"  2. Historical context: The Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, built during the early Renaissance, represents a significant piece of French history. It was constructed under King Francis I's reign in the 16th century, following a complex historical succession of owners and architectural changes. Therefore, if the topic revolves around historical elements linked to this period or notable French chateaus, stating \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau\\" makes sense.  3. Cultural context: Azay-le-Rideau showcases French Renaissance culture, art, and architecture. The chateau is adorned with elaborate sculptures, connecting it to French cultural heritage. Additionally, the surrounding commune hosts various cultural events and boasts traditional French culture, evidenced by local food and wine.

In Great Britain, painted strips on the road to show where pedestrians should cross is named after which animal?","output":"In Great Britain, painted strips on the road to show where pedestrians should cross are named after the animal \\"zebra.\\" This specific type of pedestrian crossing is called a \\"zebra crossing.\\"  Zebra crossings are characterized by their alternating black and white stripes on the road, which resemble the pattern of a zebra's coat. The crossing's design ensures high visibility for both motorists and pedestrians, as it is more easily noticeable than regular crossings. Moreover, at a zebra crossing, pedestrians have priority, and vehicles are required to stop for people waiting to cross or for those already crossing. The origins of the zebra crossing in the UK date back to the early 1940s when several proposals for pedestrian road safety were considered. The zebra crossing was officially introduced in the United Kingdom in 1951, following a period of testing to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing pedestrian accidents on the roads. The name \\"zebra crossing\\" derived from a journalist who, during a discussion on the predecessor of zebra crossings called \\"panda crossings\\" at the Ministry of Transport, suggested to replace pandas with zebras. In addition to the painted stripes, zebra crossings feature several other distinctive elements. For instance, Belisha beacons—globular orange lights mounted on black and white striped poles—are placed on either side of the crossing to alert drivers and enhance the crossing's visibility. These beacons were named after Leslie Hore-Belisha, a British politician and Minister of Transport who implemented them in 1934. Furthermore, there are zigzag lines on the road adjacent to the crossing to indicate that parking, stopping, and overtaking are prohibited in the vicinity. Zebra crossings are one of many crossing types used in the UK and around the world. Some other common variants include pelican crossings, puffin crossings, and toucan crossings, each designed to cater to specific traffic and pedestrian conditions. In summary, the zebra crossing is named after the animal \\"zebra\\" due to the black and white stripes on the road that resembl the pattern of a zebra's coat. This particular crossing format was officially introduced in 1951, and it has been widely used ever since to ensure pedestrian safety across the UK."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria.

Cheese attacked employees on Sunday after complaining about a malfunctioning photo booth, according to police. These two 911 calls detail the chaos. (Parma Police Department) A complaint over a malfunctioning photo booth at an Ohio Chuck E. Cheese’s escalated into a terrifying attack involving a dozen birthday party-goers on Sunday — an incident that left two employees seriously injured, according to police. Police say a female patron complained to Chuck E. Cheese’s employees in Parma, Ohio, about the photo booth not working, and that a manager told her she had to wait. Then, police said, one of the male party attendees followed the manager into the kitchen, threatened to kill him and began to attack. Other employees tried to help their manager, and soon other party attendees joined the fracas and attacked the employees, police say. The brawl, which police say appears to have been one-sided, spilled into the dining room area, where children were present. At least five men from the party are believed to have been directly involved in the attack, with up to a dozen party attendees egging on those fighting. “I’m characterizing this as an attack on the employees of the restaurant by a mob of people,” Parma Police Lt. Kevin Riley told The Post. “There is no evidence at this point to show otherwise. This was an unprovoked attack on a bunch of employees trying to do their job.” Two managers were seriously injured and taken to the hospital but have since been released, according to police. A total of six employees were injured, including one girl under the age of 18 who was struck in the face when she tried to call 911. Those involved in the attack appear to be adults, police said, but they fled the scene before police arrived. Police are planning to release surveillance footage in an effort to track down the attackers, Riley said. “We are anxious to bring these individuals to justice and are actively working with Parma police to provide information that will lead to their arrest,” Chuck E. Cheese’s said in a statement. In one 911 call released by police, a male restaurant employee tells the dispatcher: “I need cops, I need ambulances, I need everything.” “I was standing back here, we had one manager come through being assaulted by a man,” the caller says. “I don’t know the backstory on it. And then the next thing I see several people crowding around the entrance of the kitchen, and I see a large fight breaking out.” A female employee called 911 from the break room, where she told the dispatcher “everybody’s freaking out.” “My managers, both of them, were attacked,” she said. “I don’t know if they had weapons.” Several years ago, The Wall Street Journal published a story about violence at the pizza parlors, reporting: “Chuck E. Cheese’s bills itself as a place ‘where a kid can be a kid.’ But to law-enforcement officials across the country, it has a more particular distinction: the scene of a surprising amount of disorderly conduct and battery among grown-ups.” Fights among guests are an issue for all restaurants, but security experts say they pose a particular problem for Chuck E. Cheese’s, since it is designed to be a haven for children. Law-enforcement officials say alcohol, loud noise, thick crowds and the high emotions of children’s birthday parties make the restaurants more prone to disputes than other family entertainment venues. In a statement following the attack in Ohio, Chuck E. Cheese’s said: “We take any incident in our stores very seriously and have spent more than 15 million to date on measures to help ensure the safety of our guests. With an environment dedicated to serving young children and families, we will not tolerate violence of any kind in our stores. “As a company, the safety of our guests and employees is always a top priority and we will continue to endeavor to the protect the experience families have in our locations so parents are able to trust that their time in Chuck E. Cheese’s will be clean, safe, wholesome family fun.” According to the company, there are more than 580 Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurants around the world.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  and a hint : Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Please answer this question : Which brother was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, Liam, who has high cholesterol, is more at risk for heart disease. The hint explains that cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades and that it plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to restricted blood flow, high blood pressure, a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, and even complete blockages that cause heart attacks. Since Liam has high cholesterol, he is more likely to develop these complications and be at a higher risk for heart disease compared to Rudy, who has his cholesterol and triglycerides within normal parameters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.  Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity?  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Article: George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition  with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics  were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written. Question: What did Gershwin do during his stay in Paris? Options: A: He created one of his best works B: He studied with Nadia Boulanger C: He argued with French critics D: He changed his music style Answer:","output":"A: He created one of his best works Reasoning: During Gershwin's stay in Paris, he wrote \\"An American in Paris,\\" which is mentioned in the article as one of his most famous works.

The article doesn't mention any arguments with French critics or a change in his music style while in Paris, so options C and D are not supported by the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Structurally, the two sentences are highly similar. Both sentences follow a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) format with a woman being the subject, who performs an action on a type of food. However, it is important to look at the actions and the objects to determine their semantic similarity. In the first sentence, the action performed is \\"peeling,\\" while in the second sentence, the action is \\"slicing.\\" Although both of these actions involve cutting or altering the object, they differ from each other. Peeling primarily means removing the skin or outer layer of the object, while slicing refers to cutting it into thin, flat pieces. These differences suggest that the actions described in the sentences are not identical, indicating a lower level of similarity. Next, we will consider the objects of the sentences: a potato in the first one and a tomato in the second one. Both potatoes and tomatoes are commonly used vegetables and share some commonalities in terms of their culinary uses. However, they still have significant differences in taste, texture, and application in various dishes. This distinction further reduces the similarity between the two sentences. Given the structured similarity and the degree of difference in both actions and objects, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 2 (c) on a scale from 0 to 5.

Write a title for this article: FORTUNE — While I was living in Dallas in the late 1980s, researching and writing A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU, I read a memorable essay by a native son, Lawrence Wright, published in Texas Monthly, called “Why Do They Hate Us So Much?” One of the stories Wright tells took place during a family road trip in the summer of 1964, when he was a teenager. Somewhere in Florida, they stopped for gas. The attendant noticed the license plate. “Where from in Texas?” he asked, and when Wright’s father said, “Dallas,” the attendant “stuck his face up to the window to get a closer look at us.” And then he said, “You all killed our president.” “That reaction endured … for years” Wright wrote, “even after Memphis and Los Angeles had their own tragedies. Dallasites always begrudged the fact that those cities were never taken down, the way Dallas was, and made to feel at one with Birmingham and Selma.” At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, they know the feeling. More than a quarter-century has passed since the SMU Mustangs football team received the NCAA’s so-called death penalty for repeated, egregious violations of recruiting rules, yet the story still shocks and amazes. It was the subject of a powerful 2010 film, Pony Excess, that was the highest-rated premiere in ESPN’s Peabody Award winning 30 for 30 documentary series (I appeared on camera) and prompted the reissue of my book this fall by University of Nebraska Press. MORE: Fast cars and furious data No reasonable person disputes that SMU got what it deserved. SMU boosters were paying players; SMU coaches knew all about it; and numerous SMU officials — all the way up to Bill Clements, a two-time Texas governor and chairman of the university’s board — were actively involved. It was an outrageous scandal, and it earned SMU what is still the harshest penalty ever levied against a major college football program: a complete one-year ban on competition, followed by a partial ban in year two. (SMU could have played an away-games-only schedule the second year but chose not to, partly out of fear for the safety of the few undersized players who remained.) Some would argue that paying athletes to perform in contests that are otherwise thoroughly professional shouldn’t be a crime in the first place, and they’d have a point. But there was something profoundly dispiriting and exploitational in the whole sordid SMU affair. Two of the players who were paid the most gained nothing from their association with SMU, and more likely were scarred by it. Offensive lineman Stopperich never played a single down for the Mustangs. He died of a cocaine overdose in 1995 at age 29. Linebacker David Stanley did take the field for the Mustangs, however briefly, but he wound up in drug rehab, paid for — out of compassion, perhaps, or maybe just because Stanley knew too much — by his SMU sugar daddy. After battling substance abuse for years, Stanley died in his sleep in 2005. He was 41. But shouldn’t the dark cloud have dissipated by now, as it has for other bad actors, including some whose transgressions dwarf SMU’s? Southern Cal seems to have recovered. Yes, running back Reggie Bush had to give back the Heisman Trophy he won in 2005 after he and his family were found to have accepted payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars from an agent. And yes, the Trojans forfeited all the games they won that year, and gave up 30 scholarships, but otherwise? USC still plays to big Saturday afternoon crowds at the Coliseum, still wins more games every year than it loses, and last fall (after a two-year bowl ban expired) collected 2 million for playing in the Sun Bowl. USC is still USC. MORE: Old athletes never die. They just move to your iPhone And Penn State? It doesn’t get any worse than what happened at Penn State, where a special investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh found that the head coach, the athletic director and the president of the university knew of allegations against assistant coach Jerry Sandusky involving child sex abuse and failed to take appropriate action. (Sandusky was ultimately convicted on 45 of 48 counts.) Penn State was fined 60 million by the NCAA (the Big Ten Conference tacked on 13 million), forfeited from 1998 through 2011, and lost 60 scholarships and the right to play in a bowl game for four years. Practically speaking, that was a harsher set of sanctions than SMU endured, even if it wasn’t the death penalty. But Penn State still drew an average of more than 100,000 fans to its seven home games last fall, still had a winning season, and still appeared regularly on national TV, where announcers routinely heaped praise on the loyal Nittany Lion players who could have gone elsewhere to finish their college careers but stayed behind to help rebuild a storied program. Penn State is still Penn State. The NCAA’s stated purpose in punishing SMU so severely was to give other potential cheaters something to think about. The theory being, as with the actual death penalty — the one involving lethal injection or an electric chair — that SMU’s example would serve as a general deterrent. It didn’t turn out that way. The dismal parade of recruiting violations, academic fudging, and general bad behavior by athletes, agents, boosters, coaches, and administrators continues unabated. One way SMU might have responded in the wake of the scandal was by scaling back its program, or simply opting out of football altogether. There are precedents for that. The University of Chicago, a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and winner of two national championships in 1905 and 1913, quit playing in 1939 after President Robert Maynard Hutchins decided that the whole bloody spectacle had gotten out of hand. College football, Hutchins wrote, had become an “infernal nuisance,” incompatible with the university’s larger academic mission. Decades later, Chicago did return to the field, but now it competes against colleges like Beloit, Elmhurst, and Rhodes in the NCAA’s Division III, which doesn’t allow athletic scholarships. MORE: Did two guys from Philly just create the best fantasy football platform? A few lonely voices suggested a similar course for SMU, among them, oddly, Governor Clements. Instead, SMU hired Hall of Famer Forrest Gregg as its new coach, with a mandate to bring SMU back from the dead. Gregg promised a fast fix and a return to gridiron glory, but it was not to be. Over the next 20 years, SMU suffered 18 losing seasons, including six when it won just one game, and one, in 2003, when it didn’t win any. SMU’s demise coincided with the breakup of the storied Southwest Conference. The strongest programs, chasing TV-network millions, migrated to the Southeastern Conference and the Big 12. The weakest, SMU among them, bounced from one lesser conference to another and dropped off the big-time college football map. In recent years, however, football has undergone a quiet revival on the SMU campus. Coach June Jones has taken the Mustangs to four straight bowl games, and won three. They play their home games on campus now in Ford Stadium, a tidy, red-brick horseshoe on Mockingbird Lane. This year’s season opener at home against Texas Tech — Friday night, August 30, at SMU’s Ford Stadium — will be televised nationally by ESPN. If you were to go, you might see some familiar faces: Lance McIlhenny, who quarterbacked the Mustang’s lethal option offense in the early 1980s, attends often, as does Eric Dickerson, one half (with Craig James) of SMU’s famed Pony Express backfield, who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the NFL; and so, occasionally, does former head coach Ron Meyer, the architect of SMU’s disgrace. Coach Meyer left SMU for the NFL in 1982, where he won two AFC coach of the year awards and finished with a career record four games over .500. Later he teamed up with SMU’s most notorious bagman turned player agent, Sherwood Blount, representing some of the same players he had once recruited. Now he’s mostly on TV, doing NFL commentary for a Canadian sports network. You might think Meyer would not be welcome anymore on the SMU campus. But only if, after all these years, you still haven’t forgotten.

A former slave who helped free those still in bondage, she’s a perfect choice to replace murderous Andrew Jackson. And that’s the problem. Nowadays, it’s impossible to honor many true giants because their line of work itself has become suspect. The blame for this lies almost entirely with the right wing, which vilifies, belittles or simply defunds environmentalists, women’s health-care champions, seekers of urban justice, defenders of proper city planning and even honest scientists. 'HAMILTON' CREATOR THRILLED ABOUT 'TUBMAN' ON THE 20 So here are the greatest American heroines who will never be on a bill — entirely because the radical right has turned their work from something essential into something controversial. Sanger probably did more for American women than any other person. Radicalized by federal laws banning contraception, she began her career as a women’s health care activist by caring for women after botched “back-alley” abortions. Eventually, she turned her attention to preventing unwanted pregnancies, coining the term “birth control” in 1914, getting arrested for distributing diaphragms, and creating the precursor to Planned Parenthood. Later in life, she pressured scientists to create an oral contraceptive, which we all know today as The Pill. And just before her death, the Supreme Court struck down the anti-contraception laws that Sanger spent her life fighting. Today, her pioneering work is marginalized in the debate over abortion, thanks to the terminations performed by Planned Parenthood today. Carson basically founded the environmental movement with her 1962 book, “Silent Spring,” which Gladwelled the idea that pesticides were hurting the environment. The chemical companies and their right-wing enablers hated her, but her work led to bans on DDT and other toxins — and even led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Nixon, a Republican when being Republican meant caring for the environment. Funny how the one agency that almost every GOP candidate demonizes on the campaign trail is the one Nixon created. Jacobs in no small part saved urban America, thanks to her book, “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” in 1961. Jacobs’ targets in the book — suburbanification, mallification and anti-city superstition — are the basics of Republican urban policy these days. She was way ahead of her time in opposing Robert Moses’ vision of highway-cluttered cities, and her notion that sidewalks, not cars, are the key to urban vitality still makes the SUV-loving GOP crazy. Plus, her fight against Moses’ proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway saved Greenwich Village, that hotbed of liberalism. Cammermeyer was, in essence, the first gays-in-the-military activist, albeit an unwitting one. After a 15-year marriage to a man, Cammermeyer, a long serving National Guard vet who had won a Bronze Star in Vietnam, began a relationship with a woman. During a routine security clearance hearing in 1989, she chose not to lie about it, admitting that she was a lesbian. She was drummed out of the service for it — the highest ranking person to be discharged because of her sexual orientation. She fought the discharge and won — leading to the end of the ban on homosexuals serving in the military and also the end of the equally discriminatory “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.” The work of Mead, an anthropologist, helped bring about the Sexual Revolution, which continues to horrify the right wing to this day. Mead criticized Victorian values as stunting American children’s transition to adult sexuality, and championed biology over social conventions. In the later part of her career, she urged Americans to get comfortable with sexual orientations different from their own. She was widely criticized for bringing her own “pansexual” agenda into her research, but most credible scientists support her findings. Another reason why she’ll never get on a bill: Jimmy Carter gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Still another? She’s credited with the famous activist creed: “Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” That kind of talk scares some people.

The Grossglockner reaches an elevation of 3,798 meters (12,461 feet) above sea level and is not only the highest mountain in Austria but also the highest peak in the entire Eastern Alps range. This majestic mountain is part of the Glockner Group, a subrange of the High Tauern mountain range, which in turn is a part of the more extensive Central Eastern Alps.

In addition to being the highest peak in Austria, the Grossglockner is also home to the Pasterze Glacier, which is the longest glacier in Austria and the Eastern Alps. This glacier stretches for about 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) and is a famous tourist attraction. The Grossglockner High Alpine Road, a well-known mountain pass road, offers exceptional views of the Grossglockner and its surrounding peaks, as well as an opportunity to observe the Pasterze Glacier up close. The area around the Grossglockner is part of the Hohe Tauern National Park, which is the largest national park in Austria and the second-largest in Europe. The park offers various outdoor recreational activities, including hiking, rock climbing, ice climbing, skiing, and birdwatching, making it an attractive destination for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers. The unique combination of diverse flora and fauna, outstanding geological and geomorphological features, and the high concentration of glaciers within the park creates a distinctive landscape that appeals to global visitors.

Negative Yelp Review Title: Disappointing experience at Famous Delights Restaurant I am an ardent food lover, and ever since Famous Delights opened in our area, I was excited to give it a try. Finally, my friends and I decided to dine there last Saturday, but sadly, our experience was far from being delightful. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we sensed an air of unprofessionalism. We had a reservation at 7:30 PM, but the hostess took nearly 15 minutes to find a suitable table for us. Although the place was spacious and well-lit, the tables were quite close to each other, making it difficult for us to have private conversations. Our evening was off to a rough start, but we still pinned our hopes on the food to salvage the experience. The server took our orders after an excruciatingly long wait of 20 minutes, and he seemed overwhelmed and careless when jotting down our choices. The menu had an impressive variety, but the actual food failed to match up. The Famous Delights Chicken that came highly recommended was greasy and lacked essential seasoning. The vegetables in our salad seemed old and the dressing tasted overpoweringly of vinegar. On top of that, our side dish, the garlic mashed potatoes, had hardly any garlic flavors. We tried addressing these concerns with our server, but he was visibly disinterested and dismissive of our feedback. Our drinks were refilled only once, and one of my friends never received her beverage. As the meal proceeded, we observed how the staff was ignoring other patrons—helping us understand that our experience was not an isolated incident. People at neighboring tables were voicing their dissatisfaction, and unfortunately, nobody seemed to care about their concerns. The overall ambiance suffered from the lackadaisical attitude of the staff. The entire evening was marred by poor food quality, unresponsive staff, and an intrusive atmosphere. My friends and I left feeling disappointed and frustrated with the whole experience. I rarely write reviews, but I felt the need to share our experience to give others a heads-up before visiting Famous Delights. In conclusion, Famous Delights seems to have dropped the ball when it comes to meeting the basic expectations of any food enthusiast. I hope the management takes the necessary steps to improve their service and food quality. Until then, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone, and my friends and I will not be returning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Run-down and left to the elements, these abandoned buildings offer a sometimes macabre, often poignant insight into their history - as a leper colony. The centuries-old institution on the Greek island of Chios once housed dozens of outcasts who had contracted the disease, which is still often misunderstood today. These evocative photos by Kelly Katsarou vividly reveal the environment in which the lepers were forced to live out their lives. Scroll down for video. Welcoming? The gates to the leper colony situated on the Greek island of Chios. Cruel: But parts of the archaic colony can also be unexpectedly beautiful, as these pictures show. Isolated: The building is shut off from the rest of the island to prevent the infection spreading. Left to suffer: This woman shows the affects of. leprosy to her hands and face. Greek leper colonies are the subject of. Victoria Hislop's best-seling debut novel The Island. Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections. Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy. In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide. The colony, called Lovokomeio, opened in 1378 as the first leper colony in Greece and one of the first in all of Europe. It. was intended to isolate those suffering from leprosy and other. contagious skin diseases from the rest of society in order to avoid. infecting others. The origins of leprosy, now known to be caused by a bacterium, were then unknown, adding to the stigma placed on its sufferers. As the disease was so poorly understood, many of the 'lepers' sent to the colony did not even suffer from it - rather, they had other skin diseases or fungal infections. Such was the fear and stigma, settlements were usually built in. isolated locations such as islands. Sometimes, however, they. were deliberately set up to be accessible so that they were kept in the public eye, and thus received a steady flow of. donations. Lovokomeio was no such colony. Fitting with the commonly held belief of the time that the disease was a punishment from God, there was a church dedicated to St Lazarus, the patron saint of lepers. Step inside: The abandoned leper colony is now a tourist attraction since being shut down in 1957. Picturesque: Some of the photographs make you forget the sinister past of the buildings. Eerie: Other images bring home the horror of what used to happen at the institution. Outdated: Lepers were made to live with one another and forbidden from mixing with their families. It is just one of the run-down buildings on the colony photographed by Kelly Katsarou, where children’s. notebooks and medicines lie scattered alongside open tombs. Doors are smashed, stripped beds lie. rusting, and rotting floorboards give an ominous creak whenever someone. is foolhardy enough to put their weight on them. While it would of course have been. miserable to be separated from one's family and placed in a. colony, these pictures show that there were positives to be found in life at the colony. Ancient: The colony opened in 1378 as one of the first homes for lepers in the whole of Europe. Beautiful: Photographer Kelly Katsarou managed to transform the creepy colony into these stunning images. Decline: The 19th century brought warfare and natural disasters to Chios. Sign: A Greek poster advertising 'The leper colony of Chios' to would-be visitors. Some areas of the complex are undeniably beautiful, and it could have been a consolation to spend time with fellow sufferers who could empathise with each others' plight. The colony at Chios began to decline during the 19th century, when the island was the centre of fierce fighting in the Greek War of Independence. By the middle of the century Chios was largely deserted, and the situation was worsened by an 1881 earthquake which killed nearly 8,000 people. The colony was finally shut down for. good in 1957, by which time a cure had been found for leprosy and much. of the stigma had disappeared in the West. However, there are still hundreds of leper colonies open around the world, particularly in India. Storeroom: Old furniture from the colony stacked up in a room since it closed down. Mystery: The cause of leprosy was unknown until it was discovered to be a bacterium in the late 19th century. Stigma: Many believed that the illness was a curse from God due to references to it in the Bible. Relic: But hundreds of leper colonies are still operating around the world, particularly in India. Back in time: The building has been left just as it was and is now a valuable historical exhibit. Grim: But some leprosy sufferers may have been able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life.

Answer:","output":"Gérard Ouellet was born on February 17, 1913, in East Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Despite being born in the United States, his life and career were deeply rooted in Canada as he and his family eventually moved to Rimouski, Quebec. He dedicated his life to public service, which was evident through his lengthy involvement as a politician and a devoted family man. Before embarking on a political career, Ouellet pursued the humble profession of farming. This provided him with a deep understanding of the struggles and challenges faced by the agricultural sector, which became a key component of his political platform later in life. Ouellet's political affiliations and beliefs were with the Progressive Conservative Social Credit party. This political party had a complex blend of ideologies, combining conservative fiscal values with aspects of social welfare and equitable distribution of resources. His party membership signified that he was a firm believer in responsible, sustainable economic policies, as well as the importance of addressing social issues faced by everyday individuals. This dedication to balance and equitable opportunity made him a popular figure among his constituents. In April 1963, at the age of 50, Ouellet was elected to represent the riding of Rimouski in the Canadian Federal Parliament. Upon taking office, he actively participated in the process of shaping policies not only for the residents of Rimouski, but for all Canadians, demonstrating his ongoing commitment to public service. In his capacity as a Member of Parliament he sought to improve policies that affected the local agricultural industry using the valuable knowledge he gained as a farmer. Ouellet's term in office lasted until September 1965. Although his tenure was relatively brief compared to other politicians, he left his mark on the political landscape of the time. During his tenure, he advocated for policies and legislation that would reinforce the agricultural sector and improve the quality of life for everyday Canadians. Parallel to his political career, Ouellet maintained a fulfilling personal life with his spouse Germaine Parent. Their partnership and unwavering support for one another no doubt contributed to Ouellet's dedication and perseverance in his political and professional pursuits.  Gérard Ouellet passed away on April 3, 1975, in Rimouski, Quebec – a testament to his deep connection to the region he served loyally throughout his life. His passion for addressing social and economic issues, coupled with his career as a farmer and his time in office, left an indelible mark on the political fabric of his time. Ouellet's life remains a shining example of an individual who devoted their life to public service and bettering the lives of their fellow citizens."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Windpower can convert energy into electricity, and ask you the question \\"what does windpower get converted into?\\", is the correct answer \\"magnet\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"magnet\\". When discussing wind power, the conversion of energy usually refers to the conversion of kinetic energy from wind into electrical energy. This process takes place within a wind turbine, where the wind's kinetic energy turns the turbine's blades, which spins a generator to create electricity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Wind blows and pushes against the blades of a wind turbine. 2. The blades, being carefully shaped and angled, are set into motion by the force of the wind. 3. The rotation of the blades turns a central shaft, usually with the help of a gearbox to increase the rotational speed. 4. The central shaft is connected to a generator, which is comprised of magnets and coils of wire. 5. The spinning shaft causes the magnets to rotate around the coils of wire, generating an electrical current. 6. The generated electrical current is then transmitted through power lines to be distributed and used for various applications. So, in summary, wind power gets converted into electrical energy, not a magnet. The magnets are a component of the generator within the wind turbine, which plays a crucial role in converting the wind's kinetic energy into electricity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are.

To provide a detailed answer: Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb member of the nationalist secret society known as the Black Hand. This assassination is considered one of the main triggers for the beginning of World War I. At that time, Bosnia was under the administration of Austria-Hungary, and the Archduke's visit was seen as a provocation by the nationalist groups who sought independence from Austro-Hungarian rule. After a failed attempt to kill the Archduke with a bomb earlier in the day, Gavrilo Princip took advantage of a wrong turn made by Archduke's driver and shot both Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, at a close distance.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If the pancreas releases more insulin than necessary, it will cause blood sugar levels to decrease more than normal, potentially leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). As a result, cells in the pancreas will need to release more glucagon to counteract the excess insulin and help bring blood sugar levels back to normal. The liver will then convert more stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood.

But, as they say, love knows no age or boundaries. And so, Prince Harland and Queen Gran's love story continued to mystify those who knew them. In the large room full of people, the queen's presence didn't go unnoticed. In her modest attire, tending to the needs of her kingdom and people, she transcended the pomp and circumstance of the typical royal demeanor. Queen Gran could have chosen a life of luxury, opulence, and indulgence, but instead, she valued simplicity and the contentment it brought.  As the unlikely couple stood side by side, their love and affection for each other warmed the hearts of those around them. It was evident that love isn't just about physical allure or elaborate gestures; true love is based on connection, understanding, and a shared life built on trust and respect.  Jared couldn't help but be slightly envious of the emotional bond that Prince Harland and Queen Gran shared. While he had always seen the queen as an authoritative figure who commanded respect and submission, Prince Harland's tales of laughter, whispered secrets, and the simple joys they shared as a couple painted an entirely different picture.  Looking around the room, Jared realized that if a humble woman like the queen could find such immense happiness and fulfillment in her unconventional love story, perhaps there was hope for everyone. It challenged the stereotypes that came with royalty and the expectations society held for members of the royal family. As the evening progressed, the lively chatter in the room grew louder; with both young and old sharing stories of love, listening to one another, and finding solace in the hope that true companionship isn't reserved only for those deemed picture-perfect by society's standards. The queen's unpretentious nature reminded everyone that, beneath the crown, she was still a woman with feelings, desires, and dreams, just like them. As the room emptied and the guests bid their farewells, Jared found himself contemplating the beauty of love and its power to break through social constructs. The genuine connection between Prince Harland and Queen Gran left an indelible mark on his notions of love, prompting him to redefine what he had previously believed. In the end, this simple evening had brought forth a profound lesson for all who were present: a queen is a queen, no matter what she wears – or does. It's not about the garments or the adornments; instead, it's about the heart within and the genuine love she shares with her consort, her people, and herself. And perhaps, if we look deeper, we'll see that in every woman – queen or not – there lies the same desire to love and be loved, and to find happiness in the arms of those who truly matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last year Boult taught at the Royal College of Music?  Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel.

If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion.

The southernmost large city in Europe, it lies on the Costa del Sol (\\"Coast of the Sun\\") of the Mediterranean, about east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about north of Africa.  - The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history. It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world.

When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas.

The southern part in Pennsylvania is now the York County Heritage Rail Trail which connects to a similar hike/bike trail in Northern Maryland down to Baltimore, named the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. Only the trackage around Baltimore remains in rail service.  - The Baltimore Light Rail is a light rail system serving Baltimore, Maryland, United States, as well as its surrounding suburbs. It is operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA Maryland). In downtown Baltimore, it uses city streets. Outside the central portions of the city, the line is built on private rights-of-way, mostly from the defunct Northern Central Railway, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad and Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. The line is sometimes referred to the \\"Blue Line\\", or less commonly as the \\"Central Light Rail Line\\", even though the line carries three different routes on the same system: Hunt Valley-BWI (Blue), Hunt Valley-Cromwell (Yellow), and Penn Station-Camden Yards (Red).   - The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A) was an American railroad of central Maryland and Washington, D.C., built in the 19th and 20th century. The WB&A absorbed two older railroads, the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad and the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line, and added its own electric streetcar line between Baltimore and Washington. It was built by a group of Cleveland, Ohio, electric railway entrepreneurs to serve as a high-speed, showpiece line using the most advanced technology of the time. It served Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis, Maryland, for 27 years before the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile forced an end to passenger service in 1935. Only the Baltimore & Annapolis portion continued to operate. Today, parts of the right-of-way are used for light rail, rail trails and roads.  - The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture. The system has many connections to other transit agencies of Central Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and south-central Pennsylvania (Hanover, Harrisburg, and York): WMATA, Charm City Circulator, Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland, Annapolis Transit, Rabbit Transit, Ride-On, and TransIT.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Light rail, light rail transit (LRT) or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an exclusive right-of-way.  - Gilroy Road is a stop on the Baltimore Light Rail . Northbound trains leave this station for Hunt Valley ; southbound trains leave for BWI Airport , and , during off - peak hours , Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie . There is currently no free public parking and no bus service at this station . The Gilroy Road stop is one of four stops along the Baltimore Light Rail line in Hunt Valley , and is the southernmost on the line within Hunt Valley .  - The Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad was an American railroad of central Maryland built in the 19th century. The railroad, the second to serve Annapolis, ran between Annapolis and Clifford along the north shore of the Severn River. From Clifford, just north of the present day Patapsco Light Rail Stop, it connected with the B&O's Curtis Bay branch so that trains could travel to Baltimore. In 1921, when it was called the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line, it was purchased by the larger Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A), and then emerged from the WB&A's 1935 bankruptcy and closure as the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad. B&A electric passenger operation between the two cities continued until 1950, at which time the rail line became solely a freight carrier, operating buses for passenger service. Freight service to Annapolis continued until June 1968 when the Severn River Trestle was declared unsafe. In the 1980s the line was completely shut down. The right-of-way now serves as part of Baltimore's light rail system and as the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail.

Joseph Needham made significant contributions to the study of Chinese history, science, and technology. He is best known for his work on the history of Chinese science and civilization, particularly through his monumental series \\"Science and Civilisation in China\\". Joseph Needham's interest in Chinese science and culture began during his time at Cambridge University in the 1930s when he collaborated with several Chinese colleagues. His fascination grew, and during World War II, he was sent to China as the British scientific attaché. There, he built strong relationships with Chinese scholars and collected valuable information on ancient Chinese innovations, achievements, and scientific discoveries. Needham's research led him to explore the reasons behind the decline of science in China and the reasons for the West's scientific and industrial revolution. This culminated in what is known as \\"Needham's Grand Question\\" or \\"The Needham Question\\": Why did modern science, which developed from roots in ancient Greek and Hellenistic civilizations, eventually thrive in Western Europe but stagnate in China, despite China's advanced civilization and technological achievements during various periods of its history? In 1948, Needham founded the East Asian Institute at Cambridge University, which later became the Needham Research Institute. The institute is dedicated to the research and study of Chinese and East Asian science, technology, and medicine with a focus on their historical context. In summary, while there are links between European scientists learning about Chinese science and culture through correspondence and Joseph Needham's work, the statement does not specifically mention Joseph Needham or the institute named after him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A. \\"Le Kiss of Death\\" for *ANY* movie. Its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad (e.g. Congo)if Hudson is in it (with the exception of the Ghostbusters films, which were intentionally campy and bad). Despite my instincts, and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand, yet another cinematic \\"tour de force\\" starring Lisa Raye, I rented it anyway. After all, I ignored my \\"Hudson instinct\\" on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I'd give this movie a chance. If you are a lover of bad movies, this is a definite must see! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time. The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death. To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping. The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \\"The debt is paid\\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced. If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie. Unfortunately, he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition, sound design (in his defense, Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece), set design, script writing nor period historical research (was it me,or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west?) seriously.

Let's analyze each statement in detail to understand the difference. 1. Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still: This statement suggests that the majority of events or circumstances that occurred after a certain point in time had a nightmarish quality. It implies that these events were unpleasant, distressing, or frightening in some way, and that their effects or memories may still be haunting to the person experiencing them. The use of the word \\"most\\" indicates that not all the events were nightmarish, meaning that some potentially neutral or positive events may have taken place as well. 2. Nothing that followed was nightmarish: Contrary to the first statement, this one expresses a completely different idea. It denies any nightmarish qualities to the events or circumstances that took place after a certain point in time. By stating that \\"nothing\\" was nightmarish, it suggests that everything that happened was either neutral or positive in nature, with no negative or distressing aspects at all. This statement exudes a sense of relief or satisfaction, as it implies the absence of any frightening or troubling experiences.

Let's combine the coefficients of j, then isolate j, and finally, solve for j. 1. Combine the coefficients of j: The coefficients of j are -237, -289, and 450. We need to add these together to get the combined coefficient for j. -237 + (-289) + 450 = -526 + 450 = -76 Now, we have the equation: -76*j + 1064 = 0 2. Isolate j: The next step is to get j by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will move the constant, 1064, to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. -76*j + 1064 - 1064 = 0 - 1064 -76*j = -1064 3. Solve for j: To find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is -76. -76*j / -76 = -1064 / -76 j = 14 So, the solution for the given equation is j = 14."},{"instruction":"Title: THE PREVIOUS FIVE STAR REVIEWER CAN BEND OVER AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN Review: PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER WHOSE ONLY WORK IN LIFE IS TO SLAM GREAT CLASSIC ROCK BANDS AND HE THEN CRIES WOLF WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SLAM THE TRASH (JUSTIN,BRITNEY,ASHLEE,JENNIFER LOPEZ,BACKSTREET BOYS)THAT HE LISTENS TO.N STYNC ARE HISTORY AND THEIR ALBUMS HAVE BOMBED THE WORLD OVER.THE BOY BAND ERA IS OVER SO DONT BE SEEN WITH THIS AWFUL CD.REVIEW OVER.OVER AND OUT Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The short review states that the movie is \\"really funny,\\" which implies that the critic enjoyed its comedic aspects and found humor in the film. This positive reaction shows that the critic had a good time watching the movie and would likely encourage others to watch it for its entertainment value. When interpreting reviews, it's essential to look for keywords and phrases that convey the overall sentiment toward the subject. In this case, the critic used words like \\"really funny\\" to express their amusement, suggesting a positive mindset. In contrast, if the reviewer had used words such as \\"boring\\" or \\"tedious,\\" these would have indicated a negative opinion. A positive outlook on a film, especially when it comes to comedy, is important because the effectiveness of humor can be subjective. What one person finds funny, another may not. Therefore, when someone openly shares their positive enjoyment of the movie, it sets a positive tone for potential viewers who share a similar sense of humor. Additionally, a positive review can boost the morale of the creators, cast, and crew and inspire them to continue producing quality work.

R.i.c.e. stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. This principle can be used at home to treat forearm tendinitis and should be practiced on a daily basis for the best results.  Rest the your forearm. Possible answers:  1). If you walk or drive on your elbow, your forearm joint should stay elevated. If your elbow is loose and inflamed, rest it for approximately two or three weeks so any swelling goes down and you can recover.  2). Get your skin soaked in water by curling it under a shower or by stopping the water from running completely cold on your forearm. The cold water will encourage blood to flow to and from the ligaments and tendons helping them firm up.  3). Resting the forearm is crucial to safely treat wrist tendinitis. If you are injured, immobilize the affected arm with an ice pack or splint to stop swelling and degeneration.  4). Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating tendinitis, especially in athletes. Athletes who continue to push through tendon pain risk escalating their injury from the acute inflammation phase to chronic tendinitis, which is much harder to treat.","output":"The paragraph would end with option 4: \\"Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating tendinitis, especially in athletes.

Option 1 is inconsistent with the subject; we don't 'walk or drive on our elbows'. Moreover, it doesn't address the role of resting to treat forearm tendinitis. Option 2 advocates for using cold water to relax the forearm tendons, which isn't aligned with the rest concept emphasized previously in the paragraph.

Q:I can use this background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl  Now, I have a new situation: Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week. Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group.  Answer this question please: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","output":"In the given situation, the shielding effect is larger in cesium compared to lithium.  To understand why, let's first recall what the shielding effect is: The shielding effect refers to the ability of inner electrons in an atom to shield the valence electrons from the attractive force of the positively charged protons in the nucleus. This reduces the effective positive charge experienced by the outer electrons. Now, let's look at lithium (Li) and cesium (Cs), both alkali metals: 1. Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 electrons. The electron configuration is 1s² 2s¹. It has two inner electrons and one valence electron.  2. Cesium (Cs) has an atomic number of 55, meaning it has 55 electrons. The electron configuration is [Xe] 6s¹. It has 54 inner electrons and one valence electron. As you move down a group in the periodic table, the number of energy levels (shells) increases, and so does the number of inner electrons. In the case of Cs, there are more inner electrons than in Li. These inner electrons provide more shielding for the valence electron in Cs than those in Li. This increased shielding weakens the attraction between the valence electron and the nucleus in Cs, leading to a larger shielding effect in cesium compared to lithium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Around 9 a.m., two apparent supporters of Bo were quickly hustled away by police when they began shouting slogans. Gu and a household aide, Zhang Xiaojun, have been charged with murder in the poisoning death of a British businessman, Neil Heywood, with whom Gu allegedly had a business dispute. Bo has not been charged with any crime but was removed from all his party posts in the spring for unspecified “discipline violations.” Gu’s conviction is considered a foregone conclusion in China, where the police, courts and prosecutors operate under the party’s tight control and largely according to script. But the evidence presented in court, any witnesses allowed to speak and the severity of the eventual sentence that Gu receives will all signal how the party intends to handle Bo. Bo, the charismatic son of a Mao-era revolutionary hero, is still thought to command a following in China, particularly among the “new leftists” disenchanted with the country’s growing income disparity and the loss of socialist ideals. Some analysts say that the party’s senior leaders, who are meeting now for their annual summer retreat at the Beidaihe seaside resort, remain deeply divided over what punishment Bo should face. On the one hand, observers say, some want Bo not only stripped of his party positions but also jailed on criminal charges, to preclude any chance of a comeback by a figure who had become a danger because of his populist appeal. “He may come back to politics,” said Cheng Li, a China scholar with the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It’s in everyone’s interest to punish Bo severely.” But Bo is said to still have allies, who think he should face a milder internal party discipline, equivalent to a censure, particularly if there is no evidence that he had a hand in Heywood’s slaying or knew anything about it. “It’s a question of how to settle this problem after ousting him,” said Bo Zhiyue, who is a senior researcher with the National University of Singapore and not related to Bo Xilai. “It’s not just him. He represents a trend of thought in society,” such as favoring a more equitable distribution of wealth. “A lot of senior party members agree with this idea. Bo Xilai still has a lot of political resources, like his personal relationships among the princelings and in the army. . . . He still has a lot of influence, and supporters in the party. So it will be hard to completely defeat him.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The murder trial of Gu Kailai, wife of Chinese politician Bo Xilai, begins amidst tight security in Hefei, as China's leaders hope for a resolution to the Bo Xilai saga. Gu and household aide Zhang Xiaojun are charged with the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, while Bo's ultimate fate remains a subject of debate within the party due to his remaining influence and popularity among the new leftists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.  Question: \\"How much faster is Orion's computer to the space shuttle's computer?\\" Answer: \\"400 times\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"How much faster is Orion's computer to the space shuttle's computer?\\" is correct.

A:","output":"A: The first declaration of World War 1, also known as the Great War, can be traced back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The roots of the conflict, however, can be found in the complex web of alliances and tensions created as a result of various military, political, and economic factors. These factors contributed to the overall instability in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The event that triggered the formal declaration of war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, on June 28, 1914. This assassination took place in Sarajevo, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now the capital of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was a member of the Serbian nationalist group called the Black Hand. Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum to Serbia, making several demands which, if not met, would lead to war. Serbia agreed to most of the demands but did not fully comply with the ultimatum. Consequently, the Austro-Hungarian government deemed this response unsatisfactory, and on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This declaration marks the beginning of the devastating four-year global conflict known as World War 1. As a direct result of the assassination and the subsequent declaration of war, the intricate network of alliances that existed between the European powers began to activate. These alliances included the Triple Entente (consisting of Russia, France, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy).  The Triple Entente pledged their support to Serbia, while the Triple Alliance stood by Austria-Hungary. Ultimately, this led to the spiraling of the conflict into a full-blown world war. Other countries and empires, such as the Ottoman Empire and Japan, joined the conflict later on, serving only to further exacerbate the bloodshed and destruction. In summary, the first declaration of war within the context of World War 1 was made by the Austro-Hungarian Empire against Serbia on July 28, 1914. This declaration was in response to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Serbia's perceived failure to comply with the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum. The declaration of war set in motion a chain of events that ultimately embroiled much of the world in a costly and devastating conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers. They believe intelligent life exists   somewhere in the universe. They also think we will soon contact these beings. Why do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets? The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \\"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\\" say Shostak and Barnet. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \\"Tools like the Hubble telescope have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\\" says Shostak. \\"And our galaxy, the Milk Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\\" In the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes  allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life. Have beings from space already visited Earth? \\"Probably not,\\" says Shostak. \\"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signs. In fact, they may be trying to communicate with us now, but we don't have the right tools to receive their messages. However, this is changing.

Waters initially served as the group's bassist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, conceptual leader and co-lead vocalist.  - A comprehensive world view or worldview is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and point of view. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics. The term is a calque of the German word Weltanschauung , composed of \\"Welt\\" ('world') and \\"Anschauung\\" ('view' or 'outlook'). The German word is also used in English.  - A rock opera is a collection of rock music songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas typically are released as concept albums and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as rock musicals. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as rap opera.  - The Jeff Beck Group was an English rock band formed in London in January 1967 by former The Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck. Their innovative approach to heavy-sounding blues and rhythm and blues was a major influence on popular music.  - Eric Patrick Clapton, (born 1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" and fourth in Gibson's \\"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\\". He was also named number five in \\"Time\\" magazine's list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\" in 2009.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Roger Keith \\"Syd\\" Barrett (6 January 1946  7 July 2006) was an English musician, composer, singer-songwriter, and painter. Best known as a founder member of the band Pink Floyd, Barrett was the lead singer, guitarist and principal songwriter in its early years and is credited with naming the band. Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 after David Gilmour took over as their new guitarist, and was briefly hospitalised amid speculation of mental illness.  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.  - \`\` What God Wants , Part I '' is the first song in a series of songs written and released by former Pink Floyd bassist , Roger Waters on his third solo album , Amused to Death . \`\` What God Wants '' is separated into three parts , much like Pink Floyd 's earlier work with \`\` Another Brick in the Wall '' . Though the song is in three parts , \`\` What God Wants Pt. 1 '' , was the only one to be released as a single . The song features the guitar playing of Jeff Beck . This part in particular deals with the contradictory duality and hypocrisy perceived by Waters in dogmatic religion and its power over man . The following parts , along with the other songs on the album , deal with worship not only in religion but also in regard to materialism and consumption . All together , its viewpoint is on the power of simplistic conformity ; how people adhere to something , not entirely by volition , but out of submission .  - Amused to Death is the third studio album by Roger Waters. It was released in 1992, and is his most recent studio album.  - Nicholas Berkeley \\"Nick\\" Mason (born 27 January 1944) is an English musician and composer, best known as the drummer of progressive rock group Pink Floyd.   - Geoffrey Arnold \\"Jeff\\" Beck (born 24 June 1944) is an English rock guitarist. He is one of the three noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds (the other two being Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is the title of three songs set to variations of the same basic theme, on Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera, \\"The Wall\\", subtitled Part 1 (working title \\"Reminiscing\\"), Part 2 (working title \\"Education\\"), and Part 3 (working title \\"Drugs\\"). All parts were written by Pink Floyd's bassist, Roger Waters.  - James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin.  - The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released as a double album on 30 November 1979 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. Considered one of the most famous concept albums by any artist, \\"The Wall\\" features the band's only single to top various charts, \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\", followed with \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". In 1982, the album was adapted into a feature film: \\"Pink Floyd  The Wall\\".

A debt-collection company in Buffalo used lies and trickery to fraudulently collect more than 31 million from thousands of people across the country, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said Tuesday in announcing guilty pleas by four participants and charges against 11 others.      U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the millions of dollars involved could make it the largest fraudulent debt-collection scheme ever prosecuted.      The collectors, he said, took “ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves” by threatening them with arrest and coercing some into paying more than they owed.      Court papers describe orchestrated lies. Victims were told, for example, that they had committed a felony by failing to pay debts, that their driver’s licenses would be suspended and they would be referred to an “attorney network.”      One collector told the mother of a debtor undergoing dialysis that he was a “legal investigator’’ with a law firm, not a collection agency, and that he was calling about check fraud, according to court papers. In a third example, a collector told victims that they had committed fraud and that he was “in contact with the magistrate. …”      “They are en route right now,” he reportedly continued. “Within 46 minutes, they will be there to serve you.”      Prosecutors say that company owners Travell Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park, and Maurice Sessum, 39, of Buffalo, instructed employees to “juice” balances to trick people into thinking they owed greater sums than they might have believed. The prosecutors said Thomas spent some of his resulting fortune to gamble and pay for sports tickets, his wedding reception, jewelry and cosmetic surgery for his wife.      While court papers and prosecutors do not name the debt-collection company, Thomas and Sessum were named as the principals of an assortment of debt-collection companies that the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman sought to shut down in February because of allegedly abusive practices. In that case, Thomas and Sessum are named as principal managers and officers of 4 Star Resolution LLC, Profile Management Inc. and International Recovery Service LLC, among others.      Attorney Michael A. Benson, of Springville, represents Thomas and is one of the lawyers representing 4 Star. He said he does not yet know whether he also will represent Thomas on the criminal charges. But he said Thomas was en route to Benson’s office Tuesday morning and would have surrendered to the authorities had they not arrested him at his home.      Thomas and the other defendants all pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.      Benson said the FTC and now the U.S. Attorney’s Office set the fraudulently obtained figure at 31 million, but they ignore the fact that legitimate debts were being collected and that the company’s principals had payroll and other business expenses to pay from the proceeds, which were collected over seven or eight years.      “They make it look in the indictment that they unsealed today that these gentlemen took the money and ran,” Benson said. “That is completely not true.” He went on to say that it will be difficult and expensive for the defendants to face charges in New York City and that he expected their lawyers to attempt to move the case to Buffalo.      Asked why the criminal matter was begun in New York City and not Buffalo, a spokeswoman for Bharara said the FTC referred the case to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District.      The charges are wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The prosecutors announced that four company employees have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The four are: Mark Lavin, 45, of Buffalo; John Salatino, 34, of Amherst; Jessica Mann, 30, of Dunkirk; and Jennifer Sherk, 27, of Buffalo.      Others facing the charges are: Anthony Brzezowski, 49, of Buffalo, the company’s director of operations; company managers Jimmy Stokes, 38, of Buffalo; Heather Gasta, 41, of Buffalo; and Tacoby Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park; and debt collectors Anthony Caba, 25, of Buffalo; Columbus Simmons, 46, of Buffalo; Charles Starks, 32, of Buffalo; William Clark, 30, of Buffalo; and Michael Calandra, 31, of Angola.      email: citydesk@buffnews.com ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The company based in Buffalo, New York, had an \\"elite team\\" that used \\"particularly aggressive and egregious tactics in attempting to trick consumers into paying debts,\\" the indictment charged.

While the information provided suggests that Downtown LA's Children's Museum is closed pending the construction of two new sites, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation for the closure. There could be several reasons why the original Children's Museum in Downtown LA is closed, and the opening of new facilities might just be one part of the story. The closure could be due to financial constraints, maintenance issues, or a strategic decision by the city to revamp its approach to children's educational and cultural resources. The opening of two new sites, one in the San Fernando Valley and one in Little Tokyo, could indicate that the City of Los Angeles has recognized the need for additional venues for children's learning and engagement. The new facilities may be better equipped to address changing demographics, harness new technologies, and provide improved accessibility to diverse communities across the region. The intent could be to upgrade the city's offerings for children by creating enhanced, modern, and dynamic spaces to foster learning and creativity. There is no doubt that the opening of these new facilities will provide better resources for the city's younger generation. However, without additional details and context regarding the closure of the Downtown LA Children's Museum, concluding that it is solely due to the opening of new facilities would be an incomplete analysis. It is important to consider all factors that could have influenced the decision to close the museum and plan for the new sites."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man convicted of stalking singer Madonna, and who once threatened to knife her, was arrested Friday, a week after he escaped from a Southern California mental hospital, police said. Robert Dewey Hoskins, 54, had walked away from Metropolitan State Hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk on February 3, police said. He had served a 10-year prison sentence for stalking the \\"Material Girl,\\" police said, and a court order requires him to be in a facility receiving mental health treatment until the end of August 2012. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mitzi Fierro told HLN's Nancy Grace that she hadn't been told whether any new charges will be filed against Hoskins. Prior to his arrest Friday, OPTIONS: - CNN police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - HLN police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Hoskins police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Los Angeles Police police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Madonna police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Material Girl police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Metropolitan State Hospital police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Mitzi Fierro police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Nancy Grace police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Norwalk police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Robert Dewey Hoskins police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Southern California police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\"","output":"Remember this a story about a man named Robert Dewey Hoskins, who did some very bad things like bothering and scaring a famous singer, named Madonna. After he caused a lot of trouble, he was put in a special care place called a mental hospital where people could take care of him and make sure he didn't do anything naughty. But one day, he managed to leave this care place without anyone's permission, which is a very big no-no. So, the police got involved to help find him and make sure he go back to his care place. Now you're asking, how should the story continue? Let's see. This man, Hoskins, may get very angry and do hurtful things when he's not taking his special medicine. So, the best choice here would be: - Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" Los Angeles is the city where all these things are happening, and it's the place where the police are working hard to make sure everyone stays safe from Hoskins. So, they gave everyone a heads up or a warning about him. It's similar to when Mom tells you not to touch the hot stove because you'll get burned.

Greg Tenorly and Cynthia Blockerman had been through quite an ordeal together--being hunted by police for the murder of her abusive husband while they ran from the real killer. But all that was behind them now. All charges against them had been dropped, and Cynthia's husband had been buried. And the rumors would have died down eventually if they had gone their separate ways. They could feel the stares as they walked to their table. Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best. Mama Castilla had run the place for over thirty years. She had taken over for her grandfather in 1973. A sign on the wall said so. Cynthia ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo. Greg went with his favorite, the Chicken Parmesan. Both ordered iced tea and salad. The bread and olive oil with roasted garlic and pepper came with every meal. Greg could not resist great bread. And this was the best. He tore off a chunk as soon as the waitress delivered it. Cynthia would wait for the salad. \\"So we're finally on a real date,\\" said Greg. \\"Yeah. So how does it feel?\\" \\"Kinda weird and scary and...wonderful.\\" Cynthia smiled and Greg momentarily forgot all about the amazing aroma in the restaurant. All he wanted to do was kiss her. But that would have to wait. So, his hunger came rushing back. Cynthia's mood turned serious. \\"I don't want to spoil our date, but I've got to tell you something.\\" Greg wondered if he had done something wrong. He could fix it--whatever it was. \\"I've asked Mom to move in with me.\\" \\"Why? I thought she was happy living in Marshall.\\" \\"She was.\\" \\"What do you mean?

Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\".

Article: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer.

It was one of those nights where the soft hum of the air conditioner and the faint glow of the streetlight outside their bedroom window simply couldn't soothe her to sleep. Gary, looking so peaceful, snuggled up in their cozy, comfortable bed, had a snoring problem that had lately been reaching unprecedented volumes. Despite a deep love that Jennifer had for her husband, she found herself unable to fall asleep, her eyes wide open as she stared at the ceiling, listening to the ceaseless chorus of Gary's snoring. It seemed as if she had tried everything to help him with this situation – from nasal strips to white noise machines – but nothing had made a lasting impact. It was on nights like these that she felt like her only choice was to seek solace on the couch. As Jennifer gently rolled out of their bed, grasping carefully for her pillow and an extra blanket in the dark, she tiptoed out of the bedroom in an effort not to disturb Gary's peaceful slumber. The wooden floors felt cool under her bare feet, and she could hear the rhythmic ticking of the large wall clock down the hall, a reminder that the night hours were slowly ticking away. Arriving in the living room, Jennifer was confronted with the cold, uninviting couch. The living room's dim lighting cast eerie shadows over the various knick-knacks they had collected together over the years, giving the room an almost haunted appearance. Suppressing a brief shiver, Jennifer shrugged off any fear and began to rearrange the cushions and throw blankets, turning the couch into a temporary haven for the night. Although not nearly as comfortable as their bed, the couch was a quiet respite in comparison, and Jennifer could feel herself gradually starting to unwind. As the minutes turned into hours, she found her thoughts wandering – from happy memories of their honeymoon in Greece to concerns about her upcoming project at work. Slowly, the soothing sound of silence began to lull her into a much-needed sleep, her weariness gradually overtaking any lingering discomfort from her unconventional choice of resting place. Meanwhile, in their bedroom, Gary's peaceful face suddenly creased into a slight frown, his subconscious mind aware that something was missing. The comforting warmth and familiar scent of his wife was gone, and though his conscious mind could not quite grasp it, he felt an undeniable void on the otherwise crowded bed. As dawn began to creep through the cracks in the curtains, washing the living room with a soft, almost ethereal light, Jennifer awoke with a start. The stiffness in her back and neck told her that while her night on the couch had been a temporary solution, it was not one that could become a habit. As Gary roused himself from sleep, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and instinctively reaching for his wife, he found her side of the bed cold and empty. Realizing the cause of her absence, a quiet determination settled in his heart. Together they decided to seek help – from sleep specialists, to couples therapy, to exploring alternative remedies – to regain not only a good night's rest but also the emotional closeness that comes with sharing a peaceful slumber. With a renewed commitment to overcoming their nighttime hurdle, Gary and Jennifer embarked on a journey to rebuild their shared sanctuary, rediscovering the support and love they had for one another beneath the once deafening sound of Gary's snoring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The context states that Rory McIlroy shot a bogey-free 66 (-6) final round, securing his second major title. The difference between his score and the runner-up, David Lynn, was eight strokes. This information supports the hypothesis that Rory McIlroy was victorious in this particular tournament by a significant margin of eight strokes. Furthermore, we can expand on this hypothesis by discussing some additional context. The 2012 PGA Championship was held at the Ocean Course of the Kiawah Island Golf Resort, a challenging and picturesque course situated in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, southwest of Charleston. The competition took place over four days, from August 9th to 12th.

This win at the 2012 PGA Championship marked his second major title, further solidifying his status as an elite golfer. His outstanding performance in the final round, which consisted of a bogey-free 66 (-6) score, demonstrates his skill, focus, and determination during this high-stakes event. Meanwhile, David Lynn, the runner-up in this tournament, also displayed impressive abilities on the golf course, finishing with a commendable result of eight strokes behind McIlroy.

Say your name, and if it’s an unusual name you might add spelling or a rhyme that the person can use to help remember your name.  If appropriate, add a detail about the reason you’re at the party. For example, “I’m Pam’s daughter,” if the people at the party are friends of your mother, or “I’m an anthropology major,” if this is a college department party. You can follow up by asking the other person to say his own name, but most of the time people respond by introducing themselves without being asked. People always like to hear nice things said about themselves. To have a great conversation with someone you’ve just met, say something nice about something the person is wearing. At most parties, other guests will have taken care with their appearance and will appreciate the attention.  You can also use a compliment to start a conversation by pairing it with a question. For example, you might say, “That’s a really cool scarf. Where did you get it?” Avoid compliments about the person’s appearance, as this might make her uncomfortable. If you don’t know anyone at the party, it’s okay to say so. This is easily done as you introduce yourself. For example, “Hi, I’m Mike. I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t know anyone here and you seemed nice.”  If the person is an extrovert, they may be happy to chat with you and introduce you to others in the group. Chances are, others may be in a similar situation. If you’re both newcomers to the group, you can laugh and talk about the challenges of being in this situation. There are certain topics that are likely to be met with awkward silence. If you don’t already know the political orientation of the party-goers, for example, never bring up the topic of politics or you might find yourself unintentionally offending others.  Don’t bring up overly personal details, whether of money, sex, illness or intimacy. Save these topics for people you know well. Making judgmental comments isn’t likely to be appreciated. For example, “You’d think she would know better than to wear that color with her complexion,” may not be appreciated. Never ask a woman if she’s pregnant. If she’s gained weight, she may feel embarrassed. Make brief eye contact with other people. A slight smile will help others know that you’re open to conversation.   When someone speaks to you, look at them attentively at least 70% of the time. Angle the front of your body towards the person who’s talking, which will help the person know you’re listening. You don’t want to maintain eye contact for too long, as this might seem aggressive or overly flirtatious. Instead, limit the eye contact for 4-5 seconds, before looking away, then looking again. If you don’t know anyone at the party, no one will have heard you tell your favorite funny anecdotes. Think about sharing a funny thing that happened to you. This will make you seem more relatable and friendly.  Be careful not to tell a story that may offend others. After all, humor is sometimes different across different groups of people. If you have a good story, it can fill in a conversational lull. Or you can connect your story to someone else’s statement, saying, “That reminds me of something that happened to me one time…” Making small talk is a way of sharing general information with another person as a means to learn what you might have in common. For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths.  Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides. You’ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note. One of the things you’ll have in common with everyone else at the party is that you’re both there. Perhaps you all had to battle traffic to get to the party. Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations.  Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you’ve always hated evening gatherings. You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also. When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say.  Try to avoid talking over the other person while she’s talking, even if she’s talking about a topic you’re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little. Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet.  For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged. Change the topic back to them with a question or find another person you haven't yet introduced yourself to. gracefully. Conversations at parties start and end rapidly, and if you’re talking with someone you’ve just met, it’s a good idea not to keep the conversation going on too long.  Have an excuse prepared for needing to leave. This is a time when it’s okay not to tell the truth. You can always say, “I have to get up early tomorrow,” or even just, “Please, excuse me. I need to find the ladies’.” You can say, “It was nice to meet you,” or “Great talking to you!” Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal. If you like, you can include an excuse for breaking off the conversation. For example, you can say, “I don’t want to dominate your evening,” or “I should probably let you talk to other people here.”","output":"This article gives tips for making a good impression at parties, including introducing yourself, giving compliments, avoiding controversial topics, making small talk, being observant of body language, and knowing when to end a conversation gracefully."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices.   Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day. Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time. . Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on.  Tell someone (or everyone) that you're dieting.  Making a public declaration can increase your chances of success by holding you accountable to others.  It can also engender the support you need from family members and friends who can cheer you on to your goal. Join a support group.  This could be formal group such as Weight Watchers or simply a group you organize yourself.  Post an ad on Craigslist looking for weight-loss partners or organize or join a Meetup group dedicated to healthier eating. Post inspirational sayings on your fridge.  Having mood-boosting words-of-wisdom close at hand can help you handle a difficult diet day. Do things that make you feel good.  Get a pedicure, have your hair done, buy a new perfume.  Little things that make you feel special and pampered can offset the feeling of deprivation that can sometimes creep in when you're dieting. Summary:","output":"Positive thinking is important when you want to eat healthy and exercise. Thinking happy thoughts helps you feel motivated and energetic. It is not good to feel sad or angry with yourself if you eat something unhealthy, just try again the next day. Be kind to yourself and tell yourself nice things when you look in the mirror.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you want to have a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, then one of the most important things you have to do is let her know how much you care about her. Tell her you love her, give her meaningful compliments, spend time with her, plan romantic dates, and always let her know how lucky you are. Don’t ever take her for granted or she may feel like she can’t trust you because you’re losing interest.  You don’t have to smother her with hugs and kisses all the time, especially if that’s not your thing. However, you have to find a way to let her know you care every time you’re together. Getting her a meaningful gift just because, instead of because it’s Valentine’s Day or her birthday, can really show her that she matters to you. It’s the thought that counts, not the price tag. Write her love letters to surprise her when she’s having a bad day. If you do this when she least expects it, she’ll be charmed. If you really want to continue a serious relationship with this girl and to make her trust you, then you have to be able to compromise with her. Let her see that you don’t always need to get your way and that you want her to be happy, too. Even if you’re working on winning back her trust, you don’t have to completely give in to her every single time, or she’ll think you don’t have a backbone. Instead, work on having productive conversations that weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and on finding a way that can make both of you happy.  She’ll see that she can trust you if it looks like you really take her thoughts and feelings into account instead of just always wanting to get your way. Sometimes, you should just give in and let her see the movie she wants to see or go to the restaurant she’s been craving; this is okay as long as sometimes, she gives in to you as well. You may think that, if you want the girl to trust you, that you have to be Mr. Perfect all the time, and that you can’t possibly ever disappoint her. While you should be loyal and reliable, you shouldn’t put too much pressure on yourself to be absolutely perfect. Make an effort to be the best person you can be, and she’ll feel like she can really trust you because of it. That said, this is no excuse for cheating. Cheating is never acceptable.  If you show up late to a date, just apologize and show her how sorry you are. As long as you don’t make a habit of it, she’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to admit you made a mistake. You should also be okay with saying, “I don’t know”. You don’t always have to act like you know exactly what to do if you want her to trust you. In fact, she may be even more eager to trust you if she knows you’re honest about your feelings. Another thing you can do to make her trust you is to be open about your feelings. Let her see that you want to confide in her, to be frank with her, and that you’re willing to tear down those walls for her. While you don’t have to reveal every single secret you have to her, you should work on being open and honest when you’re talking to her, whether you’re telling her what you did this past weekend or you’re talking about your concerns about your college major. If you’re open on a regular basis, she’ll see that she’s able to trust you in the long term.  If something is troubling you, you should be comfortable enough to open up to her about it, even if it’s a little bit embarrassing or you worry it’ll make her think less of you. If you never tell her about your problems, then she’ll feel like she should never open up to you, either. If you’re having a bad day, you can be honest with her about it, explaining what’s going on. You don’t want her to think you have to hide everything from her. If you hide things from her, then she’ll hide things from you, too. To maintain a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, you have to be open and willing to communicate with her. You can’t brush her off every time she wants to have a talk, and you have to make her feel comfortable with bringing up issues to you. When she talks to you, make sure you’re open to having a conversation and that you really stop and listen. If you have something to say to her, don’t put it off or be passive aggressive instead of hashing it out.  Communication is key in any healthy relationship. If you want the girl to trust you in the long run, then you have to make her feel like you’re open to talking about your relationship and sharing your feelings with her. If she feels scared about sharing her feelings with you because she thinks you’ll be angry or dismissive, then she won’t be able to really trust you. If you want to make your relationship with the girl work and really want her to trust you, then you have to be able to make time for her and to show her that she’s a priority. If you spend too much time with your buddies or don’t answer your phone for hours, then she’s likely to not trust you because she won’t know what you’re doing when you’re not around. Make an effort to be there for her, to have a regular hangout routine, and to let her know what you’re doing when you’re not together. Putting in a time commitment is essential to making her trust you.  If you know you won’t have your phone on for a few hours, because you’ll be in a long meeting or watching a movie, you can text her before to say hi and let her know what’s up. Of course, you don’t have to be accountable for every minute of your life and that can get exhausting, but letting her generally know how you spend your time can really help her trust you. Making time for her shows that she’s central to your life. This is crucial for making her trust and believe in you.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of building trust in a meaningful relationship with a girl through open communication, showing care and affection, valuing her thoughts and feelings, being open about one's own emotions, admitting mistakes, being reliable without aiming for perfection, spending time together, and making her a priority in one's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Les Diaboliques Movie plot: The story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. Christina hears some noises and wanders the school. She concludes that someone is in the school and she runs back to her room. She finds Michel's corpse in the bathtub.

Here is a news article: The United Nations observer mission in Syria will expire this weekend and will not be extended, France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud, told reporters Thursday.      The news comes as the Syrian government pounded the country's largest city Thursday, using aerial forces to shell neighborhoods and intensifying the siege that has become a focal point of the country's civil war.      CNN inside Syria: Nobody imagined it would turn into this      Meanwhile, in neighboring Lebanon, another person was kidnapped in an incident believed to be linked to the violence in Syria.      At least 158 new deaths were reported across Syria on Thursday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria. The deaths include 50 in Aleppo.      They also include 60 unidentified bodies found in Qatana, a Damascas suburb, the LCC said. The bodies, found in a landfill, \\"seem to have been executed in a massacre by the regime's army,\\" the group said.      At least eight people were killed and more than 50 wounded when shells struck near an Aleppo bakery where people had lined up to buy bread, said Ahmad al-Zaeem, a commander in the rebel Free Syrian Army. At least 150 people have been wounded in the latest violence in Aleppo, he said. ||||| The Security Council will let the U.N. military observer mission's mandate in Syria expire Sunday and will back a new civilian office there to support U.N. and Arab League efforts to end the country's 18-month conflict.      France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud, the current Security Council president, said Thursday that members agreed to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposal for a liaison office.      Araud said the council agreed that conditions set for possibly extending the mission of the unarmed observers past Sunday were not met. He says there was no halt to the Syrian government's use of heavy weapons and no significant reduction in violence.      Russia invited U.N. ambassadors from key world powers that met in Geneva in June and agreed on guidelines for a political transition in Syria to meet in New York on Friday and call on all sides to end the violence.      \\"More than 18,000 people have been killed during the last 18 months,\\" Ban told reporters in East Timor on Wednesday. \\"The Syrian people have suffered too much too long.\\"      In a letter to the council last Friday, Ban said, \\"it is imperative for the United Nations to have a presence in Syria\\" aside from its humanitarian operation in order to support U.N. and Arab League efforts \\"in mediating and facilitating a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\\"      The Security Council initially authorized the 300-strong observer mission to deploy to Syria for 90 days to monitor implementation of a six-point peace plan brokered by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. The plan was to start with a cease-fire and withdrawal of the government's heavy weapons and culminate with Syrian-led political talks.      Assad's government and opposition forces agreed to the plan, but it was never implemented.      Because of the worsening bloodshed and insecurity, the observers have been mainly confined to their hotels since June 15, and their numbers have been cut by about two-thirds. The U.N. said Wednesday that 110 observers remain in Syria, mainly in Damascus. A bomb exploded Wednesday outside their hotel, wounding three people, but no observers were hurt.      Frustrated at the escalating conflict and the failure of world powers on the Security Council to unite to stop the chaos, Annan announced last month that he was resigning effective Aug. 31.      Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed Security Council resolutions that would have stepped up pressure especially against the Syrian government by threatening sanctions if the fighting didn't stop. ||||| A powerful Shiite Muslim clan in Lebanon on Thursday claimed to have abducted more Syrian nationals and vowed further kidnappings in retaliation for the seizure of a family member by rebels in Syria this week, as Syria's civil war threatened to break open violent rivalries in its neighbor Lebanon.

Masked Lebanese believed to be from... (Associated Press)      The wave of kidnappings raises the dire scenario that the battle for control over Syria will ignite tensions in Lebanon, a country with its own history of civil war, an explosive sectarian mix and deep divisions between pro- and anti-Syrian factions _ many of them armed.      Already, the abductions have brought gunmen from both the Shiite and Sunni communities into the streets. On Wednesday, Shiite supporters of the al-Mikdad clan went on a rampage in a Beirut neighborhood, vandalizing dozens of Syrian-run stores, and then blocked the road to the airport, setting tires on fire and wandering the road with guns. Travelers were forced to walk from their cars to the airport, and at least one flight was cancelled. The road was only reopened early Thursday morning.      The tensions emerged Thursday in the eastern Bekaa Valley, near the Syrian border. Masked men believed to be from the Bekaa town of Majdal Anjar _ a Sunni stronghold _ burned tires and set up roadblocks on the main highway leading to the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. They stopped cars going either way and checked passengers' IDs before deciding whether to let them pass, apparently looking for Shiites or Mikdad supporters.      In the nearby town of Chtoura, four gunmen abducted Syrian businessman Hossam Khasroum, pulling him from his car as he was driving and taking him to an unknown location, security officials said. Khasroum, the offficials said, is known to be a support of Assad's regime.      In a separate incident, gunmen attacked a car driven by pro-Syrian Lebanese politician, Joseph Abu-Fadel, breaking his car windows with stones as he was driving to Syria. He and three others were lightly injured.      On Wednesday, armed members of the al-Mikdad clan said they had kidnapped more than 20 Syrian nationals and a Turk in Lebanon in retaliation for the abduction of their relative, Hassane Salim al-Mikdad, who was captured in Syria this week.      Rebels who kidnapped al-Mikdad claimed he was a member of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, a staunch supporter of President Bashar Assad's regime. Hezbollah and his family deny this.      Maher al-Mikdad, a family spokesman, warned on Thursday that \\"if anything happens to Hassane, we will kill the Turkish hostage we have and many others. But we will start with the Turks.\\"      Speaking to The Associated Press, he said the clan has snatched more Syrians and warned that it would go on with further kidnappings until their clansman is released. He could not give an exact number but said the clan was now holding more than 20 captives.      Lebanon's government appeared largely unable or unwilling to stop the kidnapping spree and escalating violence. Hezbollah and its allies hold a majority in the Cabinet, which has adopted a policy of \\"disassociation\\" from the events in Syria, trying to remain neutral. Hezbollah critics say it is assisting Assad in moving the conflict to Lebanon to divert attention from the deadly civil war raging in Syria.      The al-Mikdad family is a powerful Shiite Muslim clan that originally comes from the eastern Bekaa Valley, an area where state control is limited and revenge killings are common. Like most tribes in this area, they have their own militia, and security officials say many of its members are outlaws wanted on arrest warrants. The family reach also extends to the capital.      A south Beirut neighborhood with strong al-Mikdad ties, Rweis, is often avoided by outsiders who fear any possible offense that could put them at odds with the clan. The al-Mikdad's power often put them at odds with Hezbollah, the main power broker in the area, although many observers believe the appearance of armed groups Wednesday claiming to be members of the \\"military wing\\" of al-Mikdad family could not have happened without at least tacit Hezbollah support.      The wave of hostage-taking prompted Gulf countries to call on all their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately. Sunni regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who back the Syrian rebels, were the first, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. Lebanon is a popular summer destination for Gulf residents trying to escape the searing heat.      Al-Mikdad backed off an earlier threat to abduct Gulf nationals. He said Thursday that only Syrians and Turks would be targeted.      \\"Our problem is with the Syrians who have abducted our son and Syrian opponents of the region,\\" he said. \\"And why Turkey? Because Turkey is an operation theater for the Free Syrian Army,\\" he added.      Turkey shelters thousands of Syrian refugees along with the leadership and members of the Free Syrian Army rebel group.      The conflict in Syria has a sharply sectarian tone. The rebels are predominantly Sunni, whereas President Bashar Assad and his inner circle come mainly from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiism. Similarly, Lebanon has had long rivalries between its own Sunni and Shiite communities. Throughout Syria's conflict, Lebanese Sunnis have largely been sympathetic to the Syrian rebellion, while Hezbollah _ the main Shiite political power _ has backed Assad. ||||| Launch Gallery Expand A residential area in Azaz, hit by at least two bombs from a Syrian fighter jet on August 15, 2012. © 2012 Rachel Beth Anderson for Human Rights Watch      (Azaz) – A Syrian government fighter jet bombed a residential neighborhood, killing more than 40 civilians and wounding at least 100 others in the town of Azaz, including many women and children, Human Rights Watch said today after visiting the town. In the attack on August 15, 2012, at least two bombs destroyed an entire block of houses in the al-Hara al-Kablie neighborhood of Azaz, in Syria’s northern Aleppo province.      Human Rights Watch investigated the site of the bombing two hours after the attack and interviewed witnesses, victims, medical personnel, and relatives of those killed.      “This horrific attack killed and wounded scores of civilians and destroyed a whole residential block,” said Anna Neistat, acting emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. “Yet again, Syrian government forces attacked with callous disregard for civilian life.”      Azaz residents told Human Rights Watch that, at around 3 p.m., they saw a fighter jet drop at least two bombs on the residential area. Within seconds, dozens of houses in an area of approximately 70-by-70 meters – more than half a football field – were flattened. Houses on the surrounding streets were significantly damaged, with collapsed walls and ceilings. On the streets around the bombed area, windows were broken and some walls had collapsed.      Two opposition Free Syrian Army facilities in the vicinity of the attack might have been targets of the Syrian aircraft, Human Rights Watch said. One was the headquarters of the local Free Syrian Army brigade, in the former building of the Baath party, two streets away from the block that was hit. The other was a detention facility where the Free Syrian Army held “security detainees” – government military personnel and members of pro-government shabeeha militia. Neither of these facilities was damaged in the attack.      Rescuers used two bulldozers to retrieve the dead and wounded from the ruins. By 7 p.m., medical personnel at the scene said they had recovered 25 bodies, and were looking for more in the rubble. A man helping to bury the bodies said that by midnight 33 people had been buried in Azaz.      The exact number of victims is difficult to verify. Most of the wounded were transported to hospitals across the nearby Turkish border. A hospital volunteer in the Turkish town of Kilis, about 20 kilometers north of Azaz, told Human Rights Watch that 61 wounded people from Azaz had been brought to the hospital, and another 13 people had died either on the way to Kilis or shortly after arrival, among them seven men, two women and four children. At least another 16 severely wounded people were brought to a hospital in the Turkish town of Gaziantep, about 80 kilometers from Azaz, a doctor in that hospital told Human Rights Watch.      One Azaz resident, “Ahmed,” told Human Rights Watch that the bombing had killed at least 12 members of his family in their home. He believed that four other family members were still under the ruins. He said:      I was about 100 meters away from the house when I saw the airplane and heard the sound of the bombing and destruction. My three brothers lived here. I buried 12 of my family members today, including my father, my mother, and my sister – my brother’s wife as well. Walid, my brother, was cut into pieces. We didn’t recognize him at first. We buried my brothers’ children also. The youngest was 40 days old.      “Ali” was weeping on the ruins of his house. He told Human Rights Watch:      I was on the roof, making tomato soup, when I suddenly heard the plane. I heard several loud bangs, and was thrown to the floor. When I got up, I saw my wife who was injured – hit in the chest by shrapnel or debris. She was taken to the hospital – I still do not know what happened to her.      “Ayman” told Human Rights Watch:      My brother, sister and my father’s wife were killed today. What was Bashar al-Assad looking for in this area? …There were no weapons here. I live far away from my family, but when I heard the sounds of the explosion I came here and saw all this destruction. I was here when they removed the bodies of my family from under the rubble. Two of my killed relatives were 9 and 6 years old.      International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, applies to all Syrian government and armed opposition forces in Syria. The laws of war prohibit direct attacks on civilians. Homes, apartments, and other civilian structures are also to be protected from attack, unless they are being used for military purposes. Where there is doubt about whether a target is military or civilian, it must be presumed to be civilian.      The laws of war also prohibit attacks that strike military targets and civilians indiscriminately, such as those that are not directedat a specific military target.Attacks are also prohibited that may be expected to cause incidental civilian loss that would be disproportionate to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the attack.      Military commanders must choose the means of attack that can be directed at military targets and will minimize incidental harm to civilians. If the weapons used are so inaccurate that they cannot be directed at military targets without imposing a substantial risk of civilian harm, then they should not be deployed. Weapons, such as aerial bombs with a large blast radius may be considered indiscriminate when used in populated areas.      The laws of war do not prohibit fighting in urban areas, although the presence of many civilians places greater obligations on all warring parties to take steps to minimize harm to civilians. All forces need to take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian population, and take all feasible precautions to avoid loss of civilian life and property. These precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military targets and not civilians or civilian objects, and giving \\"effective advance warning\\" of attacks when circumstances permit.      All forces must also avoid deploying near densely populated areas, and strive to remove civilians from the vicinity of their forces. At the same time, attacking forces are not relieved from their obligation to take into account the risk to civilians simply because they consider the defending forces responsible for locating military targets within populated areas.      Governments have an obligation to investigate allegations of serious laws-of-war violations by their military forces. Those committed with criminal intent – deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Governments are obligated to identify and prosecute the individuals responsible for war crimes according to international fair-trial standards.      Human Rights Watch called on United Nations Security Council members to impose an arms embargo on the Syrian government and targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for abuses, and refer the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court.      “Syrian forces in northern Aleppo are using heavy artillery and aerial bombing in populated areas that kill and maim civilians every day,” Neistat said. “All Security Council members should show that protection of civilians means more than empty words.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The United Nations observer mission in Syria is set to expire and will not be extended, according to France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud.

I would rate it 3 stars out of 5, as it delivers a decent experience, but also has some areas that could use some enhancement. On the positive side, the app does a fairly good job of emulating PSP games, providing a nostalgic experience for fans of the console. The interface is user-friendly, allowing gamers to navigate quickly with minimal fuss. Plus, the app's compatibility with various games is impressive, which means users have a diverse library to choose from. However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I encountered while using the app. Firstly, I noticed the sound and graphics quality was not always up to par, compromising the overall gaming experience. Some games were even quite laggy, making it challenging to play them smoothly. Additionally, while the app is free, the presence of ads can be quite intrusive and distracting while engaging in gameplay. I understand the need for ad revenue, but I feel there could be a better balance to ensure the ads are not too disruptive. In conclusion, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is a satisfactory choice for PSP emulation, but it falls short in some aspects, such as sound and graphic quality, and the intrusive ads. With some improvements, I believe this app has the potential to become a top-notch emulator. For now, it earns a solid 3 stars in my book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers. Answer:","output":"Loons, diving ducks, penguins, and auks are swimming birds that eat fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Understand the premise. The premise is stating that George Orwell and Lionel Trilling have been reclaimed as revolutionary heroes. Step 2: Consider the hypothesis. The hypothesis is stating that George Orwell and Lionel Trilling are not to us revolutionary heroes. Step 3: Compare the statements. The premise and the hypothesis are making contradictory statements about the same subject - George Orwell and Lionel Trilling being revolutionary heroes. Step 4: Conclusion. For the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, it would need to logically follow from or be a necessary conclusion of the premise. In this case, the hypothesis is stating exactly the opposite of the premise. So, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In other words, the premise does not logically imply or necessitate the hypothesis.

But fans -- or \\"Marshmallows\\" as they're known -- wouldn't let executives keep their beloved characters from them a second time and saved the project by donating more than 5.7 million to a Kickstarter campaign for the film earlier this year, reaching far more than the 2 million Warner Bros. required to make the movie.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators?  Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"Based on the description and hint provided, Liam, who focused on reading about apex predators, would have learned more about predators with no natural predators. This is because apex predators are at the top of the food chain and do not have any natural predators preying on them.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

Abstract: PURPOSE Minimal (< 10 mm thick) pleural effusion (PE) may represent an early phase of malignant PE, but its clinical relevance has rarely been studied. Therefore, we examined the proportion of minimal PE in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its impact on survival. We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set.     PATIENTS AND METHODS On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival.     RESULTS Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2% stage I, 10.9% stage II, 13.2% stage IIIA, 23.8% stage IIIB, and 13.9% stage IV. Minimal PE correlated significantly with shorter survival time than did no PE (median survival time, 7.7 v 17.7 months; log-rank P < .001), even after full adjustment with all variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.62). Prognostic impact of minimal PE was higher in early versus advanced stages (Pinteraction = .001). In 237 patients (87.8%) with minimal PE, pleural invasion or attachment as a direct mechanism was observed, and it was an independent factor predicting worse survival (P = .03).     CONCLUSION Minimal PE is a commonly encountered clinical concern in staging NSCLCs. Its presence is an important prognostic factor of worse survival, especially in early-stage disease..

Please write a short summary for the following article: How to set up your new HDTV Geoff Morrison , HD Guru It’s not possible for a TV to be set at the factory with the best settings possible for your home. Take 20 minutes or so on your end, and you can drastically improve the picture quality. If you just bought a TV, or just haven't found the time to mess around with your set, here are tips for doing it right. If you really want to nail it, we suggest a setup Blu-ray. They’re cheap, and the Disney WOW disc is especially helpful and easy to follow. (A step-up from that would be the 30 ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard.) Straight out of the boxAll HDTVs generally have a start-up screen that lets the user to choose between a home mode and a store demo mode. This is extremely important. The store mode is designed to produce the brightest image — at the expense of black level, contrast ratio and energy efficiency. To obtain the best picture select the home mode. You will still be able to make fine-tuning adjustments to maximize image quality. The screen will also ask you to choose your language, and will ask about using over-the-air antenna or cable/satellite. If you don’t use an antenna, make sure you select cable/satellite. You don’t want the TV to go into the tuner mode, because you won't see an image. Special instructions for smart TVsIf your new HDTV has Internet connectivity for streaming movies and other content, the next step should be connecting to the Internet. All smart TVs have an Ethernet connection if you want to wire the TV directly. Many also have Wi-Fi for wireless set-up. Follow the on-screen instructions or the owner’s manual for the proper steps. Once completed, you should make sure you have the latest version of the TV's software, by performing a firmware update as per your TV's instructions. The update may add new features, Internet services and even apps, and will assure you have the latest and best version of your new HDTV. Don't skip this: Nearly every TV we test has newer firmware waiting for it when we connect it to the Internet. Picture modesNearly all TVs have picture modes that adjust multiple settings to create a certain look to the image. The best idea is to start with the most accurate setting, then adjust as you see fit. With nearly all TVs, this mode is called “Movie,” “Cinema,” or something similar. If these aren’t options, “Standard” is likely closest. If you’ve already been watching your TV for more than a few minutes, switching to one of these modes is going to be a shock. It will seem red (warm) and soft. It isn’t, which I’ll explain as we go. ContrastThis control adjusts the bright parts of the image: Clouds, white shirts, snow, etc. The idea is to set this control high enough that the image “pops,” but not so high as to mask detail, like cloud textures or shirt wrinkles. All TVs have a maximum contrast setting, above which you’re not making the image any brighter, you’re just making near-white objects totally white. If you’re using a setup disc, the contrast pattern will have a ramp of progressively whiter bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “above white”). If you’re not using a setup disc, find a TV show (ideally a live sporting event) that takes place outside. Skiing works great for this, though baseball does as well (fly balls, any shot of the sky). The idea is to be able to set the control so that you can still see detail in bright white objects. There should almost never be bright white blobs on the screen. If there are, turn the contrast control down until those blobs get their detail back. There is no average number to use as a guideline for setting contrast, but it’s almost never 100 percent, or anything close. Start somewhere around 80 percent and go from there. BrightnessThis is the opposite of the contrast control. Despite its name, brightness control adjusts the dark parts of the image: Shadows, black hair, black leather jackets. The idea here is to set it low enough that the picture has lots of contrast (as in, the difference in the light and dark parts of the image), but not so far that there’s just huge swaths of blackness on screen during any night scene. If you’re using a setup disc, the brightness pattern will have a ramp of progressively darker black bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “below black” or similar). If you’re setting this by eye, any night or darkly lit scene will do. Set the control fairly low, down past the point where you lose detail. Now gradually increase it until you see detail in the darkness. If the picture looks gray or washed out, you’ve brought your brightness too far up. Color and tintGenerally speaking, you shouldn’t have to adjust these at all. These are holdovers from the old tube (CRT) TV days. With component and HDMI connections, the TV shouldn’t need adjustment to color or tint. But so you know, color is color saturation. Set too high, people will look sunburned, and everything will seem cartoony. Tint adjusts the green/red in the image (Martian/lobster). Without specific color filters (that usually come with setup discs), you can’t adjust either of these settings these correctly. Skip. SharpnessThis is a highly misleading control. Generally speaking, sharpness control adds enhancement to the image to make it appear sharp. Ironically, by doing so, it’s actually masking true fine detail in the image. This setting should be set as low as possible. Some TVs actually soften the image if you set it too low (bizarre, to be sure), so watch out for that. Look for dark lines on a bright background, like the edges of buildings for instance. Lower this setting so there isn’t any ghost line next to the dark edge. This ghost line is called “edge enhancement,” and goes a long way in making the image look artificial. Once you get used to the naturalness of the image without edge enhancement, you’ll never go back. Color temperatureThis one is going to be tough. Not because it requires any labor on your part, it’s just going to do something to the image that at first is going to seem bad. Color temperature is how bluish or reddish the image looks. Picture a typical scene of people walking down a street. Set the color temp too cool, and it will look like they’re walking down the street in winter, with that season’s normal bluish tones. Set the color temp too warm, and it will be a reddish warm day instead. With most TVs, the ideal setting is “warm” or “low.” In some cases, this is too warm, and “normal” is closer. If you’re changing the settings for the first time, and the TV was set in the “cool” color temp mode, everything will look wrong, and even “normal” will appear to your eye as too warm. Give your eyes time to adjust. Watch on “normal” for a few hours, and then “cool” will seem incredibly blue. BacklightThis is an LCD-specific control — plasma TVs don’t have backlights. Think of the backlight setting as a volume control for the image. Turn it up, and the entire picture (bright whites and dark blacks alike) get brighter. Turn it down, and everything gets darker. If you leave this turned all the way up, not only are you wasting energy, but at night your TV can be hard to watch. Modern LCDs are extremely bright, and watching such a small bright object in a dark room can create severe eye fatigue. For critical viewing, or watching at night, the idea is to get the best black levels, while still creating a watchable image. Once you set contrast and brightness correctly, turn the backlight control all the way down. This will likely be too dark for most viewing. Turn it up to the point where it looks the best. Often, at night, this could be as low as 20 percent, depending on the TV. During the day, you can set this as high as you want. Interestingly, no setup disc offers instructions on how to set this control. Read more on this in our buyer-beware article on TV backlights. For more on what your HDTV’s controls do, read our Guide to HDTV Settings. You can catch up with Geoff Morrison on Twitter at @TechWriterGeoff. His novel, \\"Undersea,\\" is now in paperback. Summary:","output":"Setting up a new HDTV requires about 20 minutes of your time to drastically improve picture quality. First, choose the home mode when starting up, connect your smart TV to the internet, check for firmware updates, and select the most accurate picture mode. Then, adjust the contrast control to ensure the image pops while maintaining detail, set brightness low enough to provide contrast without losing detail, and set sharpness as low as possible without softening. Next, adjust the color temperature for natural tones and optimize the backlight depending on whether you mostly watch TV during the day or at night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.

Article: Ceiling fans are very effective because they move the air around the room and create a draft. They also pull air up when circulating it, and since hot air rises, this will help to cool the room down faster. If the ceiling fan isn’t already on in the room, turn it on immediately. If your ceiling fan has settings of low, medium and high, put the fan on the highest setting.  Check the ceiling fan blades to see if they’re rotating counterclockwise (if viewing them from below) – if they aren’t, adjust the settings. Setting the blades to rotate counterclockwise and turning the fan on a higher speed will substantially increase airflow. Table fans, box fans, oscillating fans and mounted fans will all help to contribute to air circulation in the room and create a wind-chill effect. A medium-sized oscillating fan placed on a desktop is very efficient at moving around stagnant hot air quickly. Keep multiple fans set up in the room during the summer so you can turn them on as soon as you walk in. Turn on your bathroom ventilation fan, too. The ventilation fan can help suck hot air out of the room, just as it does when you take a steamy shower. Create a makeshift air conditioner by filling up a shallow pan, tray or mixing bowl with ice and positioning it in front of one of the fans. This will get cold, slightly misty air circulating the room very quickly. You could also use icepacks or, if you’re all out of ice, you can effectively improvise with something similarly cold, like a bag of frozen vegetables. Position the bowl at a slight angle, tilted up, if the fan doesn’t seem to be blowing across the ice effectively. The fan will pull hot air out of the room and transfer it outside. It will also bring in cooler air. Put the fan in the window that gets the most shade – this will provide the coolest intake air. Close any other windows nearby tightly. Open a few windows on the other side of your house. This will create a house-wide draft and cool things down quickly.

Some in the crowd held pictures of victims of the attack, others carried signs reading, \\"Show respect for 9/11. No mosque!\\" The board did not have the power to block the project, but its actions are an important barometer of community sentiment, The New York Times says. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, director of one sponsor of the project, said he understood the anguish but noted that his group condemned the 9/11 attacks, which killed members of his community and congregation as well. \\"We have worked to ensure that our mosques are not recruiting grounds for terrorists,\\" he said. C. Lee Hanson, whose son, Peter, died in the Trade Center, said he opposed the project, not because he was intolerant but because it would be insensitive to build a tribute to Islam so close to Ground Zero. \\"When I look over there and I see a mosque, it's going to hurt,\\" Hanson said, according to The Times. \\"Build it someplace else.\\" To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Fighter ace Major Lloyd \\"Ace\\" Gruver, of the United States Air Force,  the son of a U.S. Army general, is stationed at Itami Air Force Base near Kobe, Japan. He has been reassigned from combat duties in Korea by General Webster, the father of his fiancée, Eileen. Airman Joe Kelly, who is Ace's enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the United States military establishment, which will not recognize the inter-racial marriage. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding. Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace's attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura. When she overhears that Joe's house has been under surveillance by the Army, she believes that Ace is in danger and goes there to warn him, where she realizes he is seeing a local woman. Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of a particularly nasty colonel, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When he and many others who are married to Japanese are targeted for transfer back to the States, Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant. Ace goes to General Webster and pleads Joe's case, asking that he be allowed to remain in Japan.

McDonald's placed this billboard near Starbucks' corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Residents in Seattle, Washington, the birthplace of Starbucks, can now see approximately 140 McDonald's billboards emblazoned with \\"large is the new grande\\" or \\"four bucks is dumb.\\" In a statement released Thursday, McDonald's called it \\"a light-hearted, fun approach to our brand,\\" aimed at promoting the company's McCafe coffee products. However, Starbucks is not finding the ad campaign funny. \\"Comparative campaigns are all well and good but only when they're credible and authentic. If the claim is not supportable or the tone is off, you risk losing credibility,\\" Deb Trevino, director of global communications for Starbucks, told CNN. A 12-ounce cup of coffee at Starbucks in Seattle costs just 1.40, only a penny more than the average price for a same size cup at McDonald's. Credibility is something that Starbucks claims it is not short on. A portion of coffee sales currently goes towards health care for Starbucks' baristas, while another goes towards helping AIDS victims in Africa, according to the company. \\"We will not enter into a tit-for-tat,\\" Trevino said. \\"Our customers are interested in more than just the coffee, they come for the experience.\\" For now, McDonald's said it does not plan to take its \\"four bucks is dumb\\" campaign nationwide.

It said the demands included \\"national security matters\\" among other information. Microsoft and Facebook published similar numbers last week. But Google and Twitter have said that such disclosures are not helpful. \\"We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests,\\" said a statement by Google published on Saturday. \\"Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users.\\" A tweet from Twitter's legal director, Benjamin Lee, added: \\"We agree... it's important to be able to publish numbers of national security requests - including Fisa [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] disclosures - separately.\\" Tech firms have been under pressure to disclose information about data passed to the National Security Agency since The Guardian and Washington Post revealed the existence of Prism - a programme giving the NSA access to user data held on the servers of tech firms including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, and Apple. The NSA later confirmed the existence of the surveillance scheme as well as a separate phone records programme which it said had helped it thwart terrorist plots in the US and more than 20 other countries. US spy chief James Clapper has also stated that the NSA's communications-collection efforts were designed to help acquire information about \\"non-US persons located outside the United States\\" and the agency could not \\"intentionally target any US citizen, any other US person, or anyone located within the United States\\". However, privacy activists and some politicians have raised concerns that the agency's actions still went beyond what was intended under powers granted by the Patriot Act following the 11 September 2001 terror attacks. Following the revelations, several of the tech firms involved said they had asked the US government to allow them to disclose information which would help them address concern about the scale of information that had been handed over. On Friday, Facebook and Microsoft announced they had been given permission to reveal the number of data requests from US officials in aggregate, and Apple has now followed with its own statement. \\"We first heard of the government's 'Prism' program when news organisations asked us about it on June 6,\\" it said. \\"We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer content must get a court order.\\" The firm added that between 1 December 2012 and 31 May 2013 it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from US law enforcement for customer data, involving between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices. It did not say with how many it had complied. It said the \\"common form of request\\" came from police who were investigating crimes such as robberies, trying to find missing children and patients with Alzheimer's disease, or hoping to prevent suicides. It noted that it would not have been able to decode encrypted conversations which took place over its iMessage or Facetime chat software on behalf of the authorities, nor did it store \\"identifiable\\" data related to Apple Map searches or requests made to its voice-controlled Siri service. \\"Regardless of the circumstances, our legal team conducts an evaluation of each request and, only if appropriate, we retrieve and deliver the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities,\\" it added. Apple's disclosure covers a different period from that disclosed by Facebook and Microsoft, which both published data for the last six months of 2012. Microsoft said it received between 6,000 and 7,000 requests from US government agencies affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 customer accounts. Facebook said it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests covering between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts. Google has said that over the course of 2012 it received between zero and 999 National Security Letters - foreign intelligence-related requests from the FBI involving US citizens which are distinct from the agency's investigations into other criminal, civil or administrative matters. However, these do not include other types of national security requests including those involving Fisa. Google said that on 11 June it wrote to the Department of Justice and FBI asking to be allowed to provide a break-out number for all types of national security requests and details about their scope.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife? ?  Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife is Barbirolli.

Make sure that your computer can actually burn DVDs, as older computers may not have the capability. If the AutoPlay window doesn't appear, click the Start menu and select Computer. Right-click on the DVD drive and select \\"Open\\". This can help you identify what's on this disc later. Including the date in the name can help organize your discs. There are two options when it comes to burning a data disc: Live File System or Mastered.  Using the Live File System allows you to add, edit, and delete files on the disc as long as you're using it with other Windows computers. If you select this option, the disc will be formatted before you can start adding files to it. This formatting process may take a few minutes. Mastered finalizes the disc when you're done adding files so that it can't be changed, but will allow you to use the disc in any computer or device that supports data DVDs. Once you've selected your disc format, you can start adding files to the disc. Single-layer DVDs can fit 4.7 GB of data. There are a couple of different ways that you can add files to your blank disc:  Click and drag files into the blank DVD's window. Right-click on a file or folder and select \\"Send to\\" and then your disc drive. If you're using the Live File System format, the files will be burned to the disc as soon as you copy them. This may take a few moments for larger files. When you're done adding files to your disc, you can finish the process by either closing the session (Live File System) or by burning the disc (Mastered).  Live File System - Click the Close session button at the top of the disc's window. This will finalize the disc which allows you to continue using it like a USB drive in other Windows computers. Mastered - Click the Burn to disc button at the top of the disc's window. You'll be given the opportunity to name the disc again and select your recording speed. The burn process may take several minutes to complete. At the end of the burning process, you'll be given the opportunity to burn the same data to another blank disc if you need copies. You can continue to add files to your burned DVDs as long as there is still free space available. You can do this regardless of which format you created the disc in. Follow the processes above to add more files.  Live File System - Every time you open a new session on a disc, you lose about 20 MB of usable space. Mastered - Files added to an already-burned disc cannot be deleted. DVD-RW discs are rewritable, and can be erased even if you chose the Mastered format. To erase the disc, insert it and open Windows Explorer. Select your DVD-RW in your list of devices, but don't open it. Click the Erase this disc button at the top of the window.

I had to show them I wasn't crazy.

I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went.

Write an article based on this summary: A £10m online health project has reached less than a third of the people it set out to, the BBC has learned.","output":"Title: £10m Online Health Project Falls Short in Reaching Target Audience Introduction: A £10 million online health project, funded by the UK government, aimed at providing support and resources for individuals seeking medical and wellness information, has so far proven to be less effective than initially anticipated. According to data obtained by the BBC, the reach of the project has been significantly lower than its goals, having reached less than 30% of its intended audience. This raises questions about the project's implementation, marketing strategies, and the allocation of funds. Background: The digital health project, launched last year, was designed as a comprehensive online platform to provide quick access to reliable health information, expert advice, and tools that could improve the well-being and self-care of people in the UK. The project set out to reach millions of users and sought to help them make informed decisions about their health by providing critical information on various health conditions, treatment options, and prevention techniques. Findings: Despite the £10m investment, it has been revealed that the online health project has only managed to reach around 30% of its target audience. This disappointing result indicates a need to re-evaluate the project's strategies and potentially make adjustments to the way resources are utilised. Possible Causes: Several factors may have contributed to the project's low reach: 1. Insufficient marketing: The project may have suffered from poor visibility, as adequate marketing efforts may not have been put in place to educate the public about the platform and its goals. Inadequate marketing can reduce the chances of reaching a wider audience. 2. Inaccessible content: The project's content may not have been user-friendly, or it may have contained too much medical jargon, discouraging users from engaging with the platform. Accessible content design is essential to ensure the message reaches both medical professionals and laypeople. 3. Competition from established platforms: The online health project may have struggled to penetrate a crowded market with existing, well-established information sources. Without offering a clear and compelling differentiator, the project may have failed to attract users away from familiar platforms. Recommendations: Going forward, the following steps could potentially improve the reach of the project: 1. Review and enhance marketing strategies: Implementing a stronger marketing campaign can improve the project's visibility and awareness in its target population. This may include partnerships with health organizations, collaborations with public figures, and focusing on targeted marketing techniques. 2. Make content more accessible: Ensuring that the platform's content is approachable and easy to understand can help attract a wider audience. Utilising infographics, videos, and simplified language are some ways to make information more appealing. 3. Establish a unique selling proposition (USP): To compete more effectively with existing platforms, the project should focus on providing features or services that are distinct and offer an advantage over the competition. Identifying the needs and gaps in the current market can offer valuable insight for creating a USP. Conclusion: While the £10m online health project has not reached its intended audience as expected, there is still potential for improvement. By evaluating current strategies and making necessary adjustments, the project can heighten its appeal and accessibility to ultimately fulfil its intended purpose of providing vital health information and support to millions of individuals in the UK."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F.

To do this, we'll first move the constant term (+84) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. 12*h + 84 - 84 = 0 - 84 12*h = -84 Step 3: Solve for h. To completely isolate h, we now need to divide both sides of the equation by 12, which is the coefficient of h.

Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Shallow farm, which used organic methods combined with permaculture methods, contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water. This is because Bold farm used lots of fertilizers, which, when carried away by rain and runoff, can lead to an increase in nitrogen in the water and eventually cause algae blooms.

This will give us: -443 - 133 = 64*z + 133 - 133 Simplify both sides: -576 = 64*z Step 2: Divide both sides by 64 Next, we want to isolate z on one side of the equation, which requires dividing both sides by 64: -576 / 64 = (64*z) / 64 Simplify both sides: -9 = z So, the solution for the equation -443 = 64*z + 133 for the variable z is z = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is hungry for a hit. He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and now asks for input on his play. Sidney suggests that he murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Bergman.  for the following movie plot:  A prologue establishes the courage and journalistic integrity of Bergman (Pacino) and Mike Wallace (Plummer) as they prepare to interview Sheikh Fadlallah for 60 Minutes. In Louisville, Kentucky, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) arrives home from his office at the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company, reluctantly telling his wife Liane (Venora) that he has been fired. Bergman approaches Wigand for help translating technical documents. Wigand agrees, but Bergman is intrigued when he cites a corporate confidentiality agreement and refuses to discuss anything further. Wigand is later summoned to a meeting with the B&amp;W CEO, who threatens legal action and cessation of severance benefits if he does not sign a more restrictive confidentiality agreement. Wigand angrily leaves, and accuses Bergman of betraying him. Bergman visits Wigand's home and vigorously defends himself. Wigand is reassured but hesitant to reveal anything that might threaten his family's medical coverage, apparently possessing very damaging information. The Wigand family move into a more modest house, Wigand now working as a teacher. One night his younger daughter Barbara sees someone outside. Wigand finds a fresh footprint in the garden, and receives a sinister phone call. Knowing that Wigand's confidentiality agreement obstructs any potential story, Bergman contacts Richard Scruggs (Feore), an attorney representing the State of Mississippi in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, believing that Wigand could be shielded from legal sanction if he were compelled to break confidentiality and testify. Scruggs expresses interest. Some time later Wigand receives an emailed death threat against him and his family, and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the FBI, but the agents who attend are hostile, confiscating his computer. Wigand, furious over the threats, demands Bergman arrange an interview.

At the heart of the maelstrom that has gripped Pakistan during the past eight weeks since I authored an opinion piece on the nuclear-armed nation's alleged intelligence sector malfeasance against U.S. regional interests lies nothing less than the struggle to define Pakistan's modern statehood. It is a fight between the feudal politics of Pakistan's barons, President Asif Ali Zardari being chief among them, and the military's dominance of its industry, security and strategic sectors. Stuck in the middle is a largely uneducated, underemployed and malnourished population that yearns for leadership -- any kind of leadership -- to guide the country forward. That struggle, hidden from the world's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule, has now come out in the open as a result of my column's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that Pakistan's then ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, directed me to draft and deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. [Editor's note: Haqqani has denied any involvement in the memo.]. Inadvertent as my purpose was in disclosing the memorandum, the debate it has touched off is real and the issues being debated are finally the ones that need illumination in a country that survives on a rich diet of conspiracy theories and the adolescent antics of its political leaders. The memorandum called on Mullen to dissuade his friend, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed Operation Neptune Spear -- the U.S. Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In return, it offered a commitment by a reconstituted civilian government, which would have added national security muscle previously belonging to the army and intelligence sectors, to do a lot of what America and its allies in the region, India and Afghanistan, have long been calling on Pakistan to do. To some in Pakistan, the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant (Haqqani) attempting to save his boss's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise. To others, the memorandum's contents were nothing short of high treason, the product of a ruthless operator's (Zardari) directive and his cunning collaborator's (Haqqani) compliance. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yet far from harming the democratic institutions Haqqani claimed to be defending when he first contacted me on that beautiful May morning, the debate over the memorandum's who, what, when and why has had the remarkable effect of stimulating forces that make democracy real in a civilized society, not the mirage that was being peddled around the halls of Congress, Washington's think-tank lecture circuit or the Sunday talk shows by the able ambassador. Today, nearly two months after the memorandum's contents became known, the army remains in its barracks. The intelligence services continue to play their Patriot Games in Afghanistan while minding the store at home with an invisible hand. Zardari, who said he would address a special joint session of Parliament on \\"memogate\\" sometime next week, had his heart condition resurface on Tuesday, sending him scurrying off to Dubai (Pakistani doctors and hospitals wouldn't do) for a stay of undetermined length outside the country. The Supreme Court has taken on the challenge addressed to it by a leader of an opposition political party who felt he couldn't get the \\"memogate\\" truth out of a biased Parliamentary committee. An Inquiry Commission has been formed as a result. A former cricket hero turned politician now routinely attracts tens of thousands of supporters at gathering points around the country as he tries to coerce the Arab Spring's winds to blow further east. And the chivalrous prime minister, Yousef Raza Gilani, tells his party loyalists that he is prepared to resign if my facts are proven right and Haqqani, or worse, Zardari, are found to be the minds behind the memo. Pakistan's press is also doing its job well -- the hacks who support Zardari, Inc. are throwing knives at me hourly while those who want to see Zardari get his comeuppance will simply not let the story go and are eagerly digging at and reporting on every facet of it. All of which means everyone -- finally -- has a stake in the outcome of an issue that could have brought serious repercussions to the country's method of accountability and governance if the doctrine outlined in the memo had been enacted. Hmmm...... seems to me that democracy is doing exactly what it should: Self-corrective actions with heated debate about principled issues, all within the constitutional framework and rule of law as it exists today. David Frum can call me all the names he wants -- it won't change the facts. It certainly will not deter me. And it won't help to fix what ails Pakistan. Peter Bergen can ridicule my three or four claims that turned out to be inaccurate over a five year period of being interviewed nearly four or five times a week -- it won't change the facts, or the accuracy with which I recorded them in this instance. The think-tank crowd and my detractors at the State Department, never ones to like private US citizens running off and doing what they only talk about or dream of being able to do, have always pilloried my efforts -- but their frustrations and jealousies won't change the facts. Even the White House didn't have all the facts when it issued a denial of my opinion that Pakistani officials knew about the bin Laden raid before it happened. Its fact checkers could not readily find the May 2, 2011 story from CNN reporter Nick Paton Walsh which reported that Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK had said -- when asked about the bin Laden raid -- that Pakistan was \\"in the know of certain things\\" and \\"what happened happened with our consent.\\" [Editor's note: Haqqani has been quoted as saying the allegation that he was informed of the raid in advance are \\"reckless, baseless and false.\\"]. I have largely ignored the attacks emanating from Haqqani's supporters in Washington because the former ambassador can't speak for himself since being put on ice by Zardari in a safe house. But enough is enough. Haqqani should be offered immunity from prosecution in Pakistan and simply tell the Pakistani people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did. He will be seen as a hero for having the guts to call a spade a spade. Rogue operations inside governments have no place in our world today. The people of Pakistan deserve better. They deserve to know the truth. And it is alone for the Pakistani people to decide whether their political leaders deserve their faith and trust after learning the truth of what has been done in their names. I did not ask to be involved in the events that gave rise to this firestorm. I too face threats and haranguing from Zardari's supporters on a daily basis. But I had the courage to speak truth to power -- as I have done all my life -- and now I'm going to make sure the facts of what the ambassador and those behind him asked me to do in the name of democracy are put squarely on the table for the people of Pakistan to see, judge and decide. Facts, after all, are still stubborn things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.

I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice. Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay. This film was crap in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. The women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in.

People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally.  Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.

Title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland.

California's drought is proving deadly to the state's trees California’s drought has drained lakes, caused land to subside and forced the state to enact draconian water rules. Now, a new study find the years of little or no rain is taking a heavy toll on the state’s forests. The researchers at Stanford University’s Carnegie Institution for Science concluded that up to 58 million large trees in California experienced water loss that could be life threatening since 2011 due to the state's historic drought. Coupled with higher temperatures and insect outbreaks including from the destructive bark beetle, the drought is increasing the risk of the trees dying that would usher in widespread changes in these ecosystems. Related: When the wells run dry: California drought forcing some families to live in 'Third-World-type conditions \\"California relies on its forests for water provisioning and carbon storage, as well as timber products, tourism, and recreation, so they are tremendously important ecologically, economically, and culturally,\\" Carnegie’s Gregory Asner, a lead author on the study that appeared in the in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"The drought put the forests in tremendous peril, a situation that may cause long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.\\" The team's advanced tools showed that about 41,000 square miles of forest containing up to 888 million large trees experienced measurable change in the amount of water stored in the canopy of the trees between 2011 and 2015. Of this group, up to 58 million large trees covering 3,861 square miles reached water loss thresholds that the scientists deemed extremely threatening to long-term forest health. To get an accurate picture of the tree’s health, Asner and his team used the laser-guided, imaging spectrometer – to measure the mass of the water in the canopy – that was mounted on the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO). They combined the data from the CAO, which is directed by Asner, with traditional satellite data going back to 2011. Related: California drought could doom endangered fish caught in the center of state's water battles \\"The Carnegie Airborne Observatory's research provides invaluable insight into the severity of drought impacts in California's iconic forests. It will be important to bring their cutting-edge data and expertise to bear as the state seeks to address the effects of this epidemic of dying trees and aid in the recovery of our forests,\\" Ashley Conrad-Saydah, deputy secretary for climate policy at the California Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement. Anthony Ambrose, a tree biologist at UC Berkeley who did not participate in the study but has researched the impact of the drought on giant sequoias, said the latest findings are “significant because it's the first to utilize high-resolution airborne data to assess and map forest conditions throughout the entire state.” Related: Historic California drought stressing Giant Sequoias, scientists say “The study documents substantial decreases in canopy water content over time,” he told FoxNews.com by email. “The current drought in California has contributed to substantial tree mortality, a trend that will certainly continue into the future. Increasing temperatures will continue to stress trees and forests of the state in the future, and having the ability to periodically monitor forest conditions over large spatial scales is important,” he said. “This information will be extremely useful for both public and private forestland managers in their decision-making process, e.g., for prioritizing areas for prescribed fire or mechanical thinning to reduce competition for water and decrease fire risk.” So far, the hardest hit tree species have been pine including sugar pine and certain types of oaks. Giant Sequoias are doing fine, Asner said, while their research found a mixed picture for coastal redwoods – some south of San Francisco have fared poorly while those in Northern California are doing better Related: Monster El Nino expected to shape this winter's weather “If we have recurring drought and it comes back strong after the El Nino, we predict we are going to have a lot more tree mortality,” Asner said of the weather pattern which is expected to be one of the strongest of its kind in history and bring much needed rain to California in the coming months. “If drought persists and we lose forest, it will be replaced with something. Typically when forests get too dry and they die off, usually shrub lands and grasslands do the replacing,” he said. “That means a major shift in the biodiversity of the system because there are a lot of species that live in forest and not in shrub lands or grasslands. The whole region could undergo a major shift.” Related: California cuts water use amid drought Not only would many animal species suffer but the state would lose a key source for storing carbon and water from snow packs as well as the economic benefits that come from logging and tourism. Thus, the state is going to have to consider managing these forests much differently, Asner said, including how it fights fires and sets prescribed burns. “There are many issues with losing these forests,” he said. “It isn’t about biodiversity but about water services, carbon sequestration, fire flammability … We can’t stop a drought but the measurements we are making today, the maps we are making today are a key way forward for managers to adjust how they manage these forests.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"California's drought is causing trees in the state to experience heavy water loss, which can be life-threatening to the trees and lead to long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.

Question: I can use this background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision).  Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches.  Answer this question please: Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it is clear that John would be the one to most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. This is because John is described as following the optimal decision-making process, which relies upon comparing the outcomes of different decisions using a defined utility value.  The optimal decision-making process is rooted in decision theory, which is a structured approach to making choices among different options. In John's case, he will strive to make decisions that lead to the best known or expected outcome when compared to all other available decision options (decision A, decision B, and decision C, in this situation). By assigning a utility value to each decision, John is able to quantify the desirability or preference for each outcome and weigh them against one another to identify the optimal choice.  For decision A and decision B, which have certain outcomes, John would be able to directly assess the utility values associated with those outcomes. However, for decision C, which has an uncertain outcome, John would apply the expected utility approach under the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms. This entails calculating a probability-weighted average of utility across all possible outcomes associated with decision C. By doing so, John is able to incorporate the element of uncertainty into his decision-making process, thereby adhering to the principles of the optimal decision-making theory. On the other hand, Keith is described as relying on his hunches, which indicates that he does not follow a structured, logical approach to decision-making but rather bases his choices on intuition or gut feelings. Consequently, it can be inferred that Keith would be less likely to assign a utility value to each decision, as this process would involve a more systematic and analytical approach to determining preferences and weighing alternatives. In conclusion, given the information provided, John would be the one most likely to assign a utility value to each of the decisions in the described situation, due to his adherence to the optimal decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear.","output":"The given sentence, \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's analyze the components of this sentence to understand why it is well-structured and meaningful. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. Examining syntax involves observing grammar, sentence structure, and the use of linguistic elements. The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure: Subject: I Verb: am (the contracted form \\"I'm\\" includes the subject and the verb) Object: as much of a man as you are Furthermore, we can break down the syntax of the sentence into the following key elements: - Clause: \\"I'm as much of a man as you are\\" (where the comparison is made between the subject and object) - Appellation: \\"my dear\\" (a term used to address or refer to someone in an endearing manner) Additionally, the sentence uses the comparative structure \\"as... as\\" to create a clear and accurate comparison between the subjects. In conclusion, the syntax of the sentence is correct and well-structured, making each component understandable and effectively conveying the intended message. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It deals with the interpretation of words, phrases and sentences in context. When evaluating a sentence for semantic acceptability, it is crucial to ensure that the concepts presented are logically coherent and meaningful. In the given sentence, the speaker is using a comparison to make a statement about their own qualities and the qualities of the person they are addressing. In this scenario, \\"as much of a man\\" implies that the speaker possesses equal attributes typically associated with being a man, to the same degree as the person being addressed. The appellation \\"my dear\\" could be interpreted in a variety of contextual ways, such as endearment, sarcasm, or a form of politeness. Nevertheless, this term adds depth to the interpersonal relationship between the speaker and the person being addressed. Semantically, the sentence is acceptable because it conveys a comprehensible and logical meaning. The meaning imbued within the words and phrases work together cohesively, expressing a clear and relevant idea. In summary, the sentence \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable, as it presents a well-formed structure and a coherent, meaningful message. When understood within the context of a conversation or situation, this sentence can engage readers or listeners effectively while maintaining proper syntax and semantics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. Question: How long Paul worked at the company? Options:  A. He just started  B. Few month  C. not enough information  D. About 3 years  === The correct answer is A:","output":"D. About 3 years"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is done to eliminate the constant term (-19) on the right side of the equation: 6 + 19 = -5*j - 19 + 19 25 = -5*j Step 2: Now we have to get rid of the coefficient (-5) of the variable j.

Here is an article: Diego Maradona launched a blistering attack on Sepp Blatter on Monday saying that Fifa had descended into anarchy with the 79-year-old Swiss as president. With the world governing body’s election less than a month away, Maradona, one of the greatest players to ever grace the game and the inspiration behind Argentina’s 1986 World Cup victory, said the time was long overdue for Blatter to go. He said he would do all he could to help Prince Ali bin al-Hussein win the presidency, even though the 39-year-old Jordanian royal hinted on Monday he might consider pulling out of the contest if he thought one of the other two challengers could win. In a syndicated interview with Guillem Balague, the moderator at the Soccerex Asian Forum at the King Hussein convention centre, 60km from Amman, the Jordanian capital, Maradona pulled no punches and gave his backing to the Jordanian royal. Asked why he replied: “If I didn’t believe that he would be a good president, I wouldn’t be here. “As the football world knows, inside Fifa there is total anarchy, where there is only one man who decides everything. “But he knows absolutely nothing. Therefore it is time for a change. And it is so because even his colleagues should actually advise him to leave.“ Maradona, 54, who was voted along with Pelé the joint-best player of the 20th century by Fifa in 2000, said he believed that the continued presence of Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term as president, would harm football. “He has done a lot of damage to football since he has been there. It’s time for him to step aside and let us, who are full of strength, renovate football.“ Maradona played in the World Cups of 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994 and later coached Argentina to the World Cup quarter-finals of 2010. He implied he was unhappy about the way things were done at Fifa, particularly regarding the choice of Russia and Qatar for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals. “First we didn’t know where the World Cup was going to be held. Then we found out that after Brazil it was Russia and then Qatar. “Without any doubt whatsoever Blatter is scared. Blatter is scared. He’s scared of being left out of his share of the cake. “That is what really annoys someone like me, who has played in four World Cups. I was chasing the ball, Blatter is chasing champagne.” Write a title for it.","output":"Diego Maradona Slams Sepp Blatter and Supports Prince Ali for FIFA Presidency Amidst Claims of Anarchy in Governing Body"},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Dimple piercings are fairly risky since you are dealing with an area more prone to infection than most. If done right, though, dimple piercings can partially mimic the look of dimples. Keep the piercings if you want to permanently highlight the dimple area or take them out eventually so that the skin eventually heals, leaving behind a dimple-like indentation.  Due to the risks involved with dimple piercing, some professionals do not offer them at all. Others may offer them but often refuse them to anyone under the age of 18, even if that individual has the permission of a legal guardian. Dimple piercings cut through muscle and usually cause some mild form of nerve damage. This nerve damage can help hold the dimples in place even after the piercing closes up, but it can also be risky and could do unforeseen harm. The professional piercer should clean the outside of your cheek and should also instruct you to clean the inside of your mouth before making the dimple piercings. The needle and jewelry should also be sterilized. The piercer will puncture both cheeks symmetrically, right at the spot where natural dimples would fall. Afterward, he or she will place a straight barbell or other piece of piercing jewelry into each hole to prevent it from closing immediately. Your dimple piercings will need to be cleaned multiple times a day with a saline solution to prevent infection from setting in. You can keep the dimple jewelry in permanently if desired, but you can usually take them out after three months have passed. If the piercing did the expected nerve damage, you should have an indentation in your cheek even after the skin heals over the original hole. If you want something that looks more natural and will last for the rest of your life, learn about a plastic surgery procedure that will create dimple-like marks in your cheeks. Cosmetic surgery can be costly and does come with its own set of risks, but this option will give you fake dimples that look more natural than many other methods can.  A plastic surgeon will use local anesthesia for the procedure. He or she will make a small incision on the inside of the mouth and into the inner surface of the cheek. Using specialized tools, the surgeon will make an indentation in the cheek muscles and mucosal tissues. Afterward, the dimple divot will be held in place with internal stitches, and external stitches will be used to close the wound in the inner mouth. For larger dimples, a plastic surgeon may perform a punch tissue excision. During this procedure, a portion of the cheek muscle is completely removed, creating a deeper and more obvious indentation. In either case, the procedure will take an hour or less. You should expect some pain, swelling, and bruising immediately after the procedure. The area is also weak to infection afterward, so you will need to carefully and thoroughly follow any instructions provided by the surgeon concerning proper wound care and cleansing. For the first few weeks, your dimple-like indentations will be present at all times. Once your cheek muscles partially heal, though, you should only notice the marks when smiling.","output":"Dimple piercings, while risky due to potential infection and nerve damage, can create a dimple-like appearance, but plastic surgery offers a more natural-looking and permanent alternative."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He was a founding member and leader of the blues-rock band Double Trouble. Commonly regarded as a driving force behind the revival of blues music in the 1980s, Vaughan's talent and influence on the genre remain undeniable.  Sadly, Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and career came to an abrupt and tragic end on August 27, 1990, when he was involved in a devastating helicopter crash. Vaughan, along with four other passengers, boarded a Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter after performing at a concert in East Troy, Wisconsin. The helicopter was heading to Chicago, but unfortunately, due to poor visibility and foggy conditions, the pilot failed to see the rising terrain ahead and the aircraft crashed into the side of a ski hill shortly after takeoff. All five people on board, including Vaughan, were killed instantly, provoking widespread shock and grief within the music community and among Vaughan's fans. At the time of his death, Stevie Ray Vaughan was just 35 years old and seemed to be stepping into what might have been the most creative and productive phase of his career. Prior to the accident, Vaughan had been experiencing a renaissance both professionally and personally. He had finally overcome his long-standing drug and alcohol addiction issues, and his recent works were being met with critical acclaim. Many anticipated that his music would continue to reach new heights, and the tragedy of his death left a gaping hole in the music industry. Following the accident, there has been a surge of interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's music, contributions, and legacy. Many artists have cited him as a significant influence on their work, and his status as a blues icon has only grown stronger over time. Vaughan has been honored with various awards and accolades, including being posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.

Especially expressions like 2-year spot rate etc. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. A. no B. yes","output":"A. No Firstly, let's break down the individual components of your questions. The spot rate refers to the current price in the marketplace to immediately purchase or sell a financial instrument such as currency, commodity, or a bond. It's essentially the price that you would pay (or receive) today, or \\"on the spot\\". The spot rate is determined by supply and demand for the financial instrument in question. In the context of bonds, the spot rate is also considered as the yield to maturity (YTM), which effectively serves as the ‘internal rate of return’. It's the percentage that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows (payments to bondholder) to its current market price. The term \\"2-year spot rate\\" refers to the yield on a bond that matures in two years if that bond is bought today and held for its entire duration. On the other hand, a future rate is a rate that is agreed upon today for a transaction that will occur at a future date. It's essentially a locked-in price. In the bond market, the future rate often refers to the forward rate, which is a projection for what the interest rate on a bond is expected to be in the future. Both spot and future (forward) rates are important for bond valuation. The relationship between spot rates and future rates is essential to the term structure of interest rates, which is essentially a graphical depiction of interest rates (YTM) on debt for a range of maturities. If the future interest rate is higher than the spot rate, we say that the term structure is upward-sloping, which is typically the case. Conversely, if the future rate is lower than the spot rate, we have a downward-sloping term structure, which is less common but can occur. Now, to answer your question regarding the similarity between the two inquiries. Question one is asking for a definition of 'spot rate'. Question two, however, is more extensive. It is asking for an explanation of how 'spot rate' and 'future rate' are used in relation to bonds, particularly when one hears expressions like '2-year spot rate'. Therefore, while the two questions are related, they are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer:","output":"James Glickenhaus and Eric Red are both individuals who have contributed to the automotive industry in different ways; however, only James Glickenhaus can be accurately described as an automotive entrepreneur, while Eric Red is primarily known for his work as a screenwriter and film director but has also dabbled in automotive design. James Glickenhaus is an American investment professional and automotive entrepreneur recognized for his involvement in the supercar industry. He started out as an investment manager and is the founder of Glickenhaus & Co., an investment firm based in New York. His passion for automobiles led him to establish Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus (SCG), a boutique manufacturer of high-performance sports cars and racing cars. SCG focuses on producing limited-run, road-legal supercars with a particular emphasis on the racing heritage of legendary sports car makers like Ferrari. Some of the brand's most famous and notable models include the SCG 003, SCG 004, and SCG 007. These unique creations have garnered critical acclaim and respect in the automotive world, making Glickenhaus a renowned figure in the industry. Eric Red, on the other hand, is an American screenwriter, film director, and author best known for his work in the horror and thriller genres. Some of his most famous projects include the films The Hitcher (1986) and Near Dark (1987), as well as his directorial work in films like Body Parts (1991) and 100 Feet (2008). While Red's main contributions to the world of art and entertainment are in cinema, his endeavors in the automotive industry have been limited to vehicles' conceptual design and artistic renderings. One of Red's most notable forays into automotive design came in the form of the \\"Vampyre\\" concept car. This project, which took inspiration from classic horror films and the 1960s Batmobile, was developed in collaboration with renowned car customizer George Barris. The Vampyre is a one-off design that showcases Red's creative abilities beyond screenplay and filmmaking, but it has not led to any significant entrepreneurial ventures in the automotive industry. In summary, while both James Glickenhaus and Eric Red have made contributions to the automotive world in their respective ways, it is Glickenhaus who is a true automotive entrepreneur. He has established a company focused on producing unique and high-performance vehicles and has made a name for himself in the industry. Eric Red, primarily known for his cinema work, has dabbled in automotive design but has not pursued it as a business or entrepreneurial venture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Anger rife in flood-hit Malawi Malawians are angry, at least many of those who have been uprooted from their homes by floods after days of heavy rains. They are angry that they did not receive the necessary help from their government or aid agencies when they needed it most. Some have been sleeping rough on top of hills after they fled the rising waters. Others are sleeping on the floors of school classrooms, without food, blankets or dry clothes. The level of anger was evident when we traveled on Friday with the Malawian airforce on a mission to evacuate a group trapped in an area on the outskirts of Nsanje – the most affected district in the country. The airforce and police who accompanied the mission were also hoping to persuade people to move to government shelters situated in the town of Bangula. When we reached Nsanje, we found women cooking in the open. It's also where they'd been sleeping as well. Children were playing in the mud. Inside a crumbling mud-hit, an elderly and clearly unwell woman tried to sleep. Men, tasked with looking after their loved ones were most hostile towards the rescue workers at first. \\"Where were you when our people were dying - when we needed your help\\" one man shouted. After a lot of back and forth, and careful negotiation, some agreed to be airlifted from the site and to the the camp in Bangula. But others stubbornly refused to leave. Those frustrated by the response to their plight are, perhaps, justified. Aid and emergency efforts were slow - and to many it remains so. To be fair a disaster of this magnitude was unexpected even though parts of Malawi are flood prone. Those who live in these zones have often found a way of dealing with the problem after decades of living with it. But these floods were different. The dramatic rains affected more areas than ever, including many areas which usually do not experience floods. Roads and bridges have been washed away, cutting off crucial supply routes. On Tuesday, President Peter Mutharika declared a state of emergency in fifteen districts and appealed for help from the international community. The death toll now stands at 176 with more than 200,000 people displaced. The government is trying to ensure that the displaced are fed as a priority. At this point, they are receiving mostly maize and beans, but there are children under five and elderly people who need special meals. It is clear that Malawi cannot deal with this disaster all on its own. This Southern African country is one of the poorest in the world and the government simply does not have enough money to even properly run its administration. As is it stands, international donors have withheld 40 percent of their budgetary support of the nation after a corruption scandal in 2013 - in which more than 30m was stolen from government coffers. The scandal almost brought Malawi to its knees and the effects are being felt to date. So this disaster will only add further strain to an already struggling state. Help is coming though – albeit slowly. The World Food Programme (WFP) plans to airlift more than 100 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits. This will be enough to meet immediate food needs of 77,000 people. But we have not even started talking about other basic supplies that are still not available: blankets, mosquito nets, mattresses, clothes, cooking utensils. Most people came to the shelters with nothing. And rescue workers are still trying to reach those who are trapped, but getting supplies to these people is a logistical nightmare. Authorities are using boats and two military helicopters to try and reach the ones most in need. There's also the very real threat of water-borne diseases like cholera both in the shelters and villages. Robert Kisyula, national director of NGO World Vision, told me that the camps are crowding fast and sanitation facilities are hardly enough. \\"We need to prepare better, get everyone on board. If the rains continue and we experience more flooding I'm afraid the situation will be catastrophic.\\" he said. For now, the flood waters are receding and people have started going back home, unsafe as it is, to rebuild. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Anger is rising among flood-hit Malawians who feel they have not received adequate help from their government or aid agencies, with many sleeping rough or in overcrowded shelters without sufficient food or supplies.

Unfortunately, during their layover at the Hoover International Airport in Chicago, a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all flights, and the siblings are sent to the anarchic UM (unaccompanied minors') room, where they meet Christmas-spirited smarty-pants Charlie Goldfinch, surly tomboy Donna Malone, arrogant rich girl Grace Conrad, and mysterious Beef Wellington. Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter â whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights â intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in Santa Claus if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape. With Spencer's plan, the minors give Zach Van Bourke, the friendly clerk watching them, the slip, but Mr. Porter grows desperate to get the kids back, and sends all the airport guards to find them. After Donna and Grace get into a fight, Spencer decides that they're going to have to put their differences aside and work together as a team, and Beef leaves to go and get a Christmas tree. Along the way, he reflects on how his step-father, Ernie, hoped to make him stronger by saying men are made, not born. Meanwhile, Spencer and Katherine's father tries to drive to the airport in his biodiesel fueled car, but it eventually breaks down at a gas station. Fortunately, the owner lets him borrow a Hummer.

Sometime in the early medieval period, the Jews of central and eastern Europe came to be called by this term. In conformity with the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated Sefarad (Obadiah 20), France was called Tsarefat (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the Land of Canaan. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe German speech, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France.

The township of Crompton was originally within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when, owing to the English Reformation, this diocese was divided and Crompton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created.The exact date of the establishment of a place of worship in Crompton is uncertain. Although Shaw Chapel is certain to have been in existence since the early 16th century, it has been put that \\"Shaw Chapel is even more ancient than Oldham Old Church\\", as evidenced by the ancient toponymy of the area. Shaw Chapel was anciently known as St Patrick's Chapel-on-the-Moor, and during the reign of James I of England, \\"it was situate in the midst of the common called Shaw Moor, not a single habitation being near it\\". It is thought to have been constructed following an increase in wealth produced by the localisation of the woollen trade during a very bleak period, although, in 1552 it was noted that it had no endowment, and its ornaments were in poor condition. It was rebuilt in 1739 and enlarged in 1798, and rebuilt again in 1870. It is now known as the Church of Holy Trinity.Shaw and Crompton has three Church of England ecclesiastic parishes: Shaw, High Crompton, and East Crompton. In addition to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations, particularly Nonconformism and Methodism, have been practiced in Shaw and Crompton. Presbyterian ministers were recorded preaching at Shaw Chapel in as early as the 1650s. The Religious Society of Friends held conventicles in Whitfield in 1660s and 1670s.The following is a table of churches presently in Shaw and Crompton, as of 2018. Most of the above churches participate in Shaw's annual Whit Walks event, when congregations, choirs, and brass bands parade through the streets from their respective churches before taking part in one large, communal, inter-church service.

Given the question: Information:  - A hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games.  - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models  - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\"  - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created. While stamp collectors are of all ages, it has been particularly popular hobby among children, many of whom continued the hobby as adults.

Here is a news article: President Barack Obama and House Republicans clashed in a meeting Thursday afternoon over how soon the government can be reopened, even as the GOP offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks, according to sources familiar with the session.      House Republicans told Obama at the White House that they could reopen the federal government by early next week if the president and Senate Democrats agree to their debt-ceiling proposal. After the debt ceiling is lifted, a House GOP aide said they would seek some additional concessions in a government funding bill.      Text Size -      +      reset Boehner offers temporary debt hike Lew warns about debt ceiling      Obama repeatedly pressed House Republicans to open the government, asking them “what’s it going to take to” end the shutdown, those sources said. He questioned why the government should remain closed if both sides agreed to engage in good-faith negotiations on the budget, according to a Democratic source briefed on the meeting.      (WATCH: 10 great quotes on debt ceiling fight)      The meeting was described by both sides as cordial but inconclusive. Obama acknowledged to Republicans that notable progress had been made. Sources described the meeting without attribution, because the meeting was private.      Aides will continue the discussion through the night to see if they could find common ground on how to move forward on the debt limit and government funding. The short-term debt hike — which was originally proposed at the closed GOP meeting Thursday — did not include plans to reopen the government.      Obama agreed to review the House Republican proposal for reopening the government, but reiterated that he wouldn’t pay a ransom, the Democratic source said.      At the meeting, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) described the Republicans’ process as being two steps: passing the debt ceiling bill, and then opening a broad budget conference before the government can be reopened.      (PHOTOS: 18 times the government has shut down)      Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that this was a “good-faith” effort by Republicans. Ryan said both sides should “put their guns back in their holsters” — a bid to reach an agreement to avoid default, reopen the government and start broader budget talks.      Biden was mostly quiet in the meeting but did say at one point that Obama has made concessions as president that he hasn’t seen in 36 years in the Senate.      Publicly, House Republicans were mum when they returned to the Capitol.      “We had a very useful meeting,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said, upon returning from the White House Thursday evening. “It was clarifying I think for both sides as to where we are and the takeaway from the meeting was, our teams are going to be talking further tonight, we’ll have more discussion, we’ll come back to have more discussion. The president said that he would go and consult with the administration folks and hopefully we can see a way forward after that.”      (PHOTOS: Debt ceiling fight: 20 great quotes)      A senior House GOP aide said Obama “did not say yes or no to House Republicans’ offer.” Both sides are continuing talks tonight, according to the aide.      The White House said Obama had a “good meeting” with House Republican leaders that lasted about 90 minutes.      “After a discussion about potential paths forward, no specific determination was made,” according to a White House readout. “The President looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle.”      For much of Thursday, it appeared that Washington slowly edged away from a potential default on Thursday as congressional leaders crafted plans to raise the debt ceiling ahead of the Oct. 17 deadline. Wall Street liked the apparent legislative movement: The Dow Industrial Average soared 323 points Thursday.      (POLITICO's full government shutdown coverage)      Obama met separately with Senate Democrats and House Republicans at the White House. Senate Republicans will meet with Obama on Friday morning.      The talk in the House GOP visit centered around Speaker John Boehner’s proposed measure to lift the debt ceiling through Nov. 22, while banning Treasury from employing so-called extraordinary measures to keep paying the nation’s bills. The legislation had no corresponding spending cuts, as other debt ceiling bills had.      The legislation would also set up a negotiation over the borrowing cap and government funding. At this time, there are no spending cuts attached to the legislation. There is also no vote scheduled.      If Obama buys into the GOP plan, senior Republican sources say that Boehner could have enough internal political capital to move a bill next week to reopen government until Nov. 22.      Across the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is taking the temperature of his own GOP colleagues on ways to reopen the government — which has been shuttered for 10 days — and raise the debt ceiling.      Among the options under consideration is a proposal building on the work of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would raise the limit for two months and reopen the government for six months in return for a repeal of Obamacare’s medical device tax, a requirement to means test those seeking Obamacare subsidies and provide more flexibility for agencies to maneuver around the sequester.      Though ideas to move on from the budget mess are growing, there’s no consensus yet. A White House official sounded cool to the House GOP plan and offered support for a Senate Democratic proposal to raise the debt ceiling through the end of 2014, reiterating that the government should reopen and the debt ceiling be raised ahead of any talks.

The S&P 500 advanced 2.2% to 1,692.56, the benchmark's biggest jump since January 2.

Obama was accompanied by Vice President Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. The White House statement said the administration officials “listened to the Republicans present their proposal,” adding that Obama’s goal remains to both raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government.      House Republican leaders initially offered a six-week increase in the federal debt ceiling in exchange for negotiations with President Obama on longer-term “pressing problems,” but they stopped short of agreeing to end a government shutdown now in its 10th day.      Later in the day, Senate Republicans put forward a plan that would reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months.      Returning to the Capitol after meeting with Obama at the White House, members of a 20-strong House Republican delegation described the session as a good first step.      The White House denied a news report that Obama had rejected the House GOP’s proposal outright, saying that “no specific determination was made” after Obama, Vice President Biden and top officials listened to the presentation.      House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the gathering was “a very useful meeting” and indicated that conversations would continue into the evening.      “It was clarifying, I think, for both sides as to where we are,” he said.      “We put an offer on the table,” Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters. Obama “didn’t say yes; he didn’t say no,” Ryan said. “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.”      Earlier, in a news briefing following a closed-door meeting of House Republicans to present a plan to raise the debt limit temporarily, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said, “What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling.” He described the offer as a “good-faith effort on our part to move halfway to what he’s demanded in order to have these conversations begin.”      Obama is “happy” that House Republicans agree a federal debt default is not an option, but he would prefer a longer extension of the debt limit, White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the plan was disclosed.      Boehner did not immediately tell reporters specifics of the plan. But the speaker made clear that House Republicans were not agreeing to Obama’s demand that they pass legislation to fund the government without partisan riders, thereby ending the first government shutdown in 17 years.      [See the latest updates on the shutdown.]      In any case, Boehner’s proposal fell flat in the Senate, where members of both parties were clamoring to end the shutdown.      Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), speaking to reporters after a White House meeting between Obama and Senate Democrats, said the shutdown must end and the debt ceiling must be raised ahead of negotiations with the Republicans, who he complained keep changing their demands.      “This is a situation where they do not know what they want,” Reid said. His message to the GOP: “Open the government. Pay our bills. We’ll negotiate with you about anything.” Reid also said that Senate Democrats would “look at anything [House Republicans] send us,” but when asked about negotiating with them before reopening the government, he replied: “Not going to happen.”      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, was consulting fellow Republican senators to develop a proposal, advanced by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), to end the shutdown and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months.      The package sparked the first bipartisan negotiations since the standoff began in early September. But Collins’s proposal called for Democratic concessions including repeal of a tax on medical devices needed to fund Obama’s health-care initiative, and it would maintain deep budget cuts known sequestration through at least March.      The House GOP plan would suspend the debt limit until Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, while also forbidding Treasury Secretary Jack Lew from using “extraordinary measures” that his department has used in recent years to extend his borrowing authority for weeks after the ceiling is reached, according to a senior GOP aide who was in the room. This creates a hard “X date,” as financial analysts call the issue, leaving no wiggle room beyond that day.      The House Republicans essentially are offering a “clean” debt-limit increase in exchange for negotiations over reopening the government, aides said. The government shutdown would not end until Obama agreed to “structural reforms” to the tax code and federal health programs.      The Republican plan for a six-week increase in the debt limit, without conservative strings attached, was aimed chiefly at calming jittery financial markets, according to senior GOP advisers.      Financial markets soared earlier Thursday on the first sign of optimistic news out of Washington in almost a month, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 169 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. The rally continued when Boehner confirmed the plan at an 11 a.m. press briefing, and by 1:30 p.m. the Dow was up more than 225 points.      The plan was presented to the House GOP caucus Thursday morning after Lew warned lawmakers that he would be unable to guarantee payments to any group — whether Social Security recipients or U.S. bondholders — unless Congress raises the federal debt ceiling.      If the GOP plan goes over well with rank-and-file Republicans, Boehner could put the legislation on the floor for a vote late Thursday, aides said.      House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) described the plan at the news briefing as “a temporary extension of the debt ceiling in exchange for a real commitment by the president and the Senate majority leader to sit down and talk about the pressing problems” facing the country. Rep. Kevin McCarty (R-Calif.), the House majority whip, characterized these problems as “drivers” of increasing federal debt.      Obama has indicated he could support a short-term debt-limit hike, but he has also demanded that Republicans allow the government to reopen before he would negotiate with the GOP.      If the Republicans want to negotiate, they should “reopen the government, extend the debt ceiling,” Obama said last week. “If they can’t do it for a long time, do it for the period of time in which these negotiations are taking place.”      Carney, the White House spokesman, told reporters Thursday afternoon: “The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.” However, Obama “believes it would be far better . . . to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time,” as Senate Democrats are proposing.      “It would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and . . . mothballed the nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration,” Carney said. “But it is certainly at least an encouraging sign that . . . they are not listening to the debt-limit and default deniers.” If Republicans now recognize that default cannot be permitted, he added, “why keep the nuclear weapon in your back pocket?”      [Members of Congress are collecting pay during the shutdown.]      The first reactions from Republican House members appeared generally positive. But several insisted they would back the measure only with a commitment from the president to open negotiations over the next debt-ceiling hike.      “All we’re doing is saying, if the president hasn’t come towards us, we’ll just move the deadline out and offer it again,” said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). “We haven’t changed our position. We’ve just changed the timeline.”      Fleming rejected the idea that the proposal represents a concession from Republicans. “Not really, if we get a concession from the president, to sit down and negotiate. If he doesn’t agree to that, I won’t agree to the debt ceiling.”      Meanwhile, several of the House’s most conservative members withheld comment about the proposal. “I’m not very enthusiastic,” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said without elaborating.      Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, was noncommittal when asked about the plan and said his support depends on what happens in the meeting with the president Thursday.      “Some of this involves a conversation with the president,” Scalise said. “There’s nothing unilateral that can be done. It’s going to involve having the president finally put some things on the table of his own.”      Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group influential with tea party Republicans, said Thursday that while it remains committed to fighting Obama’s health-care law and opposes “clean debt ceiling increases,” it wants to give House GOP leaders “the flexibility they need to refocus the debate on Obamacare.” Therefore, the group said, it will not include votes in favor of the proposal in its rankings of lawmakers’ conservatism.      The plan would meet Obama’s demand for an increase in Treasury’s borrowing authority without any legislative attachments. But it would set the stage for tough negotiations, possibly lasting until Thanksgiving, over bigger fiscal matters, since the tentative plan calls for only a six-week increase of the debt limit.      Advisers cautioned that Boehner’s often unruly caucus, which has repeatedly rejected leadership initiatives in the past, needs to sign off on the plan before it can advance.      Reacting to the GOP proposal, a White House official said: “It is better for economic certainty for Congress to take the threat of default off the table for as long as possible, which is why we support the Senate Democrats’ efforts to raise the debt limit for a year with no extraneous political strings attached.”      Obama also wants House Republicans to allow a vote on the “clean” government funding bill that has been passed by the Senate, the official said. “Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the president will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement,” the official added. “While we are willing to look at any proposal Congress puts forward to end these manufactured crises, we will not allow a faction of the Republicans in the House to hold the economy hostage to its extraneous and extreme political demands. Congress needs to pass a clean debt-limit increase and a funding bill to reopen the government.”      Financial experts much prefer a longer-term extension of the debt ceiling, but even a brief extension would ease some of the turmoil that has been brewing on Wall Street. By the time markets closed Monday afternoon, the Dow had dropped 900 points in 14 trading days, losing almost 6 percent of its value.      Just three weeks ago, Boehner’s leadership team presented a plan to lift the debt ceiling accompanied by a one-year delay of Obama’s health-care law and a litany of other conservative domestic policy demands.      With Washington in gridlock and a key deadline in the debt-limit debate just one week away, Lew told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday morning that he would do all he can to minimize the pain of breaching the 16.7 trillion debt limit. But Lew also told the senators that in an unprecedented situation in which he would be relying entirely on the erratic flow of incoming revenue, the economy would suffer and there would not even be certainty that the government could make all interest and principal payments.      “No credible economist or business leader thinks that defaulting is good for job creation or economic growth,” Lew said. “If Congress fails to meet its responsibility, it could be deeply damaging to the financial markets, the ongoing economic recovery, and the jobs and savings of millions of Americans.”      Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a key conservative with ties to leadership and more junior tea party-backed colleagues, said Thursday morning that he and his colleagues “potentially” could support the new GOP debt-ceiling plan.      “We think there needs to be some movement in dealing with the overall problem,” he said. “It’d be nice to get some dollar-to-dollar cuts there.”      Asked whether he could support a short-term increase without related cuts, Jordan said he expected that question would be the primary topic of conversation among House Republicans on Thursday.      Amid growing anxiety about a debt default, Republicans in the House and the Senate floated ideas Wednesday for raising the debt limit — if only for a short time — in hopes of forcing Obama to the negotiating table.      One of the most significant ideas was brewing in the House, Ryan briefed conservatives on a plan to raise the debt limit for six weeks, which would give party leaders time to negotiate a broad agreement to overhaul the tax code and trim federal health-care and retirement spending.      The plan, which Ryan sketched in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Wednesday, was short on details. And it called for spending cuts of roughly 200 billion to cover the cost of raising the debt limit even in the near term — although senior GOP advisers said late Wednesday that they were also considering an increase with no strings attached.      Lew’s appearance is the first public confrontation between a senior administration official and Republicans since the fiscal showdown began last month. The meeting comes as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are questioning whether the administration has been too alarmist about the threat of going past an Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. Republicans have cited reports by credit-rating firms saying that the United States would not technically default unless it fails to make interest payments on its debt — which they regard as unlikely.      Echoing points made by Republican presidents and officials in prior administrations, Lew is tried to counter that argument by highlighting the broad risks of leaving the government with no borrowing authority.      “Certain members of the House and Senate believe that it is possible to protect our economy by simply paying only the interest on our debts, while stopping or delaying payments on a number of our other legal commitments,” Lew said. “The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens. There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets.”      For example, officials say, Lew pointed out that the Treasury routinely refinances about 100 billion in debt every week, paying back principal and taking on new debt. He noted that should investors back away from Treasury debt, it could make refinancing difficult and throw the country’s financial markets into even greater chaos.      Lew said the administration will face a series of difficult decisions even if Treasury can avoid what the credit-rating firms consider a default. In a scenario where federal spending will far exceed revenue, he said, the administration would have only imperfect options in deciding whom to pay. Officials say Lew will try to push Republicans to decide whom they wouldn’t pay — Social Security recipients or veterans.      “We are relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds . . .,” Lew said. “If U.S. bondholders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll-over their Treasury investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance.”      A Treasury official said Wednesday night that Obama would have to make the final decision in such a scenario.      Lew confronted a Senate Finance Committee stocked with Republicans who have been skeptical about the administration’s claims that breaching the debt limit would be catastrophic.      Among the committee’s members is Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has championed the notion that the Treasury Department could avoid chaos in financial markets by continuing to make interest payments to investors.      The senior Republican on the panel, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), has also expressed doubts about the risk of a debt-ceiling breach. But on Wednesday, Hatch acknowledged that blowing the Oct. 17 deadline would “scare the hell out of people.” And while Treasury might be able to pay interest on the debt, Hatch said, “the real question is whether it’s going to tank the stock market.”      Obama, when he meets Thursday with House GOP leaders, is planning to emphasize his refusal to “pay ransom” to avoid default and reopen the government. Ryan, nonetheless, held out hope that the “meeting at the White House will allow us to work together and find common ground.”      Thursday’s meeting is the second in a series the White House announced Wednesday aimed at breaking the impasse, reopening the government and raising the 16.7 trillion debt limit. Obama met first with House Democrats late Wednesday and plans to meet with each party in the Senate in the coming days, starting with a meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus Thursday.      Obama invited the entire 233-member GOP House conference to join him at the White House, but Republicans decided to send only an 18-member group comprising top leaders and key committee chairmen, including Ryan, Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (Ky.) and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.).      “Nine days into a government shutdown and a week away from breaching the debt ceiling, a meeting is only worthwhile if it is focused on finding a solution,” Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, said in a statement. “That’s why the House Republican Conference will instead be represented by a smaller group of negotiators.”      The White House said Obama is “disappointed” by Boehner’s decision to limit Republican attendance and emphasized that Obama will not be negotiating.      “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement.      Obama “will talk to anyone anytime . . . but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job,” Carney said. “If the Republicans want to have a real discussion, they should open the government and take the threat of default off the table.”      Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, circulated a memo from one of the nation’s leading credit-rating agencies that seemed to play down the threat of default. In the memo, Moody’s Investors Service said the Treasury Department is likely to continue paying interest on the government’s debt even if Congress refuses to lift the limit on borrowing, preserving the nation’s sterling AAA credit rating.      “We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,” said the Oct. 7 memo. “The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury’s extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.”      The memo offered a starkly different view of the consequences of breaching the debt limit than is held by the White House, many policymakers and other financial analysts. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs said the economy would take a devastating hit even if Treasury kept making payments on the debt, because the pullback in federal spending would amount to roughly 175 billion, or 4.2 percentage points of gross domestic product.      Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of PIMCO, the world’s largest bond company, agreed that the administration could take steps to contain the worst damage. But, he said, there would still be severe consequences.      “It would avoid a series of major and cascading disruptions to the functioning of a financial market that is at the heart of the core of the global financial system,” he said. “Having said that, equities and other risk assets would still likely sell off hard.”      Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) noted that Moody’s analysis is geared toward the well-being of its own investors, not average Americans. “When they say their clients will be okay, they’re not talking about people on Society Security, Medicare or our troops in the field. Moody’s doesn’t give a damn about any of those people.”      William Branigin, Rosalind S. Helderman and Scott Wilson contributed to this report. ||||| Still, the House Republican offer represented a potentially significant breakthrough. Even if Democrats found fault with the Republicans’ immediate proposal — for example, it would prevent the Treasury secretary from engaging in accounting maneuvers to stave off potential default — it was seen as an opening gambit in the legislative dance toward some resolution before the government is expected to breach its debt limit on Thursday.      Even before the meeting, the White House and its Democratic allies in Congress were all but declaring victory at the evidence that Republicans — suffering the most in polls, and pressured by business allies and donors not to provoke a government default — were seeking a way out of the impasse.      After some fretful weeks, the Democrats believe, Mr. Obama was seeing some payoff for his big gamble this year. Burned by his experience with House Republicans in mid-2011, when brinkmanship over the debt limit hobbled the already weak economy, Mr. Obama began his second term vowing never again to negotiate over raising the ceiling or to give any concessions to Republicans for performing an act that is their constitutional responsibility.      “The good news is that Republicans have accepted the principle that they’re not going to attach conditions to the debt ceiling,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “The bad news is they’ve only extended the debt ceiling for six weeks.”      Photo      For House Republicans, the maneuvers represented a near-reversal of their original strategy in September of going to the mat over the debt limit but not shutting down the government. Now, under pressure from falling poll numbers and angry business supporters, they are seeking a compromise on the debt ceiling. Yet for now, they are still refusing to finance and reopen the government without some concessions.      Mr. Boehner and his colleagues left the White House without speaking to waiting reporters, and quickly gathered in his Capitol suite for further discussion. Their debt limit proposal could come to a vote as soon as Friday.      Before the White House meeting, administration and Congressional Democrats said they were skeptical that House Republican leaders could pass the proposal. A large faction of Tea Party conservatives campaigned on promises never to vote to increase the nation’s debt limit. And Congressional Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal that did not also fully finance a government now shuttered since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.

Senate Democrats had their own White House meeting with Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. three hours before the House Republicans arrived, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declined to embrace the Republicans’ debt limit proposal until he saw it. He told reporters that Democrats would not negotiate on further deficit reductions until House Republicans agreed to the measure passed by the Senate to finance and open the government through mid-November.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “Not going to happen,” Mr. Reid said. “Open the government,” he added. “There is so much pain and suffering out there. It is really tear-jerking, to say the least.”      Separately, members of the Senate’s Republican minority, who are to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday, worked on a proposal for full-year government funding — at levels reflecting the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, but giving agencies flexibility to shift money around. They are considering adding it to any short-term debt limit increase that the House might pass and send to the Senate.      Mr. Ryan said before the White House meeting that Republicans were now willing to formally negotiate with Senate Democrats over a long-term, comprehensive budget framework. The Republicans have resisted such a move since April, fearing that it would require compromises, like raising additional tax revenues, that would enrage the party’s conservative base heading into the 2014 midterm elections.      Many House Republicans, leaving a closed-door party caucus earlier Thursday that at times grew contentious, said they would support their leadership’s short-term debt limit proposal. But they said they would do so only if Mr. Obama agreed to negotiate a broader deficit reduction deal, with big savings from entitlement programs.      The president has insisted he will not agree to significant reductions in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending — even his own tentative proposals — unless Republicans agree to raise revenues by curbing tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals. And Mr. Boehner in recent days reaffirmed the party’s anti-tax stance, which suggests that future talks could founder.      Economists across a broad spectrum agree that breaching the debt limit would damage the economy. The new Republican proposal could temporarily remove that threat. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"House Republicans clashed with President Barack Obama over reopening the government while offering a temporary increase to the debt limit. In a meeting with President Obama, the GOP proposed reopening the federal government by early next week if the president and Senate Democrats agree to their debt-ceiling proposal. Obama pressed House Republicans to open the government and questioned why the government should remain closed if both sides engaged in good-faith negotiations on the budget. The meeting was described as cordial but inconclusive. Aides will continue the discussion to find common ground on the debt limit and government funding."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What percentage of the Rogue River is Wild and Scenic? is inside the article: The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon., can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. When glider pilots look at the sky and see lenticular clouds, they know the flying will be good. The stationary, lens-shaped clouds - often mistaken for UFOs - tend to provide very smooth and strong lift, enabling gliders to fly vast distances. Skilled pilots can surf these \\"waves\\" in the sky for hours - until the lift or the light runs out. On Wednesday, strong north-westerly winds set up a series of giant \\"ripples\\" across the skies of Scotland and two pilots managed to break through the 1,000km (621 miles) barrier. John Williams, who lives near Scotlandwell in Perth and Kinross, said it was an \\"exceptionally good wave day\\" - the sort of day that only comes along every few years. He took off from the Scottish Gliding Centre's Portmoak airfield in his Antares glider at 06:50 and remained in the air for 11 hours and 38 minutes. He flew 1,684km - \\"which nicely puts it just over a thousand miles\\" - harnessing the power of the atmosphere alone. \\"When you get a wind from the north-west blowing across the mountains of Scotland, you get big ripples in the air set up. That's when you see these long, white lenticular clouds,\\" he told the BBC. \\"You can fly right along the edge of these clouds, just like a surfer on a beach. It's great fun.\\" The 63-year-old flew up to Killin, by Loch Tay, and then on to Aberdeenshire. He repeated the Killin to Aberdeenshire leg three times before flipping around and returning to his home airfield. \\"My first leg was a bit slower than I was hoping for, so I thought, I could do better than that, so I tried it again,\\" he said. \\"And then I tried it again which is a bit unusual.\\" His average speed on the middle run, which was the fastest, was 184km/h (114mph). To an untrained eye, it might appear that glider pilots are randomly floating around, but they're actually engaged in a constant search for lift and the best line to take them further and faster. It's something that becomes even more critical at the speeds Mr Williams was travelling. The pilot said he finds it an \\"endlessly fascinating\\" mental challenge, and one which enables him to concentrate hard for long periods of time. Mr Williams already holds the UK gliding distance record - 1,108km (688 miles) - which he set almost exactly 10 years ago. He said Wednesday's feat will not count as an official UK record, as the rules state you cannot repeat legs during the flight. But his achievement has still been noted as a \\"significant achievement\\" by members of the UK gliding community. \\"John is an exceptional pilot,\\" says Sant Cervantes, who holds four UK gliding records. \\"He's set the bar for people like myself to follow.\\" Mr Cervantes, 66, set off from Portmoak in a much smaller glider on Wednesday. He spent less time in the air, but still managed to fly 1,009km (627 miles) and reached an altitude of 13,000ft (3,962m). He followed a similar route to Mr Williams, who said it was the first time anyone had achieved such a distance in a glider that size. Mr Cervantes, a retired airline pilot, said there were only a handful of days each year which delivered really good wave days. But Scotland has more days like this than many countries and is generally recognised as having some of the best gliding conditions in Europe - which is why many committed gliders end up moving here. Mr Cervantes came to Scotland in 1972 and Mr Williams in 1997. Both of them now live conveniently close to the Portmoak airfield and devote much of their time to the world of gliding. \\"Your glider is extension of your personality,\\" Mr Cervantes told the BBC. \\"What you've got out there is an ocean of air and each day is different. It's a voyage of discovery - of the sky and yourself.\\" Each flight might be different, but days like Wednesday can live in a pilot's memory for a long time, the 66-year-old said. \\"If you're competent then you get in the zone like an athlete. You've got the conditions, you've got the glider and you've got yourself. \\"When you get it right you feel like you're in harmony with the environment. You're on a knife edge and you just shoot along. It's fantastic.\\" Summary:","output":"Two pilots in Scotland successfully glided over 1,000 km each by utilizing strong north-westerly winds and lenticular clouds, showcasing the country's exceptional gliding conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Overall, I have had a positive experience with this app, and I would like to give it a well-deserved 4-star rating. First and foremost, I appreciate the dedication of the developers to continually update and improve the app. The app offers a wide range of useful features to make smartphones more accessible for visually impaired users, such as the option for audio description and navigation assistance. The built-in text-to-speech engine is of high quality, making it easy to understand announcements and read-outs. In addition to the text-to-speech capabilities, this app also includes a feature called Explore by Touch. This allows users to glide their fingers over the screen and receive auditory feedback on the items they encounter, giving them a way to conveniently interact with their devices. Furthermore, I was amazed by the gesture-based navigation system. With just a swipe or tap of the finger, I could access different functions and features without any difficulty. The app also supports external switches, which opens the door for more users to take advantage of its functions. However, there were some areas where I felt the app could be improved. For instance, although the app claims to work seamlessly with most popular Android apps, I encountered some occasions where the talkback failed to function properly. This required me to restart the app to make it work again. While it is not a major issue, it did cause a bit of inconvenience. I also noticed that while using this app, my device's battery seemed to drain faster than usual. I understand this might be due to the additional processing required to support the accessibility features, but hopefully, future updates could optimize the app's efficiency to mitigate this issue. Lastly, while the app's gesture-based navigation does usually work well, there were some instances where the app failed to recognize my gestures accurately. Fine-tuning the gesture recognition might be beneficial in future updates. In conclusion, the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app is a valuable accessibility tool that helps make Android devices more user-friendly for those with visual impairments. With its extensive features and mostly seamless integration, it earns a solid 4-star rating. While there are some minor issues that can be addressed in future updates, I do recommend this app for anyone in need of its accessibility functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Condensed milk is cow's milk from which water has been removed. It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. Condensed milk is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries.  - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words  (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and  (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\"  - The Brigadeiro ( Portuguese for Brigadier ; also known in some southern Brazilian states as negrinho , literally \`\` blackie '' ) is a common Brazilian delicacy , created in 1940 . It is common throughout the entire country , as well as in Portugal , and is present in practically all the major Brazilian celebrations . Other types of Brazilian delicacies are Cajuzinho and Beijinho . The Brigadeiro is made from condensed milk , powdered chocolate , butter and chocolate sprinkles to cover the outside layer . It can be cooked in the oven or the microwave , in the form of individual little balls . It can also be eaten straight from the pot once it is done cooking . The information regarding when and where the Brigadeiro was invented is uncertain . As far as the creators of this treat , it is also uncertain of the nationality of the individuals .  - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.  - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" .  - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.  - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate.  - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru.  - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.

What are the names of the four other dogs who died in Soviet space missions?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens. Laika is also mentioned in the 2004 song \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" by Arcade Fire, included on their debut album Funeral.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.  Question: \\"As the struggle against the drug lords in Colombia continues, who was arrested with 1,000 pounds of dynamite?\\" Answer: \\"The fourth-ranking cartel leader\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect.

There are only a maximum of two senders (A and B) per conversation, and there are no conversations where SENDER A and SENDER B are both bots, or both humans; only one sender per conversation can be a bot, and only one can be a human. Knowing this, need only to classify whether SENDER A is 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about SENDER B. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself.

The conversation involves SENDER A and SENDER B, where only one of them is a bot, and the other is a human. Bots typically have a disjointed manner of speaking and make unrelated or incoherent statements, while humans will communicate more logically and coherently. Solution: Analyzing the conversation, SENDER A provides inconsistent and unrelated responses to SENDER B's questions and statements. For example, SENDER B asks about SENDER A's hand injury, but SENDER A keeps changing topics without addressing the question. Therefore, SENDER A can be classified as a 'Bot'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one.

Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates.

Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther.

Background: Ai Carina Uemura (Zhi Cun  Ai  karina, Uemura Ai Karina, born November 2, 1981), known mononymously as Ai (Japanese pronunciation: [ai], stylized as AI or A.I. ) is a Japanese-American singer and songwriter who was born in Los Angeles. Ai spent her childhood in both Kagoshima, Japan and Los Angeles. She debuted as a singer in 2000, later moving to Def Jam Japan and rising to fame with her album 2004 Ai. Context: Ai was born in Los Angeles in 1981. Her father was Japanese and her mother was half Italian-American and half Japanese. She moved to Kagoshima in Japan when she was 4, and went to elementary school and junior high school in Japan.  Ai was motivated to become a singer in her early teens, after singing at a cousin's wedding, having many people ask her if she wanted to be a professional singer, and hearing a gospel performance at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles in 1993. After graduating from junior high school in Japan, Ai returned to Los Angeles for high school, enrolling at Glendale High School, however found high school difficult due to never formally studying English. After making it through the audition process, she switched to the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, majoring in ballet. She became a member of the school's gospel choir. In 1998, she performed in a gospel choir at a Mary J. Blige concert at the Universal Amphitheatre, performing of \\"A Dream.\\" In the same year, she appeared as a dancer in the music video for Janet Jackson's song \\"Go Deep.\\"  In 1999, she joined an Asian girl group called SX4, who were produced by George Brown of Kool & the Gang. Ai was a member of the group for two years, and later in 1999 the group were offered a record label deal. While on her summer holiday in Kagoshima, she performed Monica's \\"For You I Will\\" on a local radio station, which led to her being scouted by BMG Japan. She decided to take the offer, and after leaving SX4 and graduating from high school in June 2000, moved to Tokyo and debuted as a musician later in 2000. Question: Where was Ai Born?

Options: - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice  Explain why a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"crushed ice\\" To make a cup of water colder, a human would choose crushed ice over the other options - liquid nitrogen, steam room, tidal waves, and ocean - for several reasons. These reasons include safety, accessibility, practicality, and effectiveness. 1. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool a cup of water is the safest option among those given. Liquid nitrogen, being an extremely cold substance, has the risk of causing frostbite or other injuries if not handled properly. Also, due to the Leidenfrost effect, adding liquid nitrogen to water may result in an explosion. A steam room would not lower the water temperature, but rather increase it, as it uses hot steam to warm up the room. Tidal waves and ocean would not be relevant options for cooling water and can pose potential danger or inconvenience to humans. 2. Accessibility: Crushed ice is widely available and easy to obtain. It can be found in ice trays at home, purchased from stores, or sourced from ice machines at social facilities. On the other hand, liquid nitrogen requires special handling, and acquiring it might not be feasible for daily use. A steam room, being a specific type of room designed for relaxation and an increased room temperature, eliminates this choice as an option. Furthermore, ocean and tidal waves are natural phenomena that don't directly apply to the context of cooling a cup of water. 3. Practicality: The process of cooling water using crushed ice is convenient and straightforward. Simply adding crushed ice into a cup of water will effectively lower its temperature as the ice melts and absorbs the heat from the water. Meanwhile, liquid nitrogen demands technical expertise, protective gear, and specialized equipment for safe handling. A steam room, again, is not suitable due to its function of raising a room's temperature instead of lowering it. Lastly, ocean and tidal waves are not practical options for cooling down a single cup of water. 4. Effectiveness: Crushed ice is effective in cooling water due to the process of heat transfer. When the ice interacts with water, it absorbs heat from the water, causing the ice to melt and the water temperature to decrease. This leads to a quick and efficient cooling of the water. Conversely, liquid nitrogen, although effective in cooling, poses a significant risk due to its extreme temperature and handling difficulties. A steam room would not provide any cooling effect on the water, while ocean and tidal waves don't offer a direct, effective method to cool a cup of water. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to cool down a cup of water as it is the safest, most accessible, practical, and effective option among those provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) To carry well, i.e. to hold the head high, with arching neck., does the word hold mean the same thing?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"hold\\" does not share the exact same meaning. However, both meanings do have a common foundation in the sense of maintaining control, stability, or position. Let's break down the differences and similarities in the meanings of \\"hold\\" in each sentence. 1. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"hold\\" refers to the ability to maintain control or stability in the face of a challenge or influence, in this case, alcohol. When someone says that a person can \\"hold their liquor,\\" it means that despite consuming alcohol, the person is still able to maintain a level of composure, mental clarity, and physical control. They may not get as visibly drunk or impaired as others might after consuming the same quantity of alcohol. 2. \\"To carry well, i.e., to hold the head high, with an arching neck.\\" In this instance, the word \\"hold\\" is used with a more physical connotation, referring to the manner in which one maintains their posture or position. When applied to holding the head high and having an arching neck, it conveys a sense of grace, confidence, and poise. Here, \\"hold\\" signifies the act of maintaining a specific physical stance, suggesting a conscious effort or exercise of control to achieve or maintain that stance. While there is a common theme of control and stability in both cases, the application and context are different. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" relates to how well someone can manage the effects of alcohol on their body and maintain the appropriate behavior. In the second sentence, \\"hold\\" pertains to the physical aspect of maintaining a certain posture or position with one's head and neck. In summary, although the word \\"hold\\" in both sentences retains a certain level of control, stability, or position, their meanings don't align exactly. The first sentence involves controlling the effects of an external influence (alcohol), while the second sentence pertains to the conscious effort of maintaining a specific physical posture or stance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The retired nurse wants both motorcyclists and drivers to be more aware of each other on the roads, to stop more crashes like this taking place. She said that the driver - who has since admitted causing death by careless driving - did not see the motorcyclist, but that Mr Holmes, who was driving nearly 40mph over the speed limit, also did not have time to take 'evasive action'. She said: 'I want to be involved in this campaign because I feel something positive can come out of his loss. 'If we can prevent one accident; one family going through what we have been through then David would not have died in vain. It is not easy to do but I hope somebody benefits from seeing it.' Mr Holmes was travelling back from King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he had been with colleagues. He overtook several cars on his powerful bike in the minutes leading up to the fatal crash. He was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. The car then drives into Mr Holmes's path, killing him instantly on impact. Mr Holmes was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. Speaking about the crash, his mother said: 'I know he rode fast that day. He loved speed and motorbikes. 'The driver did not see him and turned right across his path. David did not have time to take evasive action.' In the video, Mrs Holmes tells how her son, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey and had recently returned from The Antarctic, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. She said: 'We brought it back home in the back of his Dad's truck, He was jumping up and down with excitement. It was fabulous. A lovely, lovely memory. Mr Holmes, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. His mother Brenda, 62, has agreed for the footage to be released as part of a police road safety campaign. 'Although his father said he wishes he had never bought him that first bike, I would not have deprived David his 22 years of riding.' She said he was 'the most wonderful son' and was described by his friends as a 'gentleman and a legend'. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said he was 'confident' that the clip would save a life. In just three days, the video, recorded on the motocyclist's camera, has been watched by almost 4.5million people. He said: 'David's family have always been of the belief that if this video could save just one life then it would be worth it. 'Unfortunately, we'll never know if we have achieved this but I'm confident, with the level of interest that we will.' Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pictured, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. In April this year, Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. He was subsequently ordered to perform 130 hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also suspended for 18 months. The court heard Austin admitted he had not seen Mr Holmes before making the turn. In passing sentence, Judge Veits said no one had suggested Austin had been driving dangerously, but he had made a mistake that 'sadly' too many other drivers also make, of 'simply' not seeing the motorcycle. Headded: 'Nothing I can impose can turn the clock back and undo the tragic consequences of the accident that sadly took away the life of Mr Holmes. I only hope the family of Mr Holmes can now move on as this case is concluded and attempt to rebuild their lives.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article discusses the tragic incident in which 38-year-old motorcyclist David Holmes was killed instantly in a 97mph crash on the A47 road in Honingham, Norfolk. The accident occurred when a car turned into his path, and the entire incident was captured on David's helmet-mounted camera.

Gaius Julius Caesar (Latin: CAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR, , born: 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), usually called Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose.  In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \\"Populares\\" were opposed by the \\"Optimates\\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain.  These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh?  Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","output":"The first name of the person whose art bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh is Tom. The artist being discussed is Tom Thomson, who was a Canadian artist known for his brilliant oil sketches of natural scenes and an important influence on the Group of Seven."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My father was named James Page Jackson because he was born on the old Jackson plantation in Lancaster county, Virginia. He named one of his daughters Lancaster for a middle name in memory of his old home. Clarice Lancaster Jackson was her full name. A man named Galloway bought my father and brought him to Arkansas. Some called him by the name of Galloway, but my father always had all his children keep the name Jackson. There were fourteen of us, but only ten lived to grow up. He belonged to Mr. Galloway at the time of my birth, but even at that, I did not take the name Galloway as it would seem like I should. My father was a good carpenter; he was a fine cook, too; learned that back in Virginia. I'll tell you something interesting.

Mr Barnes managed to enter the device's software innards via connections found on its base. He said taking over the device was \\"trivial\\" once an attacker had access to an Echo. Amazon's Echo uses artificial intelligence (AI) to respond to voice commands from users to carry out many different functions, including answering queries, playing songs and ordering goods from a retailer. The hack started by peeling off the rubber base of the Echo to expose a grid of electrical contacts, wrote the researcher from MWR Info Security in a blog. Connecting to one of the contacts let Mr Barnes watch the Echo's boot-up procedure and work out how it was configured. Armed with this knowledge Mr Barnes wrote software that, once loaded on a small memory card and connected to one contact pad, gave him control over the device. Using this he examined how it handled audio and then created attack code which forwarded everything it heard to a remote server. That deep access meant he had complete control over the code the device ran and what it did with customer data, he said. Amazon did not comment directly on Mr Barnes' findings but said in a statement: \\"Customer trust is very important to us. \\"To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date.\\" The security researcher acknowledged that the requirement to get physical access to the device to carry out the attack was a \\"major limitation\\". However, he added, it was possible that Echo owners would take their devices with them on holidays or business trips - situations that could expose them to attack. Second-hand devices may also be compromised in some way. The attack was carried out on the versions of the Echo that were released in 2015 and 2016. More recent versions of the Echo are not susceptible to the same attack. Mr Barnes recommended that hardware makers start assessing novel gadgets on their ability to resist physical attacks \\"as early as possible\\". \\"Product recalls and modifications can be expensive in post-production, so physical security should be considered throughout the development life cycle,\\" he said.","output":"A man named Mark Barnes found a way to control some older versions of a device called the Echo. The Echo is a smart speaker made by Amazon that listens to your voice and does things like play music and answer questions. Mark took off a part of the Echo, connected some things to it, and was able to control it and listen to what people say. But, he needed to touch the Echo to do this, which means it's harder to do unless the person is close by.

It's a story about a big, scary shark that scares a lot of people. Well, this movie has changed how some grown-ups think about sharks. They saw the movie and thought that the only way to solve the problem of sharks is by getting rid of them. This research showed that Jaws has influenced leaders in a place called Western Australia (that's a state in a country called Australia). After the movie Jaws came out, some politicians or leaders in Western Australia started saying that it's okay to kill sharks because they are dangerous. Even though there are many kinds of sharks and not all of them are scary or harmful, people still got scared because of that movie. So, those politicians thought that they had to do something, and they did what they saw in the movie - they wanted to find and kill sharks. Many people today still think that the only solution to the shark situation is to catch and kill them, all because of that movie! But actually, sharks are important for our oceans. They help to keep the seas healthy and can balance the food chain. In conclusion, the movie Jaws made people think that killing sharks is the right thing to do, even when they aren't hurting anyone.

Blood containing waste products is circulated through the body: This step is essential because it explains how waste reaches the kidneys in the first place.

Waste enters the kidneys: The waste-carrying blood arrives at the kidneys, where the filtration process begins. 3. A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass: During this step, the waste and fluids are separated from the blood in the kidneys. 4. Prevents larger molecules to pass: The kidney's filtration system prevents larger molecules, like proteins and blood cells, from passing through, ensuring that only waste and excess fluid are filtered out. 5. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: The filtered fluid, which contains important nutrients and electrolytes, is reabsorbed into the bloodstream to maintain overall body health and balance. 6.

He was a Navy veteran and native of New York. (Several items in this photo gallery have been updated and corrected.)      Sept. 16, 2013 Aaron Alexis, 34, was the gunman. He was a Navy veteran and native of New York. (Several items in this photo gallery have been updated and corrected.) Fort Worth Police Department/via AP      Standing at an ATM in the first-floor atrium of the building where she works at the Washington Navy Yard, Patricia Ward was startled by a rapid succession of sharp noises that seemed to come from overhead.      Bam, bam, bam . . .      It was about 8:15 a.m. Monday in Building 197, a brick edifice that houses employees of the Naval Sea Systems Command.      “Was that a gunshot?” one of Ward’s companions wondered aloud.      They were on their way to have breakfast in the cafeteria nearby.      More loud cracks came almost instantly.      “We knew it then,” Ward said. “We just started running.”      So began a morning of tragedy and terror: a mass shooting that killed a dozen victims and injured eight others at the historic facility. Authorities said a 34-year-old Texas man apparently armed with high-powered guns opened fire, leaving a trail of bodies before he died, too, either from police bullets or his own hand.      His motive remains a mystery, and the precise sequence of events has yet to become clear. But for those who survived, who saw or heard what happened from narrow vantage points — crouched under a desk, standing flat against a wall, prostrate on the floor beneath a table — the memory is indelible.      A crisp September morning, Indian summer:      At 8 a.m., reveille crackled over loudspeakers at the Navy Yard as two sailors hoisted an American flag up a pole, marking the official start of the workweek. This being a military installation, many on the grounds, on the north bank of the Anacostia River, had already been busy for a while.      Tim Birkenbuel, a Navy contractor, was in his second-floor office when he heard what sounded “like a table falling on concrete.”      He heard the same sound again, and again — what turned out to be several gunshots in rapid succession. Some of his co-workers ran to the glass panels that surround the building’s atrium to see what was going on. Birkenbuel then barricaded them in the office for safety. And they waited.      Mark Vandroff, a retired Navy captain, had arrived by Metro from his home in Bethesda at 5:50 a.m. He had already worked out in the Navy Yard’s gym, showered and read through his e-mails. He was on the third floor, preparing for a meeting about the planned purchase of Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers.      A floor above him, Anthony Salemi, a logistics expert, was settling in at his desk. Down the hall, a dozen top civilian officials of the Navy’s Senior Executive Service were scheduled to soon meet for a briefing on billions of dollars’ worth of purchases.      Then came the sound. A conference table falling, Salemi thought.      “We’re always setting up for seminars and things like that,” he said. “I figured the leg had collapsed and one had fallen.”      But: “I heard someone yell, ‘Call 911!’ And I knew it was a shooting.”      He headed toward a staircase. Then, like Patricia Ward, Salemi heard a second series of sharp cracks — bang, bang, bang — and he broke into a sprint.      Vandroff had heard the initial noise, too, and like the others, he wondered what it was.      “The first sound that I heard, that I now think was gunfire . . . was a loud sound shortly after 8,” Vandroff recalled. “It sounded unusual, and we all looked at each other around the table, like, ‘What the heck was that?’ And then, the second sound — that was definitely gunfire. That was the unmistakable sound of gunfire. And it was very, very loud. . . .      “After that, people started screaming: ‘Close the doors! Close the doors!’ ”      Vandroff and eight others in the third-floor conference room stood up. Someone shut the door, but it didn’t have a lock. They decided to barricade themselves in. They flipped the conference table on its side. They wedged it under the door handle and packed chairs behind it. Then they got down on the floor.      Another burst of gunfire sounded, this one closer. Vandroff said he buried his head, then looked up when the sound stopped. There were two bullet holes near the top of a wall, as the gunfire continued.      “At different points, you couldn’t really tell where it was coming from,” he said. “The shot that when we looked up and saw the bullet holes in the wall was definitely close.”      Rick Mason, a program management analyst, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth-floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the shooter aimed at people in the first-floor cafeteria.      Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus said that as he was leaving the building, he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and he heard more shots from inside his workplace.      Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe and spoke briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. He spun toward the sound. When he turned back, the man he had been talking with was lying on the ground, shot in the head.      Uncertain where the shooter was, Jirus ran.      “I was just lucky,” he said. “The other person was shorter than me. There were two shots. He got that guy. He didn’t get me. . . . The randomness of it — standing right next to me, one person gets shot.”      David Stevens, a Navy contractor, was on the phone when he heard an initial volley of gunfire and people shouting that a shooter was on the fourth floor. He said he ran to the edge of the atrium and glanced up. Then he heard a “second deluge” of shots. The fire alarm sounded.      The first call to D.C. police came about 8:15 a.m., and Chief of Police Cathy L. Lanier said officers arrived at the Navy Yard “within literally two to three minutes.”      “Internal security had already . . . identified and engaged the suspect,” Lanier said — meaning they were trading shots with him. “We already had victims down at that point,” she said. “Within seven minutes, we had active-shooter teams inside the building, moving through the building.”      Quickly, District police were joined by U.S. Marshals, U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, who entered the building and, talking on one radio frequency, began moving floor to floor, helping victims and securing rooms.      A Park Police helicopter airlifted an injured D.C. police officer from atop the building, while a helicopter from another agency circled to search for possible other suspects. The FBI arrived a bit later.      At 8:28 a.m., an e-mail went out to Navy Yard workers: “ALL HANDS on WNY Shelter in place.” Twenty minutes later, another e-mail: “All Commands on WNY report accountability of your personnel.”      Then, at 9:15 a.m.: “Shelter in Place and or a Lockdown is security posture taken to protect personnel. Stay indoors, if outside, get within a building. Stay away from windows or open buildings, Remain indoors until the ‘all clear’ is given. Secure doors and windows.” And a half-hour after that: “ALL PERSONNEL ON WASHINGTON NAVY YARD CONTINUE SHELTER IN PLACE. REMAIN CLEAR OF ALL WINDOWS.”      Lanier said officers eventually encountered the gunman.      “There was a gunfight with the suspect,” she said. And the suspect “was eventually deceased.” ||||| Alex Wong/Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 16: Emergency vehicles and law enforcement personnel respond to a reported shooting at an entrance to the Washington Navy Yard September 16, 2013 in Washington, DC. According to the latest news report, several people were shot with the shooter still possibly active.      WASHINGTON — Two workers at the Washington Navy Yard who came face to face with a gunman in a dimly lit hallway recounted Monday how he silently raised his rifle and opened fire on them.      \\"We're lucky he was far enough away he was a bad shot,\\" said Terrie Durham, a civilian employee in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command.      Her co-worker, Todd Brundidge, said the shots didn't come with a warning.      Don Andres, a legislative aide to Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., describes to MSNBC's Chris Jansing the scene near the Washington Navy Yard, where 12 were wounded and at least four people died after a shooting at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command.      \\"No words. He raised the gun and started firing,\\" he said.      More than a dozen people were shot in the Monday morning rampage, including a man who was standing next to Navy Commander Tim Jirus.      Jirus said he had fled the building and was in a back alley when a worker from a maintenance facility approached, asked what was going on — and was shot right there.      \\"He just came up and was like, 'Hey I understand you have a shooter in your building,'\\" Jirus said.      \\"I said I heard some things earlier, I don't know if they were gun shots. And then I heard two more gunshots and it hit the guy next to me and not me.\\"      He said the man fell to the ground and he took off.      Speaking about the deadly shooting at a Washington D.C., area Navy Yard, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus says, \\"The Navy family has suffered an horrific attack.\\"      \\"We know people we work with were shot and they're on the way to the hospital and we don't know if they're going to make it or not make it,\\" Jirus said. \\"I consider myself very lucky.\\"      Jirus didn't see the shooter, but Durham and co-worker Brundidge had a terrifying closeup.      The pair were in their third-floor office when an alarm went off about 8:15 a.m., followed by an announcement of a fire emergency and orders to leave the building.      \\"I was on the phone and someone came up to my desk and said, 'This is not a drill. Someone had just been shot. There are shots in the building,'\\" Brundidge said.      \\"So I hung up the phone and started to try to get people out of the building.\\"      Durham said she wasn't exactly sure what was happening but knew it was a dire situation.      \\"Our wardens came running, yelling for everyone to get out of the building,\\" Durham said.      \\"We were standing right outside the door to go to the exit and we saw a man standing down the hall,\\" she said.      Dr. Janis Orlowski, the Chief medical officer at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, says, the three shooting victims in the deadly attack that left 13 people dead are \\"doing well.\\"      He was about 40 yards away but close enough for them to see he was clad in blue and had a weapon.      'He aimed at us and shot but missed'      \\"He was a tall man, appeared to have dark skin, looked like he was in some kind of uniform and he had a rifle,\\" Durham said.      \\"And he aimed at us and shot but missed, thank God.\\"      Before the shots, there was silence.      \\"He said nothing,\\" Brundidge said.      The stairwell was dimly lit so they didn't get a good look at the gunman's face, but Durham could see how close they came to being shot.      \\"He aimed high and missed,\\" she said. \\"I saw where the shot missed. It was a few feet ahead of us and a foot or above where we would have been standing.\\"      She said she ran for her life, yelling to everyone else on the stairwell, \\"There is a man shooting in the building, get out, get out!\\"      Brundidge and Durham are among thousands of people who work at the Washington Navy Yard, a sprawling facility that is home to several naval commands.      Ameisha Boatwright arrived for a job interview only to find police and fire trucks with sirens screaming.      \\"I told myself, I'm getting outta here,\\" she said. \\"I can do this interview another day. I'm just going home now — I'm scared.\\"      NBC News Doug Hughes, a project engineer at the Washington Navy Yard.      Hours after the gunfire ended, relatives of Navy Yard employees were still waiting for word on their loved ones.      Jacqueline Alston, who works for the National Parks Service, was hoping for a reunion with her husband, Earnest Johnson, who is an office cleaner in the building where the gunman stalked the halls.      'I'm numb'      \\"I'm numb,\\" she said. \\"I'm asking God, let me hear that voice, let me see that man.\\"      Doug Hughes, a project engineer at the Navy Yard who was at Nationals Park heading to a train home more than four hours after the shooting, said he was on lockdown during the rampage.      \\"When I was told what we heard was shots, I went to one of the offices and myself and one other lady locked ourselves in,\\" Hughes said. \\"I'm glad I'm out of it and I just want I go home.\\"      Asked what he’s going to say to his wife when he gets home, Edwards said, “I’m not going to say anything; I’m just going to hug her.”      Antoinette Proctor, a supervisor at the Navy Exchange, said her hours-long lockdown was spent well away from the shooting.      \\"It was very frustrating to be sitting there and not knowing what was going on, on the yard, what's actually happening around us. It was really frustrating,\\" she said, adding she was on her way home to her children. \\"Today was hell, I didn't wake up this morning to experience this.\\"      'This is not good'      Dr. Janis Orlwoski, chief medical officer at Washington Medical Center, said she spoke to the three wounded victims taken to her hospital, who were described as in stable condition.      \\"There is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to try to eradicate,\\" Orlwoski said. \\"I may see this every day, I may be the chief medical officer of a major medical center, but there's something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings. ...      \\"We have to work together to get rid of it. I would like all if yoy to put my trauma center out of business,\\" she said. \\"This is not America. This is not Washington, D.C..

Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael.

Movie title: Aladdin Movie plot: The story begins with a young boy named Aladdin, trying to make money by being a servant for a day, with no success. Meanwhile, a shifty man named Hassim, who has journeyed from Marrakesh, visits the local medicine woman, Fatima, who tells Hassim that in order to reach a certain treasure that he wants, he needs Aladdin. Hassim visits Aladdin and his mother, claiming that he's Aladdin's long lost uncle, and says that he can make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. The next day, Hassim and Aladdin travel outside the city to the location of the treasure. When they arrive, Hassim begins an incantation to open the cave; Aladdin finds out that Hassim isn't his uncle, and that he only brought Aladdin to this spot because he is the only one that can enter the corridors of a dark cave and claim the treasure inside: an old oil lamp. Aladdin reluctantly steps inside and walks past the traps within, leading him to a beautiful garden with friendly animals. He eventually finds the lamp; he pauses to pick flowers from a tree for his mother, which instantly turn into jewels, so he takes a whole sack full. Aladdin makes it back to Hassim, but fears that he may be killed after Hassim takes the lamp away from him, and so he refuses to give it to him. Enraged, Hassim uses his powers to close the entrance of the cave forever, trapping Aladdin. Aladdin kneels to pray and accidentally rubs the lamp, releasing a powerful genie inside, who can grant any wish. Aladdin wishes that he was out of the cave and back home. Aladdin tries showing his mother the magic lamp, but she fears it is too dangerous and wants him to put the lamp away and remain silent about it. Cut to four years later, Aladdin and his mother must hide indoors for the sultan and his daughter Layla are being escorted to the bathing house and the sultan orders that no one looks upon his daughter, or the punishment is death. Curious by the sultan's order, Aladdin sneaks out while his mother sleeps. He sneaks into the bathing house and sees Layla from inside, and is... A:","output":"Hassim closed the cave in an attempt to prevent Aladdin from escaping with the magical lamp. As the plot unfolds, we learn that Hassim, driven by his greed for the enormous treasure, had come from Marrakesh to acquire the powerful lamp through any means necessary. His intentions were to manipulate and deceive, in order to take the treasure for himself without facing any danger. He then went to Fatima, the local medicine woman, who revealed to Hassim that Aladdin would be the key to obtaining the lamp. Hassim approached Aladdin with lies, claiming to be his long-lost uncle and promising him and his mother a life of wealth beyond their wildest dreams. To execute his plan, Hassim brought Aladdin to the cave containing the treasure, knowing that Aladdin was the only one who could enter it and retrieve the lamp. Aladdin's role in this scheme was to brave the dangerous corridors and traps within the cave, ultimately delivering the lamp safely to Hassim. As events unfolded, Aladdin discovered Hassim's true intentions and rightfully decided not to hand over the lamp to him. Aladdin's courageous act of defiance enraged Hassim, who had gone to great lengths to deceive Aladdin and his mother to satisfy his greed for power and wealth. In a fit of anger and to ensure that he would not lose the treasure forever, Hassim used his powers to close the entrance of the cave, trapping Aladdin inside, hoping to either force him to comply or prevent anyone else from discovering the powerful secrets contained within. Fortunately for Aladdin, as he knelt to pray while trapped in the cave, he inadvertently discovered the power of the lamp he had found, releasing a powerful genie capable of granting any wish. Thanks to the genie, Aladdin was able to escape the cave and return home with the lamp, preventing Hassim from achieving his malevolent goals. In conclusion, Hassim closed the cave as a desperate measure to retain control over the valuable treasure and keep Aladdin confined, preventing him from exposing Hassim's true intentions and treacherous machinations. This crucial moment in the film's plot showcases the conflict between Aladdin, an innocent and resourceful young boy, and Hassim, a deceitful and greedy antagonist, setting the stage for the movie's ensuing dramas, challenges, and adventures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Choose an empathetic friend who is a good listener. Say you need to vent about the breakup. Have this friend listen as you reflect on the breakup.  Make sure you select a friend who is a good listener. A friend who tends to interrupt, or give advice, is not the best option. Self-reflection can help you understand the loss. As you go over the relationship with a friend, you may begin to see what went wrong. You can process the information out loud, which can allow you to see something you missed before. Let your friend know exactly what you need from them. Whether it's a shoulder to cry on, someone to bring you out for a good time, or a fellow person to be angry with, your friend should know what you want from them. For example, you could say, \\"Thanks for listening to me, Jen. I know I've talked a lot about this breakup with you, and I really appreciate that you're taking the time to listen. I need to talk this through again to help me understand what happened.\\" As with talking, writing is a great form of self reflection. Try writing down your thoughts in a journal. You can also write a letter to your ex you do not intend to send. Here, you can talk about your confusion and sadness over the breakup.  You can express anything you wanted to say to your ex but could not. Talk about what you loved about the relationship, but also what was frustrating. Do not censor yourself. Just let your thoughts unfold. You may gain some insight through writing. As you write about the relationship, you may have a realization about why it ended. You may, for example, start to see you and your ex were very different as you write things down. This can help you gain insight. During a period of self reflection, ask yourself hard questions about the relationship. The answers to these questions may help you understand why things ended.  Were you and your ex really right for one another? Think about whether you were compatible long term. Did you have different interests and goals? Were you personalities always compatible? Were the two of you really in love? Love does fade over time. It's possible the passion had drained from the relationship. Were there any differences you missed before? Some differences and disagreements are hard to reconcile. It's not always possible to understand why a relationship ended. Human beings are complicated. You may not get an understandable answer, even if you were able to speak to your ex.  Try to come to terms with the fact there will always be confusion surrounding a breakup. Even if your ex were to explain, there's a chance you would not understand or accept his explanation. Remember, you can heal from the breakup without closure. While it can be helpful to know why things ended, it is not necessary to move forward. Ask yourself if knowing why it ended will make it hurt any less.","output":"To cope with a breakup, engage in self-reflection by discussing the relationship with an empathetic friend, writing in a journal or unsent letter, asking yourself hard questions, and accepting that closure is not always necessary for healing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When recommending an app to a friend, it is crucial to consider their needs and preferences. In this case, the reviewer appears to have found significant educational value in the app, describing it as an \\"ocean of knowledge.\\" This implies that the app may have a vast database of information or a diverse range of subjects covered, making it suitable for individuals seeking to learn from a seemingly inexhaustible resource.  Furthermore, the reviewer's statement, \\"I like it,\\" highlights that they find the app enjoyable and engaging. When an app is both educational and enjoyable, it is more likely that users will remain engaged, continue to learn, and extract value from it. In this case, recommending the app to a friend who has a similar interest in expanding their knowledge and a curiosity for learning would be a suitable choice.

(CNN) -- The threatening calls reportedly came one after the other to Mexico's main Catholic seminary.  Callers, claiming to be from one of the country's feared drug cartels, offered an ominous warning: Pay up if you value the safety of your priests.  \\"They called several times. They identified themselves as the Familia Michoacana, but who knows?\\" Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico City, revealed at a Mass this week. \\"I spoke with the authorities. We made the appropriate report. Because they wanted us to pay. Because if not, they would kill one of us. They wanted to extort 60,000 pesos (4,600).\\"  Reports of extortion have become increasingly common as drug cartels expand their reach in Mexico. But public denouncements of such attempts are rare.  Rivera called on parishioners to report extortion to authorities, and he urged them not to pay.  His description Sunday of the extortion attempts and a statement denouncing drug violence give a glimpse into the problems faced by a Catholic Church often caught in the crossfire of warring cartels and government efforts to stop them.  In the country's capital alone, more than 10 priests have been threatened with extortion, said the Reverend Hugo Valdemar Romero, a spokesman for the archdiocese.  \\"None of them have paid,\\" he told CNN. \\"Last year, two extortionists were arrested.\\"  It's not uncommon for individual parishes to face extortion threats, he said.

The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones.

Answer based on context: The Russians and the Japanese both contributed troops to the eight-member international force sent in 1900 to quell the Boxer Rebellion and to relieve the international legations under siege in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to Manchuria, nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and were ejected from Manchuria. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria. The Russian troops settled in and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria.

We need to determine if, as a result of the Head event, PersonX will be perceived as the Tail event or not.  Simple steps to solve this task: 1. Understand the Head event - \\"PersonX asks PersonY's boyfriend\\". 2. Understand the Tail event - \\"If he loves her\\". 3. Assess if the action mentioned in the Head event leads to the perception of the Tail event. In this case, the Head event is PersonX asking PersonY's boyfriend about his love for PersonY. The Tail event does not describe any attribute or persona of PersonX. Therefore, we cannot conclude that PersonX will be seen as \\"If he loves her\\" based on the given event.

Woodworking typically involves processes such as cutting, shaping, or assembling wooden materials to create furniture, cabinetry, or other items. The question presented asks us to conclude whether \\"The man is fixing a plumbing issue.\\" Given the information provided, we are not able to make this determination. A plumbing issue would involve problems with water supply, drainage systems, or fixtures such as pipes, taps, or other plumbing apparatus. These tasks would likely be undertaken by a plumber or someone with expertise in fixing such problems, rather than a woodworking professional. Furthermore, the location of the man, a wood shop, does not suggest that he is currently dealing with a plumbing issue. A wood shop typically entails an environment dedicated to woodworking tasks, and it is unlikely that fixing a plumbing issue would be a priority in such a place. Considering the information available, the appropriate answer is: --no.

The plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together. It is not worth one tenth the cost of the item. Keep it in the store. MGA should re-evaluate this item. Is the review positive or negative?","output":"The review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the Runway Disco toy that their daughter received as a Santa gift. Their main concerns revolve around the quality of the product and its high cost, which lead them to believe it is not a worthy purchase. The reviewer starts by sharing their personal experience with the toy, highlighting the difficulties they had in assembling the product. They mention that they had to put the same piece together ten times, suggesting that the process was frustrating, time-consuming, and likely complicated. This is an indication of poor design or unclear instructions and contributes to the overall negative impression of the toy. One of the major complaints in the review is the perceived poor quality of the materials used in the toy. Specifically, the reviewer feels that the plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together as they should. This further adds to the dissatisfaction, as buyers expect a product to be well-made and durable, particularly when it comes at a high cost. In terms of the toy’s value, the reviewer argues that it is not worth one-tenth of its cost, indicating that they find the price to be exorbitant in comparison to the actual quality and enjoyment provided by the toy. This is a strong critique, as it suggests that the product may potentially feel like a waste of money for other buyers considering the purchase. The review concludes with a stern recommendation for potential buyers to keep the product in the store, essentially advising against purchasing it. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that the manufacturer MGA should re-evaluate the item, which affirms the dissatisfaction with the toy and promotes the idea that it should be improved. In conclusion, the review is decidedly negative, as it showcases dissatisfaction with various aspects of the Runway Disco toy – its assembly process, overall quality and durability, and its price.

During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive. Although Tarvaris Jackson later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 32-21, the Vikings were unable to score again, and the Redskins emerged with a victory. This enabled them to ensure that they will be able to control their own \\"destiny\\" to make the playoffs. Question: Which running back threw a touchdown pass in the second quarter?

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A?  John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B.  Hint: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. A:","output":"In case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A. Step 1: Understand the given information - Case A: Stable population of Siberian tigers (apex predator) in the sixteenth century - Case B: Decreased population of Siberian tigers in the seventeenth century due to the introduction of guns Step 2: Consider the hint provided and relate it to the cases - Apex predators have profound effects on ecosystems, including controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators - Removal of top-level predators can cause or disrupt trophic cascades and lead to mesopredator release Step 3: Apply the hint to the cases - In case A, the stable population of apex predators (Siberian tigers) would keep the number of mesopredators in check - In case B, the decreased population of apex predators (Siberian tigers) due to human intervention (guns) would lead to mesopredator release Step 4: Conclude  - In case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A due to the decreased population of Siberian tigers leading to mesopredator release."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},q={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
