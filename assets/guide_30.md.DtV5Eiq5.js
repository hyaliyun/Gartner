You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this article and answer this question Much of Afghanistans livestock was removed from the country by early waves of refugees who fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 2001, the livestock population in Afghanistan had declined by about 40% since 1998. In 2002, this figure was estimated to have declined further to 60%. An FAO survey done in the northern regions in spring 2002 showed that in four provinces (Balkh Province, Jowzjan Province, Sar-e Pol Province, and Faryab Province), there was a loss of about 84% of cattle from 1997 to 2002 and around 80% of sheep and goat. The majority of Afghans traditionally raise sheep instead of goats because goat meat is not popular in Afghanistan. After 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation & Livestock (Afghanistan) with assistance from USAID have been helping to regrow livestock numbers throughout the country. This was done by providing Afghan villagers training and animals to start with. The Council of Ministers (Afghanistan) Mohammad Asef Rahimi stated that over the past decade arable land had increased from 2.1 million hectares to 8.1 million hectares, wheat production from 5.1 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes, nurseries from 75,000 hectares to 119,000 hectares and grape production from 364,000 tonnes to 615,000 tonnes. Almond production jumped from 19,000 to 56,000 tonnes and cotton from 20,000 to 45,000 tonnes, with the saffron yield reaching 2,000 kilograms.

Hacking your Xbox: So easy, even a 5-year-old could do it? A San Diego boy has the gaming world's attention after he exposed a security flaw that let him log into his dad's Xbox Live account, without permission, on the family's Xbox One console. \\"I was like ... yeah!\\" young Kristoffer Von Hassel said to KGTV-10, a CNN affiliate. Kristoffer's father, Robert Davies, noticed soon after Christmas that his son was logging into his account and playing games that weren't appropriate for his age. When he asked how, Kristoffer showed him a hack that seems simple in retrospect but is fairly impressive considering a 5-year-old found it. Kristoffer would go to his dad's account and type in an incorrect password. That would take him to a password verifications screen, where he would simply tap the space bar repeatedly and then press \\"enter.\\" \\"How awesome is that?\\" asked Davies, who works in online security himself. \\"Just being 5 years old and being able to find a vulnerability and latch on to that.

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Publicity  offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products.

Detailed Instructions: Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. Q: X: coyote, Y: bare A:","output":"To determine the relationship between \\"coyote\\" and \\"bare\\", I will use the following approach: Step 1: Identify the meanings and semantic classes of X and Y. X (coyote) is an animal, specifically a type of North American wild canine. Y (bare) is an adjective used to describe something that lacks its natural or usual covering. Step 2: Check for HYPER relationship. A HYPER relationship would imply that X is a specific instance of Y. Since \\"coyote\\" is an animal and \\"bare\\" is an adjective describing a state, there is no HYPER relationship between the two words. Step 3: Check for COORD relationship. A COORD relationship occurs when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. In this case, \\"coyote\\" belongs to the semantic class of animals, while \\"bare\\" belongs to the semantic class of adjectives, specifically those describing a state. Since these are different semantic classes, there is no COORD relationship between the two words.

Dufresne acknowledges Vonn's reputation for toughness and competitiveness, describing her as \\"tougher than a 1 steak and one of the most competitive athletes I have ever covered.\\" He believes it would be unwise to doubt Vonn's determination to make a comeback. The injury was certainly a significant setback for the skier, as she suffered tears in both her ACL and MCL in her right knee, along with a break in her shinbone. As a result, she will not be able to compete for the remainder of the current season.

Movie title: Enemy of the State Movie plot: In the 1990s, U.S. National Security Agency official Thomas Bryan Reynolds (Jon Voight) meets with U.S. Congressman Phil Hammersley (R-NY) (Jason Robards) in a public park to discuss support for new counter-terrorism legislation the U.S. Congress is pushing that dramatically expands the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies on individuals and groups. Hammersley remains committed to blocking its passage, since he believes it would almost totally destroy the privacy of American citizens. Reynolds, determined to have the bill pass so as to gain a long-delayed and anticipated promotion, has his team murder Hammersley, spread heart pills over his car, place him in the car and push it in a lake to make it look like he had a heart attack. In the aftermath, they discover too late that wildlife researcher Daniel Zavits (Jason Lee) had a camera aimed in the woods at their location. Zavits inspects the footage and, realizing he has captured the congressman's murder, calls a journalist he knows. The call is monitored by Reynold's team who attempt to break into his apartment to retrieve the tape. Realizing he is in grave danger, he transfers the video to a ZIP disc and places it into an NEC Turbo handheld before fleeing the apartment ahead of Reynolds's men. Zavits is eventually killed when he runs into the street in front of a fire truck but immediately prior, he bumped into an old college friend, labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), and slipped the disc into his shopping bag without his knowledge. When the NSA discovers that Dean might have the video, Reynolds's team raids his house and plants surveillance devices, but the video does not turn up. The NSA then disseminates false evidence to implicate Dean of working with the mob family of Boss Paulie Pintero (Tom Sizemore) and seeing Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet), an ex-girlfriend he had an affair with.

I read this background article the other day: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that various life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods are interconnected. Aristotle's theory suggests relationships between adult body mass, brood size, lifespan, gestation period, and fecundity. In the new situation presented, we are given the following information about tetA and tetB: 1. An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB. 2. A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. According to Aristotle's theory: 1. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass. Therefore, since tetA is heavier than tetB, tetA will have fewer offspring per brood than tetB. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. Given that tetA has a longer gestation period and is heavier than tetB, it can be inferred that tetA has a longer lifespan than tetB. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. This means that long-lived species, such as tetA, will have fewer offspring in total than short-lived species like tetB. Based on these relationships and the given information about tetA and tetB, we can conclude that tetB would have more offspring in their lifetime than tetA. This conclusion is derived from the fact that tetA has greater body mass, a longer gestation period, and consequently, a longer lifespan. These factors result in tetA having fewer offspring per brood and lower fecundity, leading to fewer total offspring throughout their lifetime as compared to tetB."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The craftsmanship was impeccable, and I could sense the residual energy that had been imbued into the wood. \\"Do you think she's targeting you specifically, or is this just the beginning of something much bigger?\\" I questioned, my curiosity piqued. Saylor shook her head, her dark hair framing her face as she looked up at me with worried eyes. \\"I wish I knew, but whatever it is, we need to be prepared.\\" I nodded in agreement, sliding the box back into her hand. \\"Let's retrace our steps. After your wards gave way, did you feel anything different? Any signs that could help us understand her motives?\\" Saylor thought for a moment before responding. \\"I did feel a sudden heaviness in the air, and a strange, icy-cold sensation washed over me. It seemed like the temperature in the room plummeted for a few seconds, and then everything returned to normal.\\" \\"A sudden drop in temperature could indicate a significant energy shift,\\" I mused, recalling some of the things I had learned from my grandmother, who was skilled in the art of energy manipulation. \\"We should start looking for any unusual occurrences around us. It might give us a clue as to what she's planning.\\" Over the next week, we began to make note of any strange events or odd happenings. We talked to friends and acquaintances, visited local community centers, and scoured the internet for any signs of trouble. Our search led us to a pattern of unexplained incidents – a sudden increase in thefts, mysterious power outages, and a rise in the number of people reporting feelings of unease or paranoia. As we started to piece together the puzzle, it became abundantly clear that something sinister was in the works. Whoever this woman was, she had infiltrated our lives in a way that created a ripple effect, subtly affecting everyone around her and unleashing a chaotic energy that permeated the entire city. As Saylor and I sat in our apartment, poring over the information we had gathered, it seemed for a moment as though we were at a dead end. The woman who had somehow managed to break through Saylor's wards was still a shadowy figure, her intentions unknown. But we knew that we couldn't give up. It was our responsibility to do everything we could to protect ourselves and the people around us from whatever plan she had set into motion. So, taking a deep breath, we delved further into the world of energy manipulation and protective charms, determined to learn all we could about how to strengthen our defenses. We attended workshops and seminars, consulted with experts, and even sought the guidance of our ancestors, who had dealt with similar threats in the distant past. As the weeks passed, we grew stronger and more knowledgeable. Our resolve to stop this woman and restore balance to our city only grew more steadfast. And as we continued on our journey, we also discovered an inner strength we would need to face the trials that still lay ahead. It was only a matter of time before we would come face to face with the person responsible for the unraveling chaos around us. But with our newfound knowledge and powerful determination, we were ready for whatever challenges lay ahead of us, and we were prepared to defend our home and our community, no matter the cost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?, using the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the information given in the article, the answer to the question \\"Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?\\" cannot be definitively determined, as it is not specifically mentioned. However, we know that Moore began his artistic education at the Leeds School of Art and later studied at the Royal College of Art in London. It is likely that he encountered timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool at one of these institutions, but the precise location is not provided in the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Police have made a second arrest, a 16-year-old boy from west London, in connection with the investigation into an alleged data theft from TalkTalk. He was held on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, and later bailed, after detectives searched an address in Feltham, Scotland Yard said. On Monday, a 15-year-old boy was arrested and bailed in Northern Ireland in connection with the hacking. The Metropolitan Police said officers had searched a residential address in Liverpool. In an update on its website, TalkTalk also said hackers had accessed a maximum of 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details, with the middle six digits removed, and 15,000 customer dates of birth. The phone and broadband provider, which has more than four million UK customers, said it would be writing to all affected customers to let them know what information had been accessed. It said that any stolen credit or debit card details were incomplete - and therefore could not be used for financial transactions - but advised customers to remain vigilant against fraud.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Article: Over the holidays, I took my three young children into a fancy chocolate shop to buy gifts. Halfway home, I noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic noisemaker. Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool -- even when he said, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" --and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his piggy bank. He walked embarrassedly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry to break it and that he would pay for it now. I know exactly how terrible he was feeling. Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. \\"Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,\\" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. \\"Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them.\\" And stay calm when you set them. \\"If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,\\" she  says. Having a child physically return the stolen item helps him or her grasp the situation -- and the consequence. But don't talk about it for too long. \\"lf you continuously bring up the incident, the child will believe they' re a thief and that they' re bad,\\" she says. Only time will tell if this experience will have the same powerful effect on my son as it had on me, but at the same time I can rest if I haven' t dealt with the situation badly. Question: When the author' s son was caught playing with a stolen toy, he  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"didn't think it was a big deal\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"didn't think it was a big deal.\\" When the author's son was caught playing with the stolen toy, he initially tried to downplay the situation by saying, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" This response suggests that he didn't think it was a big deal or a significant problem. However, the author used the opportunity to teach their son an important lesson about stealing and its consequences. The fact that the son was made to return the stolen item to the store and apologize for his actions helps him understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of abiding by societal rules and norms. Additionally, according to Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist, intervening in such a situation is crucial to developing a child's understanding of right from wrong. Parents should remain calm and composed while handling the situation to prevent the child from becoming more fascinated by or defiant against the behavior. It's important not to overemphasize the incident or continuously bring it up to avoid the child developing a negative self-image or believing they are inherently bad. In the end, only time will tell if this experience has the same powerful, transformative effect on the author's son as it had on the author themselves. But by taking the appropriate steps to address the situation and communicate the importance of respecting property and ownership, the author can feel confident they didn't handle the situation badly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next, I created a variable to store the sum of the numerical elements found in the range between positions i and j: sum_numerical_elements = 0 Then, I looped through the elements of the list A between positions i and j (including i and j) using a for loop: for element in A[i:j+1]:     # Check if the element is an integer (numerical)     if element.isdigit():         # If it's a numerical element, add its value to the sum         sum_numerical_elements += int(element) In this case, the elements in the range i to j are 's', '7361', '4091', '9583', '2621'.

Question: \\"How can this be put into practice?\\"  Context: \\"The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart. In this paper McTaggart proposes two \\"temporal series\\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In order to put McTaggart's concepts of the A-series and B-series into practice, we need to first understand the theoretical framework and then explore practical applications in various fields. Here, we will discuss a few steps to implement these ideas: 1. Deepen the understanding of A-series and B-series: The first step towards implementing these concepts is to gain a thorough understanding of the differences between the two temporal series. The A-series is based on the notion of temporal becoming, where events are categorized as past, present, or future. On the other hand, the B-series removes the reference to present and focuses solely on the relations of 'earlier than' and 'later than' among events. 2. Identify relevant domains: It is essential to identify domains in which the concepts of the A-series and B-series can be practically applied. Some potential fields include philosophy, physics, cognitive science, and psychology. 3. Apply the concepts in philosophy and metaphysics: Explore how McTaggart's concepts of A-series and B-series can be used to understand issues in metaphysics such as time travel, the nature of time, and the problem of change. It is important to consider the implications and consequences of these concepts when applied to specific philosophical debates, such as eternalism, presentism, and the growing block view of time. 4. Apply the concepts in physics: In the field of physics, researchers can study the role of A-series and B-series concepts in understanding the nature of time and its relation to space or spacetime. This may involve using these concepts to analyze different physical theories, such as the general theory of relativity, and examining the implications on our understanding of the progression of time. 5. Apply the concepts in cognitive science: Investigate the ways in which the A-series and B-series concepts can be used to gain insight into human cognition and perceptions of time. This could involve studying how the concepts may play a role in the mental representation of time, the encoding and retrieval of time-related information in memory, and how individuals perceive durations and temporal order. 6. Apply the concepts in psychology: In psychology, explore the role of A-series and B-series concepts in the human experience of time. Investigate the psychological effects of focusing on temporal becoming (A-series) versus focusing on the relations between events (B-series). Examine how such temporal perspectives might influence emotions, decision-making, and behavior. 7. Develop tools and methods: As the concepts are applied to various disciplines, it is crucial to develop tools and methods that can help practitioners effectively incorporate the A-series and B-series into their research and practice. This may involve creating models, simulations, or analytical frameworks to better understand and implement these concepts. 8. Continuous assessment and integration: Finally, it is vital to continuously assess the impact and effectiveness of applying the A-series and B-series concepts in various fields. Researchers and practitioners should collaborate to refine and integrate the theories, share their findings, and encourage interdisciplinary approaches that can uncover new insights into the nature of time and its implications. By following these steps and engaging in multidisciplinary collaboration, the concepts of A-series and B-series can be effectively put into practice, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the nature of time and its implications on our lives and the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef!  \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\"  Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\"  Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year. Some vegetarians insist they should never eat meat -- even if it grew on a tree. Others love the idea. \\"My mouth is watering already,\\" says a devoted vegetarian of 20 years.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the drink made from sorghum and urwagwa in the cuisine that is based on local staple foods? ?  The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.

I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term.

A similar path would make the","output":"most sense for other conflict-ridden nations and regions around the world, as true security and stability can only be achieved through mutual understanding, cooperation, and a genuine desire to address the needs and grievances of all parties involved. Building trust and rapport among various factions within a society, rather than exacerbating division, is crucial in fostering a lasting peace that benefits all. For example, the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir have given rise to numerous armed conflicts and continued unrest over the years. Both nations could prioritize diplomatic efforts, such as initiating comprehensive dialogues that address key issues, including demilitarization, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges. By doing so, they might foster an environment that would enable a peaceful and mutually beneficial resolution to the conflict. Similarly, the ongoing crisis in Syria, which has led to immense suffering and displacement of millions of individuals, necessitates a multifaceted approach that addresses both the immediate humanitarian concerns and the underlying political and economic factors feeding the conflict. This could entail establishing formal channels for open negotiations among the opposing factions, providing assistance for the reconstruction of devastated communities, and creating opportunities for Syrians to participate in the rebuilding of their nation. Countries dealing with internal strife, such as Yemen or South Sudan, could also benefit from working towards equitable and inclusive governance systems that ensure the representation of various ethnic, religious, and political groups. This would require the establishment of dialogues, power-sharing agreements, and measures that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights. By building bridges instead of walls, these nations could foster reconciliation and pave the way for peace and prosperity. Furthermore, in cases where external forces have a significant influence on the conflict, such as the United States in Afghanistan or Russia in Ukraine, it is essential for these powers not to exacerbate tensions but rather to take on a more constructive role in the peace process. This may involve promoting diplomatic channels and regional cooperation, as well as providing support for rebuilding infrastructure, ensuring the safety and security of local populations, and fostering economic development. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage would be to assert that adopting a similar approach as proposed for Israel – prioritizing peace, mutual understanding, and respect for the rights and dignity of all parties involved – can contribute to resolving conflicts more effectively and sustainably than attempts to dominate or marginalize opposing factions. By recognizing that the fate and well-being of all communities involved in these disputes are intrinsically linked, nations and powerful entities across the world can work collectively toward creating a more just, equitable, and secure global order."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: First of all, you must stop whatever are you doing in that moment and sit down; after a few minutes of rest, the cramps should decrease in intensity or even disappear.  If the pain lasts longer or they are really intense,  call your doctor and tell him or her about  your symptoms because it might be a more serious problem. Sometimes it helps to lean a little bit to the side that hurts; this way, you can relax the muscles in that area and reduce the pain you feel. To relieve a cramp in your leg, lie on your back momentarily and then extend the affected leg while keeping the knee straight. Try to position yourself so that the foot is bent backwards until the pain is gone.  Another means of stretching the legs is by riding a stationary bike for 30 minutes daily. Brisk walking is also a way of improving circulation in the lower extremities. You might be tempted to use some medication for treating the pain; it is very important to know that many of the drugs used today, unfortunately, may have severe adverse or teratogenic effects (they can lead to congenital malformations or other abnormalities).  Because of this, it is important to check with your doctor before using any over-the-counter medications.  Consider taking acetaminophen (the brand name is Tylenol) because it is considered a safe drug to take during pregnancy. The recommended dosage is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours (unless stated otherwise by your physician).  Another frequently used drug for pain relief is ibuprofen (Nurofen and other trademarks); this must be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester because it promotes premature closure of a fetal structure called ductus arteriosus (DA). You might try to reduce the pain by applying a warm compress to the area where you are experiencing cramps. However, be careful not to keep it against your skin for too long as it may cause nerve damage to your skin. Once you begin to feel relief, remove the warm compress.  You can apply the warm compress to the area again if the cramps come back. You can also consider taking a warm bath rather than using a warm compress.

CEOs lead a range of organizations, including public and private corporations, non-profit organizations and even some government organizations (e.g., Crown corporations). The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity, which may include maximizing the share price, market share, revenues, or another element. In the non-profit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization's mission, such as reducing poverty, increasing literacy, etc. Titles also often given to the holder of CEO position include president, chief executive (CE) and managing director (MD).  - A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of a country, typically a republic, a democracy, or a dictatorship.

Reese is known mainly for his work on medieval and Renaissance music, particularly with his two publications \\"Music in the Middle Ages\\" (1940) and \\"Music in the Renaissance\\" (1954); these two books remain the standard reference works for these two eras, with complete and precise bibliographical material, allowing for almost every piece of music mentioned to be traced back to a primary source.  - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature).

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Larger and deeper breaths may have an indirect effect on the process of bacterial infection leading to more severe disease. Here's a possible sequence of events that could occur due to this perturbation: 1. Larger, deeper breaths can increase the amount of oxygen inhaled, which may then increase blood oxygen levels. 2. Increased oxygen levels in the blood can improve the efficiency of the immune system and aid in the production of immune cells. 3. A stronger immune response may help the body detect and combat the bacterial infection more quickly and effectively, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 4. Larger, deeper breaths could also facilitate the removal of toxins and waste products through more effective respiration and circulation. 5. Improved respiratory function can also facilitate the clearance of bacteria and infections from the respiratory tract, further contributing to a faster and more efficient immune response. Overall, the perturbation of larger, deeper breaths can have an indirect effect on the process of bacterial infection and the development of severe disease. By potentially improving immune function and respiratory tract clearance, this perturbation might contribute to a reduced severity of the disease. However, the outcome would depend on various factors, including the individual's overall health, immune system strength, and the type of bacteria involved in the infection."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  The story begins in 1957 in the star-filled skies above California's Mojave Desert.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What group did the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts contribute to their album? , can you please find it?   After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Salt Lake City Airport  for the following movie plot:  Columbia Air Lines' Flight 409 is a Boeing 747-100 on a red-eye route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals? , can you please find it?   John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two distinct questions, addressing separate aspects related to two notable wrestling figures, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Let me provide a detailed answer for each question. Question 1: What is the history of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship? The relationship between Triple H (born Paul Levesque) and Stephanie McMahon (born Stephanie Marie McMahon) stretches back over two decades. Their journey started as a scripted romantic storyline in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and has grown into an authentic lifelong partnership both personally and professionally. The roots of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship can be traced back to the late 1990s within the WWE. In 1999, a storyline commenced where Triple H and Stephanie McMahon became an on-screen couple. This included the infamous \\"Vegas Wedding\\" angle in which Triple H drugged and married a seemingly unconscious Stephanie McMahon as part of a rivalry with her father, Vince McMahon. As they continued working together, their on-screen chemistry evolved into a real-life romance. By 2000, the pair had become an influential couple within WWE, joining forces to create the villainous faction known as \\"The McMahon-Helmsley Era.\\" This on-screen partnership continued until 2002 when they \\"divorced\\" as part of the storyline. Despite their on-screen separation, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's real-life relationship continued to flourish. They got engaged in 2003 and were married on October 25, 2003, becoming a power couple both in and out of the ring. Throughout the years, they have supported each other's careers, with Triple H becoming an executive vice president, while Stephanie has risen through the ranks to become the current WWE Chief Brand Officer. They also have an impressive in-ring legacy, with numerous championship belts and accomplishments between them. Beyond the wrestling world, the couple has three daughters and actively participates in various philanthropic and charity ventures. Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, has held numerous executive positions within the company over the years and has been an influential figure in WWE creative decisions. Currently, Stephanie McMahon serves as the WWE Chief Brand Officer, focusing primarily on elevating the brand's image, expanding the company's global reach, and developing strategic partnerships. However, it's essential to recognize that the WWE creative process involves multiple individuals and layers of approval. Although Stephanie plays an on-screen character and carries significant influence as a member of the McMahon family, she doesn't solely dictate the creative content of WWE programming. Instead, the WWE creative team, consisting of writers and producers, develops the creative direction for WWE storylines and character arcs. Ideas usually flow through a chain of command, with input from several individuals, including Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, and ultimately, Vince McMahon, who has the final say in most creative decisions. Despite her primary focus as the Chief Brand Officer and not directly overseeing the creative team, it's clear that Stephanie McMahon, with her deep-rooted connection to the business and on-screen role, would likely have some input and say in creative decisions. Her experience as a performer and WWE executive makes her a valuable resource in offering suggestions and helping to shape the overall direction of storylines and character development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the statement \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee\\" is not a reasonable answer to your question. This statement merely reveals where the Florida legislature meets, but does not furnish any information about how often it is in session.  A more suitable answer to your question is as follows: The frequency of the Florida Legislature's sessions is regulated by the state constitution. Regular sessions commence on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and last 60 calendar days, which are consecutive unless otherwise provided by law. This means that the Florida Legislature is in session for a total of 60 days every year in a regular session.  However, it's important to note that special sessions called by the governor or decided upon by the leadership of both houses may occur. These special sessions can take place at any time of the year and typically address urgent legislative issues that cannot wait until the next regular session. They cannot exceed 20 days, unless extended by a three-fifths vote of each house.  Furthermore, the legislature also participates in committee weeks for several months before the regular session. During these committee weeks, legislators meet to discuss, write and pass bills that are then formally introduced during the regular session. These committee weeks typically start in September or October and end when the regular session begins in March. Despite meeting formally for a short period each year, the specific work of the Florida legislature is ongoing throughout the year as they prepare bills, conduct research, analyze budgets, engage with constituents, and participate in interim committee meetings.  So, to summarize, while the formal legislative session in Florida happens for 60 consecutive calendar days starting in March each year, the work of the legislature is continuous throughout the year with possible special sessions and committee weeks preceding the regular session."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Logan had to remind Benjamin to take the medicine because","output":"Benjamin was quite forgetful when it came to his daily routines, especially with something as important as his prescription medications. It wasn't out of sheer negligence, but rather a combination of his busy schedule, numerous responsibilities, and admittedly a bit of absent-mindedness. Logan and Benjamin had been friends since their early years, forging a strong bond like brothers. As they grew older, they continued to support one another through thick and thin. This bond only strengthened when Benjamin fell ill, necessitating a strict medication schedule to keep his condition in check. Logan took it upon himself to be his friend's caretaker and staunch advocate in this trying phase of his life. A sense of protectiveness enveloped Logan, and he was determined to never miss a dose. Consequently, he developed a system to remind Benjamin about the medication he needed. The two would coexist in harmony, with Logan's constant supervision ensuring that Benjamin's well-being was taken care of. Logan's method began with an established morning ritual. Before they would part ways for their respective jobs, he would emphasize to Benjamin the importance of taking his medicine. He would frame these reminders in a light-hearted yet firm manner, knowing that scolding or disappointed tones wouldn't be helpful. This exchange became the centerpiece of their daily interactions, as it was an essential task that Logan hoped would eventually become second nature for Benjamin. Digital reminders also played an important role in Logan's strategy. He would use text messages, phone alarms, and even calendar notifications to ensure Benjamin stayed on track. These digital nudges complimented the habitual morning conversation the duo shared. Over time, Logan realized that it wasn't just the reminders that were crucial, but also creating opportunities for Benjamin to share any apprehensions or concerns about his diagnosis and medications. He gave Benjamin room to express his fears and frustrations when needed, fostering understanding and camaraderie between the two. Logan emphasized the importance of organization when it came to storing Benjamin's medications. A pillbox organizer was purchased, where morning and evening doses were separated and stored in a chronological manner. This way, Benjamin had an easy time remembering which medicine he had taken and which were still pending. In spite of his best efforts, Logan acknowledged that setbacks could still occur. He made sure that an open line of communication existed between the two friends, so that whenever an issue arose, it could be tackled on the spot. He reiterated to Benjamin that missing a single dose wasn't the end of the world, but it was important to strive for consistency. As Logan continued to remind Benjamin to take his medicine, he saw a gradual transformation in his friend's self-discipline. Over time, Benjamin grew more in tune with his body and health, which in turn helped him become more proactive about his condition. The unwavering dedication Logan demonstrated in reminding Benjamin about his medications turned into a pivotal element of their bond. It became a testament to their friendship, proving that through solidarity and compassion, loving friends could endure and conquer life's countless obstacles together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dining table could become a relic of. the past as nearly a third of Britons now confess to eating there only a. few times a year. New research suggests that the number of us who now eat at our dining or kitchen table is shockingly low. Just five per cent of those polled ate every meal at the table, compared with 13 per cent of those who ate at least one meal a day there. The traditional scene of a family sitting to enjoy a meal together may become a thing of the past, as a third only use their table a few times a year. Almost a fifth of respondents (19 per cent) said that they ate one or two meals a week at the dining or kitchen table. Over a quarter, 26 per cent, of those surveyed confessed to eating at the table no less than once or twice a month and nearly a third (30 per cent) admitted to using it just a few times a year. Only four per cent said they never ate any meals at the table whilst three per cent said they didn’t even own one. Sitting down to meals has been replaced by eating on the go to keep up with fast paced modern lifestyles. A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research commented: ‘Compared to 40 years ago, we now live in a society which moves at an extremely fast pace. Often, breakfast has to be eaten on the go, and in many cases so does lunch. 1.    Every meal - 5%. 2.    At least one meal a day - 13%. 3.    At least once or twice a week - 19%. 4.    At least once or twice a month - 26%. 5.    A few times a year - 30%. 6.    Never - 4%. 7.    Don’t have a dining/kitchen table - 3%. ‘Also, with people working longer hours, a quick ready meal or a takeaway in front of the TV is the easiest option.’ One woman said: ‘I always make sure my children eat at the dining table, but once you’ve got home from work, fed them and put them to bed, it’s all you can do to crash out in front of the TV with a jacket potato. ‘I can remember always having meals at the table, but then again my mum was a homemaker and had the time to prepare everything.’ Another man commented: ‘I hardly ever eat at the table, I think the only times I do are at Christmas and Easter. ‘In fact the only table I regularly eat at is my desk in the office when I am having my lunch.’ One final respondent said of the poll: ‘I am really worried that my children are growing up in a society where eating meals at the table is something special and not the norm. ‘What does it say about family life in this country if all we can do at meal times is sit and watch the television while stuffing our faces.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the decline of eating meals at dining tables among Britons, with a third admitting to using the table only a few times a year.

The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Retired solicitor Donald Lock was stabbed 39 times on the A24 at Findon, West Sussex, last July. Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted killing Mr Lock, claiming diminished responsibility. In an video played at Lewes Crown Court he told police he saw Mr Lock in his rear view mirror looking \\"very angry\\". \\"I just saw someone very close and very angry and I wanted that scenario to stop because it was intrusive,\\" said Mr Daley. \\"It was aggressive. I know some people drive close sometimes but this person was very, very close and I didn't know why. \\"I thought he would see my red lights and think maybe he shouldn't be driving so close to me, because that's not how people are supposed to drive.\\" The pensioner's widow, Maureen Lock, left the courtroom when Mr Daley showed police during the interview how he had stabbed her husband. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of the defendant's Ford Fusion in July and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Mr Daley continued: \\"I'm not happy that the man has died. I'm not happy that in the final minutes of his life he was in that much pain, and I don't want to be reminded of it. \\"I feel very sorry about what I have done and I don't want to see anything like that happen in my lifetime again.\\" When he was asked why he did not stop stabbing Mr Lock after he fell to the ground, he replied: \\"It's as if his anger has been put on to me and I'm trying to get rid of it.\\" When asked why he had to use a knife, Mr Daley said it was \\"in his mind to protect himself\\". He also said he had stopped taking medication to help him sleep a year before the attack. During the interview he said he had recently split up from his girlfriend but was \\"making efforts to win her back\\". Jurors have been told Mr Daley had suffered from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \\"pleaded\\" with mental health experts to have him sectioned. Defence counsel David Howker QC told the court he would not be calling Mr Daley to give evidence, but added: \\"There is other evidence to call.\\" The court heard Mr Daley saw consultant forensic psychiatrist Jake Harvey the day after the killing and told him he felt he had been getting less help with his mental health, was being seen by \\"too many trainee nurses\\", and had not been taking an anti-psychotic drug he had previously been prescribed. He described hearing \\"so many juvenile voices running through my head\\" which he said were \\"angry\\" and \\"overwhelming\\", jurors heard.

Consultant clinical psychologist Dr Michael Lawson assessed Mr Daley in November 2015 when he was admitted to Hellingly medium-secure unit. He said his primary diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia and exaggerated autistic traits. He said: \\"My conclusion was that at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Daley was in all likelihood beginning to break down and experiencing the acute symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, although I don't think he was at the point of being incapacitated.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

The letter tells the heartfelt story of how different generations react to the news that a family member is gay, but in this instance it is the older generation telling their offspring that they need to show more compassion. In the letter, the grandfather passionately addresses his daughter Christine's decision to kick her son, Chad, out of their home after he has told her that he’s gay. An unnamed grandfather has received a host of online plaudits after his impassioned letter of support for his gay grandson Chad was posted online on Monday. Christine's father doesn’t hold back in letting his daughter know how extremely disappointed he is with her reaction to her own flesh and blood. 'You’re correct that we have a \\"shame in the family,\\" but mistaken about what it is,' he blasts her. He goes on to call her actions 'the real \\"abomination\\" here' and that a parent disowning her child is what really goes 'against nature.'

Article: When a computer works on a group of programs,it can get very hot.Cooling the computer can cost a lot.So some scientists wonder what would happen if the heat from the computer could beused. Large Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft have thousands of computers.As these computers deal with information,they produce lots of heat,so they need huge cooling systems .These systems send the heat in to the air. A company in Holland thinks paying to make the computers work and then paying again to cool them are a waste of energy.So the company developed a special device-thee-Radiator. Boaz Leupe,head of the company,says that e-Radiator works as a heating system and saves money.He explains that the energy is used twice-once to heat the home and once to cool the computer and that the users don't have to pay to cool their computers. Five homeowners in Holland are testing the heating system in their homes. \\"We pay for the computer using,so,in that way,homeowners get heating for free,\\"Boaz says.Jan Visser is one of the homeowners.\\"If you use the computer more,the e-Radiator producers more heat,\\"he says,\\"It cannot provide enough heat if you don't use your computer often.\\"But he is ready to try it.It's a great help for his family.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels   at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios  _  . - spend a lot money on computers - use a lot of common sound in films - use computers for everyday sounds - give Foley artists a lot of new ideas Answer:","output":"Most modern studios use computers for everyday sounds. The article explains that in the past, creating \\"everyday\\" sounds was labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring a Foley artist's expertise and imagination to replicate these noises. However, with technological advancements, these sounds are now readily available and generated through computer software. This shift in method not only alleviates the pressure on Foley artists but also allows them to dedicate more of their time to creating unusual sound effects. The automation of everyday sound production has therefore streamlined efficiencies and reduced stress within film studio environments."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Available choices:  * no.  * yes.","output":"Bridget Marquardt, an American television personality, gained fame primarily as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends in the reality TV show \\"The Girls Next Door.\\" She underwent several plastic surgery procedures throughout the years; however, it is essential to note that any specific procedures are speculative and have not been officially confirmed by Marquardt herself. Some of the rumored plastic surgery procedures that Bridget Marquardt is believed to have undergone include: 1. Breast augmentation: It was rumored that Marquardt had breast implants early in her career, supposedly increasing her breasts size. 2. Rhinoplasty (nose job): Some people speculated that she had her nose refined, as there seems to be a difference in the shape of her nose in later pictures compared to earlier ones. 3. Botox injections: It is assumed that Marquardt might have had Botox injections to maintain her youthful appearance, which leads to the reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. 4. Lip fillers: Observers of Marquardt's transformation have also suggested that she may have had her lips subtly enhanced using lip fillers, resulting in fuller and more defined lips. As for the second question about getting plastic surgery in Korea, it is a personal choice heavily dependent on individual preferences, values, and circumstances. South Korea is well-known for its high-quality plastic surgery clinics, skilled surgeons, and advanced techniques. However, before making a decision, there are few things you should consider: 1. Research: Thoroughly research the specific surgery or procedure you want to undergo, possible complications, and expected outcomes. 2. Choose the right clinic and surgeon: Take the time to choose an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon and a reputable clinic to attain the best possible results. 3. Cost: Plastic surgery can be expensive, and the costs can vary depending on the procedure and the clinic you select. Consider whether you can afford the procedure and if it is worth the investment. 4. Recovery time: Some procedures require an extensive recovery period that could interfere with your work, personal life, or travel plans. Ensure you have the time and support necessary for a smooth recovery. 5. Psychological impact: Plastic surgery can have profound emotional and mental effects on individuals. Be aware of these potential consequences and ensure that you have the proper support to deal with them. Regarding the multi-choice problem, the correct choice is \\"no.\\" The two questions are not the same. The first question inquires about the specific plastic surgery procedures Bridget Marquardt underwent, while the second question is a query about whether the person should opt for plastic surgery in Korea.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person whose tenure in in Mühlhausen was from 1706 to 1708?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

Title: Monster from Green Hell Movie plot: In preparation for sending a manned rocket into space, American scientists Dr. Quent Brady and Dan Morgan are put in charge of a program that sends various animals and insects into space to test their survival rates. After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mortgage delinquency rate declines, but is still high Some 5.78% of the nation's mortgage holders were behind on their payments 60 days or more in the January-to-March quarter, credit reporting agency TransUnion said Wednesday. That's down from 6.19% in the period last year, and below the 6.01% delinquency rate for the last three months of 2011. The decline in the U.S. mortgage delinquency rate follows two quarters of increases. But barring any severe shocks to the U.S. economy, the rate is expected to continue easing, says Tim Martin, group vice president of U.S. Housing for TransUnion. \\"We had a couple quarters where it ticked up, so it's nice to see it come back down,\\" Martin said. \\"That should be what happens the rest of the year, so we're hopefully on the path of improvement now.\\" TransUnion's analysis is derived from a sample of 10% of U.S. mortgage holders. Before the housing bust, mortgage delinquencies were running at less than 2% nationally. It took about three years after the housing market crashed for the delinquency rate on mortgages to climb to a peak of nearly 7% in the fourth quarter 2009. The rate has been trending down since then. Seasonal patterns — such as homeowners skipping payments to spend money elsewhere in the last three months of the year — were likely a factor in the uptick last fall. Still, the national delinquency rate remains well above its historical range, an indication many homeowners are still struggling five years after the housing downturn. \\"It's coming down a lot more slowly than it went back up,\\" Martin said. The delinquency rate won't likely get back down to its normal 2% level until housing prices recover. Home prices dropped in February in most major U.S. cities for a sixth-straight month, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index. Still, there have been some bright spots in housing and economic trends this year that could point to further improvement in the mortgage delinquency rate. The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since August to 8.1% last month — lowest since January 2009. Hiring has strengthened, despite posting weaker-than-anticipated gains in March and April. And the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter, aided by stronger consumer spending. And while sales of previously owned homes fell in March, a mild winter drove gains in January and February, making this year's winter the best for home sales in five years. As long as the economy, housing market and jobs outlook continue to improve, it's likely fewer homeowners will fall behind on their mortgage payments, Martin said. Another factor: Loans made between 2008 and 2011, after the housing crisis began, have a lower delinquency rate than older loans. \\"As time goes on, they become a bigger and bigger percentage of the total, so that helps bring the rates down as well,\\" Martin said. All but eight states saw their mortgage delinquency rate decline in the first quarter vs. the last three months of last year: Montana, Hawaii, Maine, North Dakota, New York, Maryland, Washington and Delaware. Florida led the nation with the highest mortgage delinquency rate 13.87%, down from 14.27% in the fourth quarter last year. The Sunshine State wasn't the only foreclosure hotbed where mortgage delinquency improved in the first quarter. The mortgage delinquency rate in Arizona was 6.86%, down from 7.50% in the fourth quarter of 2011. California's declined to 6.66% from 7.14%, while Nevada's fell to 11.16% from 12.08%. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The number of people who have not paid their mortgage for 60 days or more has gone down, but it's still more than it should be.

Perfume intolerance or perfume allergy is a condition wherein people exhibit sensitivity or allergic reactions to ingredients in some perfumes and some other fragrances. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: is it possible to be allergic to perfume? Possible answers: A). no B). yes","output":"B). yes It is indeed possible to be allergic to perfume, as the condition called perfume intolerance or perfume allergy demonstrates. This condition occurs when individuals display sensitivity or allergic reactions to certain ingredients present in some perfumes or other fragrances. Perfume intolerance can manifest through various symptoms, such as skin irritation, respiratory issues, or headaches. Perfume intolerance or allergy may be triggered by natural or synthetic ingredients found in perfumes, including essential oils, synthetic fragrances, and various other chemicals. In some cases, people might be affected by specific ingredients or substances, while others may be sensitive to a combination of ingredients. This varying degree of sensitivity can further contribute to the wide range of symptoms and reactions experienced by individuals. When individuals with perfume intolerance or allergy come into contact with the fragrance ingredients, their immune system may recognize these substances as harmful or foreign. This reaction results in the production of antibodies and the release of chemicals like histamine, which can cause allergic symptoms such as itching, redness, swelling, and congestion. To prevent or manage perfume intolerance or allergy, people should identify the specific ingredients or fragrances that trigger their symptoms. This can be achieved through patch testing, which involves applying small amounts of various fragrance components to the skin to observe their reactions. Once the problematic ingredients are identified, individuals should avoid products containing these substances, opting for fragrance-free or hypoallergenic alternatives instead. It is essential to raise awareness about perfume intolerance or allergy, as it can significantly impact individuals' quality of life. By understanding this condition and taking appropriate measures to prevent symptoms, one can better navigate environments with potentially triggering fragrances and ensure their well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the train platform, Sam Beasley (Arthur O'Connell) speaks with Link briefly, rousing the suspicions of the town marshal, Sam being a known con man. When the marshal comments that Link looks familiar, Link gives him a false name. Aboard the train, Sam impulsively joins Link, learns of his mission in Fort Worth and claims he can be of help. Sam introduces him to the Crosscut saloon singer, Billie Ellis (Julie London), insisting she could make an ideal teacher. Their conversation is overheard by Alcutt, a shady-looking passenger. When the train stops to pick up wood for additional fuel, male passengers help load the train but Alcutt remains on board, feigning sleep. He signals three other men, Coaley Tobin (Jack Lord), Trout (Royal Dano) and Ponch (Robert J. Wilke), who rob the train. Link tries to intervene and is knocked unconscious. The train pulls away, with Alcutt riding off with Link's bag containing Good Hope's money. Alcott is wounded as he and the robbers flee. Link revives to discover that he, Sam and Billie have been left behind, many miles from the nearest town. Link leads them on foot to a ramshackle farm, admitting that he lived there years earlier. While the others wait in the barn, Link enters the run-down house and finds the train robbers hiding inside. Coaley is suspicious of Link's claim that he simply wants to rest for the night.

President Barack Obama made a rare 2014 campaign stop on Tuesday evening in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to rally the party faithful for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. At a packed gymnasium, Obama held up Democrat Mary Burke as a skilled businesswoman who will fight for the type of middle-class opportunity that made his own success possible. Riffing on health care, the minimum wage and women's issues, Obama steered clear of referring directly to the state's Republican governor, Scott Walker, instead lumping him together with a Republican Party he accused of pushing antiquated and failed policies - such as opposition to fair pay legislation backed by Democrats. 'Wisconsin can't afford a governor who will walk lock-step with President Obama and his failed policies that have hurt our country and would take","output":"Wisconsin backwards', said Scott Walker in a statement responding to Obama's rally. The Republican incumbent argued that the state needed strong, independent leadership, not a governor who will merely toe the party line. Walker further attacked Burke's credentials as a businesswoman, alleging that her past economic decisions had proven detrimental to Wisconsin's business community. He ended his statement by reiterating his commitment to policies that support business growth and job creation in the state.  Walker's robust response indicates that the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin is heating up, with both candidates responding fiercely to each other's campaigns.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided information does not correctly answer the question about how the capital city of Brazil, Brasília, was created. The information given pertains to the city's per capita income, not its creation.  Allow me to provide a detailed and accurate answer to the question: Brasília, the capital of Brazil, was created as a result of a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek. The construction of Brasília was part of a larger plan known as \\"Plano de Metas\\" (Plan of Goals), which aimed to develop different sectors of Brazil's economy, such as energy, transport, and education, among others. The main objective of creating Brasília was to stimulate growth and development in the central-western region of Brazil, as well as to reduce the concentration of political and economic power in the coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The decision to build the new capital was based on Article 4 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, which stated the need to create a new capital in the country's interior. The idea was revisited in the 1950s during President Kubitschek's term, and the new capital was seen as a symbol of modernity and progress for Brazil. The location for the new capital was strategically chosen in the Central Plateau of Brazil, approximately 1,000 kilometers west of Rio de Janeiro. This region was chosen for its relatively flat terrain, availability of water resources, and a favorable climate. In 1956, a committee led by Marechal José Pessoa was responsible for selecting the site for Brasília. To design the new capital, a competition was held in 1956, and architects from around the world were invited to present their ideas. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer won the competition along with urban planner Lúcio Costa. Costa's design, known as the \\"Plano Piloto,\\" featured the city in the shape of an airplane, with different zones dedicated to various functions, such as residential, commercial, and administrative areas. Oscar Niemeyer, on the other hand, contributed with many iconic and modernist buildings, such as the National Congress, Cathedral, Planalto Palace, and the Alvorada Palace. The construction of Brasília started on April 20, 1956, and the city was officially inaugurated on April 21, 1960. The new capital attracted thousands of workers and settlers during the construction process, known as \\"Candangos.\\" These workers played a vital role in the city's construction, shaping its demographics, culture, and society. In summary, the creation of Brasília resulted from a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek, aiming to promote growth in the interior while reducing the power concentration in coastal cities. The capital was strategically located in the Central Plateau, and its design was selected through an international competition, with Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa shaping the city's iconic appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the person who drew Man of Sorrows?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.  That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The... Answer:","output":"The name of the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer. He was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist who lived during the Renaissance. His work displayed a high level of technical excellence and intricate detail, showcased particularly in his portraiture. As the context indicates, Dürer was greatly influenced by southern German portraiture of the late 15th century, the Early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and his own father, Albrecht the Elder. Dürer's \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is an artwork depicting Christ suffering, a theme commonly seen in Christian art during the time. It shows a deep emotional intensity and exemplifies Dürer's ability to skillfully capture complex human emotions and expressions. In the context provided, it is evident that Dürer developed his unique artistic style by blending various influences from different artistic traditions, including elements of southern German portraiture, Early Netherlandish painting techniques, and the use of silverpoint. Through his mastery of various mediums and techniques, Dürer managed to distinguish himself from his contemporaries. His attention to detail and strong focus on his subjects' faces made his work both visually striking and emotionally powerful. Additionally, his interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance is evident in his self-portraits and his portraits of his parents, which showcase the progression of aging and its impact on facial features. In conclusion, the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer, a prominent Renaissance artist known for his technical excellence and keen observational abilities.

Summarize the following: If your heart is enlarged or the walls of your heart have become thicker, this can be in indication of several problems. For example, the doctor will likely measure the thickness of the wall of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart). If it is thicker than 1.5 cm, this is considered abnormal. This or other thickened heart walls could indicate several problems including:  High blood pressure Weak heart valves Damaged valves These measures can indicate whether your heart is pumping enough blood to supply your body with the oxygen it needs. If not, you are at risk for heart failure. There are two measurements the doctor may discuss with you:  Left ventricular ejection fraction. This is the percentage of blood that is expelled from the heart during a heartbeat. A left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% is considered normal. Cardiac output. This is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. At rest the average adult's heart pumps 4.8 to 6.4 liters of blood per minute. If parts of the wall of the heart are not pumping strongly, this can help the doctor pinpoint areas that have been damaged. This can occur due to tissue damage from a prior heart attack or coronary artery disease. Your doctor will be looking for several things:  Hyperkinesis. This occurs when the heart or parts of the walls of the heart contract too much. Hypokinesis. This occurs when the contractions are too weak. Akinesis. This occurs when the tissue does not contract. Dyskinesis. This occurs when the wall of the heart bulges out when it should be contracting. You will likely be able to see the valves as gray lines that open and close with each beat of the heart enabling blood to pass between the chambers. Possible problems that you may see could be:  A valve does not close tightly and it lets blood flow backwards through it. A valve does not open all the way so it restricts blood flow. You may be able to observe structural problems such as:  Openings between chambers that should not be there Passages between the heart and blood vessels Heart defects that are developing a fetus","output":"An enlarged or thickened heart can indicate issues such as high blood pressure, weak or damaged valves, potentially leading to heart failure. Doctors may measure the left ventricular wall thickness, and analyze left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output to assess the heart's functionality. They will also look for signs of hyperkinesis, hypokinesis, akinesis, and dyskinesis, which represent varying levels of heart wall contractions. Valves should be observed to ensure proper opening and closing for blood flow, while structural problems and heart defects should also be identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.  I am facing a new situation today: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the details of the new situation, patient A, a male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, who is a male without any of these illnesses. Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs due to the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. This extra genetic material interferes with male sexual development and affects the normal functioning of the testicles. As a result, individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have reduced levels of testosterone, which is the primary male sex hormone responsible for the development of male reproductive tissues, secondary sexual characteristics, and sexual function. In contrast, patient C is a male without Klinefelter's syndrome or any of the other mentioned genetic conditions. Therefore, it is expected that patient C would have normal testicular function and testosterone levels, which would be higher than the testosterone levels in patient A, who has Klinefelter's syndrome. In conclusion, patient A, the male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, a male without any of these illnesses."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the building that an explorer found a well preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation.\\"?, using the article: In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

During their exploration, they documented their findings, including the locations and styles of the great houses in Chaco Canyon, and specifically made note of the impressive masonry work at Chetro Ketl.

How Frida Kahlo's bright, beautiful garden inspired her In 1953 Frida Kahlo was preparing for an exhibition, drawing invitations on rose-pink pieces of card from her sick bed. It was an exciting moment for the 46-year-old artist, who had painted almost every day since a trolley-car accident had put an end to her medical studies two months after her 18th birthday, and left her bedridden for two years. But despite her resilience – she had already survived more than 30 operations on her spine and pelvis – her husband, the muralist Diego Rivera, was worried that she would not be well enough to attend. At the last moment he organised for her to be transported to the gallery in her four-poster canopy bed. From its cushions, and wearing one of her typically resplendent traditional Tehuana dresses, she held court, elated by the turn-out. To one journalist she said, “I am broken. But I am happy to be alive as long as I can paint.” Kahlo died the following year, after months in hospital that left her in a drugged stupor. Her last request when she came home was that she be moved to a room with a better view; she wanted to see her garden. Now a new book, Frida Kahlo’s Garden, which accompanies an exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden, shows how Kahlo’s love of the plants and trees that grew there came to energise her life and art. In many respects, the Casa Azul, or Blue House, in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City, where Kahlo lived for most of her life, and its garden can be counted as one of her artworks. Bought by her father in 1904 – three years before she was born – it came to her in 1939, when Rivera took over the mortgage. Over the years she and Rivera renovated, expanded and re-envisioned both the house and garden to express their wide-ranging tastes and their commitment to the idea of Mexico. Kahlo in particular treasured plants and used her affinity for colour to assemble pots and plant beds, which she embellished with a roster of sculptures and ancient stones. Photographs from the time show every wall, railing and column bursting with climbing vegetation, and plants in every architectural niche. The garden was a place of both comfort and inspiration for Kahlo; an immersive world where she could think about her work or entertain friends. Of the photographs we have of Kahlo with her lover Leon Trotsky, the Russian revolutionary who spent his exile in Mexico, several picture the two in the garden. And when she took up teaching, she used it as an open-air classroom for her students, nicknamed “Los Fridos” for their disciple-like devotion. Inside the house, Kahlo took to creating compositions of fruits and flowers for Rivera. On a big pine table in her sunny dining room she would arrange varying combinations of marigolds, blue and white irises, dahlias, calla lilies and violets. • The secret diary of Frida Kahlo Kahlo’s penchant for collecting is well known. Throughout her life she amassed tens of thousands of objects, including porcelain tea sets, papier-mâché religious figures, rustic cooking vessels and hundreds of the devotional paintings on tin known as ex-votos. But she also had a fondness for books, and often pressed flowers within their pages. The exhibition contains her copy of Walt Whitman’s poetic masterpiece Leaves of Grass, complete with tiny bouquets of dried leaves and petals that have lain undisturbed for years. And although the majority of her books relate to art and literature, slotted among them are copies of botanical field guides, books on Mexican medicinal plants and even a copy of an illustrated herbal handbook dating from 1552, which provides first-hand descriptions of the plants used by the Aztecs; plants from its pages are well represented in Kahlo’s art. In Kahlo’s time there was a great movement around the world to learn about Mexico. Even though the country had consummated independence from Spain in 1821 and endured the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917), when resentment against U.S. business interests had bubbled to the surface, it was still struggling to shape an identity. Art, architecture and day-to-day life were still overshadowed by European influence. Kahlo was very taken with the nationalistic cause. She altered her stated year of birth from 1907 to 1910, to coincide with the year the revolution began, and fought to maintain the presence of indigenous art and ideals in her work and in her home. She and Rivera built an Aztec-style pyramid in their garden, and used its terraced walls to display ancient artefacts. They rid the house of its neo-classical, European elements and painted the walls bright blue, using a traditional Mexican pigment. The original garden emulated the 19th-century European taste for ferns and palms. To these Kahlo added native plants such as agave, cactus and prickly pear, which grew alongside orange and apricot trees, quince and pomegranate. Many of these plants found their way on to her body – she almost always wore flowers threaded through her hair – and into her paintings. The garden of her childhood features in My Grandparents, My Parents, and I (1936), and in her Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) she is surrounded by a wall of vegetation that threatens to overwhelm her. These elephant ear plants can still be seen growing in the Casa Azul today. Her love of flowers, fruits and vegetables is most vividly expressed in her still-life paintings. She liked to use native fruits and flowers as a means of highlighting her Mexican heritage and nationality. “Mexican intellectuals were not just rediscovering native traditions and rituals, they were also discovering the Mexican natural world again, and the plant world particularly,” Adriana Zavala, the exhibition curator and author of the book, says. Kahlo would have been very familiar with the Dutch and Spanish still-life tradition, examples of which would have come over with the conquistadors. A painting of magnolia blooms is one of her most beautiful interpretations of this genre. In all likelihood, she used the magnolia that still grows in her courtyard as her model. But her decision to paint it went much deeper. The flower appealed to her because its unopened buds resemble a heart – one of her lovers, the Spanish artist Josep Bartolí, recalled Kahlo saying, “Fruits are like flowers – they speak to us in provocative language and teach us things that are hidden.” Kahlo was fascinated by symbols and myths, and often her depictions of plants are emblematic. Still Life (for Samuel Fastlicht) (1951), for example (Fastlicht was her dentist – she formed strong attachments to the doctors who attended her), is full of species that produce both male and female flowers on a single plant. These kinds of pairings – men and women, sun and moon, life and death – appear often in her paintings, but their meaning is never quite clear. “Kahlo had a very witty sense of humour,” Zavala says. “So a painting of mangos and cantaloupes can be in dialogue with the still-life tradition, but the way she parts the fruits gives them an almost malevolent or sexual quality. Sometimes they may relate to her sense of her mortality, but I don’t think her works are ever entirely biographical, or ever entirely malevolent or entirely celebratory. There’s always a contradiction or a balancing.” The Mexico City Kahlo grew up in was blessed with beautiful public gardens. Her neighbourhood of Coyoacán was known for its leafy squares and parks. It was also a hot spot for horticulture, particularly a large tree nursery known as the Viveros de Coyoacán. About a mile from her home was a famous sanatorium, where one of Mexico’s leading surgeons, Dr Aureliano Urrutia, turned the grounds into a private garden dedicated to health and history. And later she and Rivera would often visit the so-called “floating gardens” of the Aztecs, south of Mexico City, where tourists and locals rode large, flat-bottomed boats through a series of shallow lakes and canals that ran through the thick vegetation like lace. • Rich people shouldn't perv over Frida Kahlo's exquisite love letters One cannot help but imagine Kahlo painting outside, listening to the sounds of the parakeets and her pet monkeys. But this was not the case. “She wasn’t really a spontaneous, plein-air artist,” Zavala says. “She was incredibly meticulous, starting in an upper corner and slowly working her way down and across with a very fine paintbrush. But I absolutely believe that her garden sustained her. It’s why she transformed it. I think of it as an environment that nurtured her creativity.” “Frida Kahlo’s Garden” (Prestel, £22.50), by Adriana Zavala, is available from the Telegraph Bookshop for £19.99 plus £1.95 p&p What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Frida Kahlo was a famous artist who loved bright and beautiful things, especially her garden at her blue house in Mexico City. Her garden was filled with many colorful plants, flowers, and trees. This garden was very special to her and it inspired a lot of her paintings. She liked to put the plants and flowers in her artwork to show her love for her Mexican heritage. Her garden made her very happy and helped her create her beautiful paintings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a question that has the following answer:  At a strip club.  for the following movie plot:  Liz is a Los Angeles street prostitute. The audience first sees her attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passerby gives her his handkerchief and offers to take her to a hospital. She refuses, makes up a boyfriend story and asks for some money. She sends him the money back with a thank you note and a new handkerchief. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake. Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy. After the movie, Liz talks to the audience about her son, whom she clearly loves, though he's now in foster care. She finally gets a customer and services him. He has a heart... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie, where does Liz stop for a drink to escape her pimp, Blake, and share the story of her past, including her abusive marriage, her shift to sex work, and meeting Blake?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: \\"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as \\"[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\\" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became \\"insufferable – classically conceited – the world revolved around him\\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had \\"little understanding of polite society\\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \\"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother.

Answer the following question: -  The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is the occurrence of an earthquake. The seismic waves generated by the release of energy from the crumbling rocks and movement along the cracks, or fault lines, propagate through the Earth's crust. These waves can cause the ground to shake, resulting in the phenomenon we know as an earthquake. When the seismic waves reach the Earth's surface, they can cause significant damage to natural landscapes, human infrastructures, and even alter the environment in the vicinity of the fault line. The intensity of the shaking and the resulting damage can vary greatly depending on factors such as the amount of built-up stress released, the depth at which the cracks have formed and the movement occurred, the type of rocks and soil present in the area, and the population density in the region affected by the earthquake. In some instances, secondary hazards can also arise from earthquakes. For example, the shaking can trigger landslides and soil liquefaction, which can lead to further destruction of infrastructure and loss of life. Moreover, if the faults are located underwater or near a coastline, the movement of the Earth's crust could generate tsunamis, which are massive ocean waves that can cause widespread devastation upon reaching the shore. After an earthquake occurs, rescue and recovery efforts usually follow. These efforts may involve searching for and rescuing trapped individuals, providing medical assistance to the injured, assessing and repairing damaged infrastructures, and implementing rebuilding or relocation plans. Scientists and seismologists also continue to analyze the geological data from the earthquake to understand the processes that led to the event and develop methods to mitigate the impacts of future seismic activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  Answer this question please: In which stage the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase, stage A or stage B? A:","output":"In stage A, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase. This is because, during stage A, Rob keeps the gas at room temperature (300 K), which means there is no change in temperature, and thus no change in the kinetic energy of the gas molecules.

News article: For our latest mission, we brought the movie Ghostbusters to life in the reading room of The New York Public Library at 42 Street. The 1984 movie begins with a scene in the very same room, so we figured it was time for the Ghostbusters to make an encore appearance. Enjoy the video first and then go behind-the-scenes with the photos and report below.            Agents Hines, Purnell, Lathan, and Scordelis      The New York Public Library approached us about a month ago and asked if we would want to stage an Improv Everywhere mission on their property. The library is facing serious budget cuts, and they thought having us do something awesome there might serve to remind people of how great the NYPL is. We couldn’t say no to the opportunity to do something in their gorgeous, 100 year-old Rose Main Reading Room.      It actually wasn’t the first time we staged something on the NYPL grounds. Back in 2002, we held a ridiculous protest claiming to be a group called Writers Against Piracy . That mission was, of course, unauthorized. It was nice to get invited by the library this time around and to have their permission to set up our cameras. When brainstorming ideas for the mission, I immediately thought of Ghostbusters. The NYPL is heavily featured in the beginning of the movie, opening with a crane shot of the lion statue outside and cutting to the reading room. The thought of bringing the Ghostbusters back to the library 25 years later cracked me up.            Agent Lathan and his binocular glasses            Agent Purnell puts on his fake mustache            Showing the ghosts a map of the reading room      We met on the steps out front and got organized. Agent Adams came up with a plan to spread our team of six camera people discreetly around the room. Most of our operators used DSLR cameras, which allowed them to blend in perfectly with the constant stream of tourists taking photos of the historic room. I went over all of the blocking and timing with the actors. They then headed inside to a staging area and got into costume.      Agent Rodgers was the first ghost to enter. He grabbed a book off of a shelf on the way in and started heading for a seat. He was quickly stopped by a security guard, who had no idea what was going on.      Guard: Sir, what are you doing?      Rodgers: Um… haunting the library.      The guard allowed him to take a seat, and then went over to the information desk to laugh about it with another employee.            Rodgers takes his seat. Notice the girl in pink’s reaction (behind the girl in white)      The first ghost got some nice reactions from the folks he sat by, but they eventually went back to working when it became clear the ghost was just going to sit and read a book. That is, until ghost number two entered.            Agent Walker enters as the second ghost      (note the same guard reacting in the background)            Ghost working in the middle of the crowd            Closeup of the ghost’s computer screen      After about five minutes, the final ghost made his entrance. He walked down the aisle and headed over to the dictionary stand.            Agent Vernon      With three ghosts spread out in the reading room, who you gonna call?            Ghostbusters surveying the room            Tourists and library patrons take notice (and photos!) of the Ghostbusters            The first ghost reads, unaware of the danger he’s in      As soon as the Ghostbusters spotted the ghosts, Agent Lathan shouted, “Get ’em!”            The ghost leaps to his feet      All three ghosts leapt up and immediately started running around and making ghost noises.            Agent Hines finds the computer-using ghost      While the ghost-phase of the mission was pretty low-key, as soon as the chase started the room came alive. The room full of library patrons and tourists all started laughing, smiling, and frantically getting out their cameras and camera phones.      It was cool to see tables full of people taking off their headphones and laughing with each other.            Agent Scordelis follows a ghost out the door      The whole chase lasted less than a minute, as we didn’t want to be too disruptive to the people trying to get their work done. The Ghostbusters weren’t able to get their hands on the ghosts and ended up following them out of the reading room. After they left, the room broke out in applause.      The Ghostbusters chase wasn’t quite over yet. They followed the ghosts down the stairs and out the front door of the building!            The chase continues down Fifth Avenue      The Ghostbusters rounded the corner onto 42nd Street and disappeared out of view in pursuit of the ghosts. My guess is that they were successful, as the Ghostbusters were spotted later in the day in good spirits posing for a photo with a young fan.      Mission Accomplished.

Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2010.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor.

There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system.

Answer the following question: Process:  - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water gets into cracks in the rocks happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER erosion of rocks.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The proposed perturbation hypothesis states that if more water gets into cracks in rocks, it will lead to more or faster erosion of rocks. To evaluate the potential effects of this perturbation, let's consider each step involved in the erosion process and how increased water infiltration might impact them: Step 1: When water freezes, it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space. - If more water gets into cracks, there will be a greater volume of water that will expand upon freezing. This would mean that the force exerted on the walls of the cracks will be greater due to the increased volume of expanding ice. Step 2: As water expands, it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it. - With the increased volume of water in the cracks and, therefore, greater pressure on the rock walls, the likelihood of the rock splitting or breaking apart becomes higher. Step 3: The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack. - As more water occupies and expands within the crack, the walls of the crack will be pushed farther apart, leading to a more significant widening and deepening of the crack. Step 4: Clay expands when wet, like ice does. - If more water is entering the cracks, then more clay particles may be exposed to this water, leading to increased expansion and destabilization of the rock structure. Step 5: This causes the rock to break apart. - With more water infiltrating and expanding within the cracks, combined with expanding clay particles, the rock is more likely to break apart due to increased pressure and instability. Step 6: Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock. - These plants may benefit from the increased availability of water in the cracks, enabling them to grow more quickly and spread their roots further into the rock. Step 7: When they do this, their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks. - The faster growth of plants like mosses and lichens due to increased water availability can lead to more roots penetrating the rock, further contributing to the erosion process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a significant effect on the rock erosion process. More water getting into the cracks of rocks leads to increased pressure, clay expansion, and plant growth, all of which contribute to faster and more extensive erosion of rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  and the situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini.

Brian, a seasoned artist in the sand sculpting community, has dedicated years to honing his craft, allowing him to express his passion for the natural world through his ephemeral art form. As the camera zooms in on his work, viewers are astounded by the lifelike accuracy and unique personality he instills in every animal he creates, from the majestic lions and mighty elephants to the playful dolphins and delicate butterflies. The news anchor, visibly impressed, comments on the captivating and transient beauty of sand art, highlighting the challenge of crafting such detailed work on a medium that is, by nature, constantly shifting and susceptible to the elements.  As the segment draws to a close, Brian completes his latest sand masterpiece - a breathtaking family of meerkats, each with its own distinct features and expressions, standing watch on an expertly rendered mound. The sun casts a golden glow on the scene, creating a magical, otherworldly atmosphere that seems to capture the essence of the sand sculpting contest itself. The viewers can't help but marvel at the talent and dedication of the artists who pour their hearts and souls into concocting these art pieces, only for them to disappear, reclaimed by the sands from which they emerged. Yet, therein lies the beauty and allure of sand sculpting - it transcends the desire for permanence and embraces the fleeting, impermanent nature of life itself. With a final lingering look at the meerkat family, the camera transitions back to the news anchor, who wraps up the segment with an air of awe and appreciation, leaving both the viewers at home and those present on the beach struck by the notion that sometimes, it is the most ephemeral joys in life that create the most lasting memories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) .  - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered.  - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp).  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini.  - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.  - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.  - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines.  - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.  - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.  - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.  - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'cebidae'. A:","output":"The 'parent taxon' of 'Cebidae' is the 'Platyrrhini' according to the information given.

And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Question: \\"How does the Iranian President speak to the Western media?\\" Response: \\"He makes provocative statements and mercurial rants\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph.

Known for his illustrious career on the field, the ex-Manchester United star has become the subject of a legal battle that has captured the nation's attention. The events leading up to this trial began when authorities uncovered certain discrepancies in Cantona's business and financial dealings. As new evidence emerged, it became clear that the case was of a serious nature, prompting the French judiciary to take action and bring Cantona to court. The trial has attracted extensive media coverage both nationally and internationally, as Cantona's fans and sports enthusiasts seek to understand the events that led to their beloved footballer's entanglement in legal complications. Some have expressed shock and disappointment at the allegations circling around the football icon, while others stand firm in their support of Cantona. The prosecution will aim to present a strong case against Cantona, providing evidence that could potentially tarnish the legacy of one of France's most celebrated sportsmen. Meanwhile, Cantona's defense team is expected to contest the accusations with an equally robust argument, in an attempt to ensure that their client's reputation remains as unblemished as possible. As the trial unfolds, the French public is left to grapple with the rather unsettling notion that their former football hero may indeed face significant consequences if found guilty.

Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

Western powers are now becoming increasingly concerned that so-called Islamic State (IS) has built a presence in the North African state and the US has responded by launching air strikes on the militant group. Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom. During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates. There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis. This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country. Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in Libya IS had taken control of an \\"enclave\\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean. However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city. Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq. IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya. Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities. Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic State How IS's Libya foothold threatens UK The Libyans gaining ground on IS The US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive. Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB). Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised. Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow. He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \\"the mess\\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis. Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli. The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee. The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country. The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned. Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US. Has Libya pulled back from the brink? They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law. My search for Gaddafi's golden gun East and central: West: Guide to Libya's militias Profile: Khalifa Haftar Rogue general divides Libyans Oil production almost ground to a halt for more than two years but has recovered a little in recent months. This happened after a siege was lifted by LNA forces when they took over the main oil fields in central Libya and expelled a rival armed group led by Ibrahim Jathran. Banks are still strapped for cash, however, and there is little foreign currency available officially. The black market exchange rate has sky-rocketed in recent months, and food prices have risen.  Hospitals are in short supply of medicine. An estimated 400,000 Libyans are also internally displaced. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the complex and unstable situation in Libya, where multiple governments, armed militias, and extremist groups are vying for power. The Western powers, particularly the United States, have been increasingly concerned about the growing presence of the Islamic State (IS) in North Africa. The instability in Libya, which has been ongoing since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011, has led to rival parliaments and governments, a financial crisis, and an abundance of weapons from the former regime's arsenal. The turmoil has created an ideal environment for IS to gain a foothold in the country, with the group establishing an \\"enclave\\" in and around Sirte. However, pro-government forces backed by the West have since retaken the city. The United States has carried out at least four known airstrikes in Libya since 2015, and the UK and France have special forces operating in the country, though the nature and extent of these operations remain largely secretive. There are various factions and militias fighting for control in Libya, with some seeking power along ideological, regional, ethnic, or local lines. This has made it challenging for any single group to gain control and establish a unified government. Former US President Barack Obama acknowledged that one of his biggest mistakes during his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Gaddafi's removal from power. The ongoing crisis in Libya has had severe consequences for the country's economy and infrastructure, with oil production significantly reduced, hospitals facing medicine shortages, and an estimated 400,000 Libyans internally displaced."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman Loera, a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means \\"Shorty,\\" is the most wanted man in Mexico. He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a 5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. \\"No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,\\" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said.  See who the key players are ». The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. \\"It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,\\" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. \\"Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,\\" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in 8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at 3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned 1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year.  Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop ». The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. \\"From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top.\\" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime \\"Hummer\\" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as \\"El Lazco,\\" or \\"The Executioner.\\" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' \\"desperate\\" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. \\"The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas.\\" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as \\"The King of the Skies\\" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez  as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. \\"Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,\\" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: \\"That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States.\\" CNN's Eliott C.

Romney still holds wide lead in New Hampshire: poll LITTLETON, New Hampshire | Sat Oct 8, 2011 11:57am EDT LITTLETON, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney holds a wide lead in the early primary state of New Hampshire, with former pizza executive Herman Cain a distant second place, a poll showed. Romney, a former governor from neighboring Massachusetts, leads the Republican field with 37 percent support in the poll released late on Friday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center/WMUR. Cain trails with 12 percent, followed by Texas congressman Ron Paul at 9 percent and former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman at 8 percent. \\"Romney is solid here and has the highest favorability ratings, and he's had those for two years,\\" said Andrew Smith, director of the polling group. \\"It's kind of an obstacle course for the front-runner, but as long as they make it through those obstacles they win.\\" In the polling group's last poll in July, Romney had 35 percent support. New Hampshire's primary, traditionally the first in the nation, could be held in early January or even December following moves by other states to bring forward their primaries or caucuses. New Hampshire's mostly moderate Republicans had little love for Tea Party favorites Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. Texas Governor Perry drew just 4 percent, tied with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Minnesota congresswoman Bachmann lagged at just 2 percent. The poll of 345 likely Republican primary voters was conducted between September 26 and October 6, and had a margin of error of 5.3 percentage points. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has not entered the race, was at 8 percent. Three percent backed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who said on October 5 that she would not run. A range of data showed Romney's strength in the state, where he owns a vacation home: 65 percent of those polled said they expect Romney to win the Republican nomination, and 52 percent said he was the Republican with the best chance to beat President Barack Obama in the November 2012 general election. Cain is the latest Republican to gain momentum and appear as a potential alternative to Romney. Perry, Bachmann and Gingrich all briefly emerged as potential challengers to Romney in New Hampshire before fading. \\"There have been a number of people who have gotten that bounce over 10 percent but haven't been able to consolidate support,\\" Smith said. Republican candidates will debate in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Tuesday.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Study: Politicians can change hearts and minds simply by stating their views Let's get back to basics for a minute: How does democracy work? The classic understanding is that citizens form opinions on various issues, and then elect representatives who share those opinions. Moreover, when politicians deviate from the will of their constituents while in office, voters can simply vote them out of office in favor of a candidate more closely aligned with their views. Government by the people, for the people, and reflecting the will of the people. As you might imagine, political scientists' understanding of this relationship between public opinion and politician behavior has grown more complicated in recent decades. Some argue that politicians shape public opinion by showing that their positions are consistent with voters' underlying values. Other research suggests that voters often support policies simply because their favorite political leaders do. Now, a paper by political scientists at UC Berkeley and the Washington University in St. Louis reports on the results of a novel real-world experiment. The study finds that contrary to classic theories of democracy, voters did not view politicians more negatively when the politicians took positions voters opposed. Not only that, voters often adopted these positions themselves, even when politicians offered little or no justification for them. These results \\"leave open the possibility that politicians think the constraints public opinion places on them are stronger than they are,\\" the authors conclude, and they suggest that \\"politicians can enjoy broad latitude to shape public opinion.\\" Here's how the experiment worked: The researchers recruited 7 Democratic state lawmakers in an unnamed midwestern state. In the spring of 2014, the researchers surveyed registered voters in the lawmakers' districts to determine which issue positions had the least public support. The issues included everything from immigration to taxation to marijuana policy. The legislators then sent official letters to registered voters of both political parties in their respective districts. The letters were targeted toward voters who had expressed opinions that were at odds with the lawmakers' own stances. The voters were randomly assigned to receive one of three letters. From the report: (i) a “control” letter where the legislator introduced themselves, described the services their office could conduct for constituents, and described a few locally oriented achievements (e.g., designating a building downtown a historic place), (ii) a “direct” policy letter that added language in which the legislators took a position the recipient had not agreed with previously and made only the briefest justification for their position, and (iii) an “arguments” policy letter that added extensive arguments for this position designed to appeal to citizens’ values Finally, they performed a follow-up survey of the constituents to see how their opinions of both the issues and the politicians had changed, if at all. As it turns out, the positions staked out by the legislators had a significant effect on their constituents views: \\"The constituents who were sent letters with the legislators’ positions were about 5 percentage points less likely to disagree with the legislator and about 5 percentage points more likely to agree with the legislator.\\" More surprisingly, it didn't make a difference whether politicians provided good arguments for their positions or not: \\"We find little evidence that legislators’ arguments were responsible for their persuasive impact. Legislators appeared able to move constituents’ opinions by stating their own positions with minimal justification; adding additional arguments did not make them more persuasive.\\" Finally, lawmaker favorability was completely unaffected by knowledge of their policy stances. \\"We find no evidence that legislators suffered electoral costs by taking positions constituents disagreed with; citizens who received letters from their legislators taking positions they had disagreed with previously evaluated their legislators no less favorably.\\" \\"We were surprised by the fact that there wasn't any pushback from the constituents in terms of disapproval,\\" co-author Dan Butler said in an interview. Since voters tend to not know a lot about their state legislators, the expectation was that finding out about a disagreement would lead voters to perceive them more negatively. \\"It seems like a lot of people are predisposed to trust their legislators, even on policies we think of as inspiring a lot of controversy,\\" co-author David Broockman said. \\"Most legislators really do care about advancing the public interest. What's exciting here, and the reason why the lawmakers were interested in participating in the study, is that it gives them insight into whether they can help advance those causes further.\\" We tend to think of voters' political views as fixed and immobile, particularly in the current environment of polarization and partisanship. But these results suggest that politicians do have some latitude to sway voters' views. Moreover, it doesn't seem likely that voters changed their views due to raw political tribalism. The letters from the lawmakers didn't include information on party affiliation at all. \\"What this points toward is a world where politicians actually have special responsibility to inform the public because they are afforded special trust,\\" Broockman said. \\"The costs associated with doing the right thing according to their values are not as significant as they think.\\" That \\"special responsibility to inform\\" is a key point. The optimistic takeaway here is that legislators with sincerely-held beliefs have some power to bring constituents over to their side. But the flipside is that demagoguery may be more politically potent than previously assumed. For instance, Sarah Palin sold many voters on the false notion of Obamacare \\"death panels\\" as far back as 2009. Five years later, 34 percent of voters still believe in them.

Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses initial excitement for the product but encounters multiple disappointments throughout their experience, ultimately leading them to return the product and opt for more effective alternatives.  The disappointment starts with the lack of information provided on the box regarding the recommended stage of pregnancy for using the product, which is later found in the instruction booklet. This discrepancy leads to a delay in the reviewer's ability to use the device and contributes to the overall negative impression of the product. Furthermore, the reviewer continues to experience ongoing difficulties while attempting to use the product, even when following the provided guidelines. Despite being 8 months pregnant and having tried various positioning methods to detect the baby's heartbeat, the reviewer is only able to pick up their own heartbeat and stomach noises. This inability to fulfill its primary function leaves the reviewer feeling dissatisfied and frustrated. In addition to these crucial issues, the product's music feature is also criticized as being unnecessary and overpriced. The reviewer points out that the baby does not require the microphone to hear music, and they have found a more cost-effective solution by using their regular stereo system. This further emphasizes the product's shortcomings and reinforces the reviewer's decision to return it. In conclusion, the review portrays the product in an unfavorable light due to a series of disappointments faced by the reviewer. These negative experiences encompass confusing product packaging, inadequacy in performing its main function, and the perceived redundancy of supplementary features. The overall verdict is that the product is not worth the investment, and the money could be better spent on alternative solutions that meet the user's needs more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nelson was the pitcher.. (2). Ryan was the pitcher..","output":"Nelson used the new baseballs at the field to throw at Ryan because Nelson was the pitcher. Nelson, a tall, lanky young man with a passion for baseball, had recently joined a local baseball team, the Thunderbolts. As a naturally gifted athlete, he quickly earned the position of the team's pitcher, showcasing exceptional skills and precision. He dedicated countless hours to honing his pitching technique and mastering various pitches to ensure that he could fulfill his role to the best of his ability. In particular, he focused on perfecting his fastball, curveball, and slider. As the summer sun shone down on the field, casting a warm glow over the neatly manicured green grass, Nelson enthusiastically took advantage of the new baseballs provided by the team's management. Each shiny, white leather ball seemed to hold the promise of potential, waiting to be hurled across the field in a display of Nelson's talent. Standing a few meters away from Nelson in the batter's box was Ryan. Ryan was a formidable opponent – the Thunderbolts' star batter and a highly skilled player in his own right. With his chiseled jaw, broad shoulders, and a steely determination in his eyes, he exuded confidence and prowess in every aspect of the game. His unwavering focus on improving his swing and hand-eye coordination made him a force to be reckoned with on the field. Nelson and Ryan formed an intriguing duo – the pitcher and the batter – locked in a fierce, yet symbiotic competition. As Nelson prepared to throw each new baseball across the field, their shared goal was not only to outperform each other but also to constantly challenge and encourage each other to reach new heights. With a mighty windup, Nelson unleashed a flurry of lightning-fast pitches, each calculated to test the limits of Ryan's batting skills. The balls whizzed through the air, leaving only a faint white trail in their wake as Ryan swung his bat with furious determination, trying to make contact. The steel of the bat cut through the air, sometimes with a satisfying crack as it connected solidly with a ball, and other times leaving a lingering, anticipatory silence. Nelson continuously adjusted the speed, angle, and spin of his pitches, allowing Ryan to adapt to each new challenge presented to him. This unique and evolving dynamic between the pitcher and the batter showcased the intricate dance that lies at the heart of the game of baseball. It wasn't just a game – It was a testament to the hard work, discipline, and determination of two athletes who were searching for greatness on the field. In this snapshot of time, Nelson and Ryan's respective roles as pitcher and batter presented a perfect tableau of the game they both loved and shared. Each new baseball thrown at the field was a testament to their dedication to the sport – a dedication that would lead them to push the boundaries of their abilities and continue the enduring legacy of baseball.

Both Funimation and Crunchyroll simulcast the series on their respective websites, and Funimation began releasing the series on North American home video in 2014. The anime has been licensed in the UK by Manga Entertainment. Madman Entertainment acquired the show for distribution in Australia and New Zealand. The final episode was also aired in Japanese theaters. The anime had some production issues with needing more animators with Wit Studios' character designer, Kyoji Asano tweeting and looking for active animators to work on the anime. An OVA version of the \`\`Ilse's Notebook'' special chapter from tankōbon volume 5 was originally scheduled to be released on August 9, 2013, bundled with the volume 11 limited edition, but was postponed and included with a limited edition of volume 12, released on December 9, 2013, instead.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What territories were not conquered by the Spanish?  Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.

BBC Wales revealed five Welsh Tory MPs have urged George Osborne to reverse the announcement, made in November. They said the policy change was \\"disrespectful\\" and breached the Conservatives' 2015 election manifesto. But Cardiff North MP Craig Williams said there was no \\"big row\\" and AMs needed \\"some fiscal responsibility\\". Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said devolving income tax powers would mean \\"better government for Wales\\". Some of the MPs opposed to the move hope to raise the issue at a meeting with Mr Osborne on Wednesday. The five - Byron Davies, Chris Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones - have written to him on the issue \\"This is a line in the sand for many of us,\\" one MP said. Another said it would be \\"very embarrassing\\" for the Conservative UK government if almost half of the party's 11 Welsh MPs were to vote against the measure. The letter said that during the general election campaign Tory candidates \\"were able to reassure people that the assembly would not get tax raising powers without the consent of the people of Wales\\". \\"To drop the commitment to a referendum would put us in breach of a clear manifesto commitment,\\" it continued. The Welsh Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election made reference to an \\"expectation that the Welsh government will hold a referendum on income tax powers\\". The five MPs said people in Wales should not be \\"treated differently in this respect from the people of Scotland, who did have a separate vote on the issue of tax varying powers\\" in the 1997 referendum on devolution. \\"We frankly feel that to impose such powers without a referendum would be disrespectful to the Welsh people,\\" they added. Mr Williams responded: \\"You're going to have cases with business rates being devolved to areas like Manchester, where Manchester City Council might have more fiscal responsibility than the entire Welsh nation,\\" Mr Williams said. \\"It's about time they [the assembly] had some responsibility for income of money as well as spending it on their pet projects.\\" In December, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he thought public opinion was \\"fluid\\" on the matter, but there were \\"very, very strong reasons for why we need to press ahead\\" for Wales and the Welsh economy to get stronger. Splits within the Welsh Conservative group in Cardiff Bay on the devolution of income tax led to the party's leader Andrew RT Davies sacking four members of his front bench team in February 2014. They were re-instated in the summer. Mr Davies said he would use income tax powers to take 5p off the higher rate and 1p off the basic rate in Wales if he was first minister. A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: \\"The position of the UK government and chancellor is very clear on this matter and we have long called for the Welsh government to be more accountable for the money it raises and spends.\\" A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: \\"This latest development shows the Tories' true colours when it comes to empowering Wales. \\"They support transferring substantial powers, including policing, to English cities without a referendum and yet are trying to block Wales having powers over small proportion of income tax which could be of benefit to the Welsh economy.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article reports that five Welsh Conservative MPs have urged George Osborne to reverse an announcement made in November about devolving income tax powers to Wales.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Christopher Knight was only 20 years old when he walked away from society, not to be seen again for more than a quarter of a century. He had been working for less than a year installing home and vehicle alarm systems near Boston, Massachusetts, when abruptly, without giving notice to his boss, he quit his job. He never even returned his tools. He cashed his final pay cheque and left town.      Knight did not tell anyone where he was going. “I had no one to tell,” he says. “I didn’t have any friends. I had no interest in my co-workers.” He drove down the east coast of America, eating fast food and staying in cheap motels – “the cheapest I could find”. He travelled for days, alone, until he found himself deep into Florida, sticking mostly to major roads, watching the world go by.      Eventually, he turned around and headed north. He listened to the radio. Ronald Reagan was president; the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had just occurred. Driving through Georgia and the Carolinas and Virginia, blessed with invincibility of youth, buzzed by “the pleasure of driving”, he sensed an idea growing into a realisation, then solidifying into resolve.      All his life, he had been comfortable being alone. Interacting with others was so often frustrating. Every meeting with another person seemed like a collision.      He drove north to Maine, where he had grown up. There aren’t many roads in the centre of the state, and he chose the one that went right by his family’s house. “I think it was just to have one last look around, to say goodbye,” he said. He didn’t stop. The last time he saw his family home was through the windscreen of his car.      He kept going, “up and up and up”. Soon he reached the shore of Moosehead Lake, the largest in Maine, and the point where the state begins to get truly remote. “I drove until I was nearly out of gas. I took a small road. Then a small road off that small road. Then a trail off that.” He went as far into the wilderness as his vehicle could take him.      Knight parked the car and tossed the keys on the centre console. He had a tent and a backpack but no compass, no map. Without knowing where he was going, with no particular place in mind, he stepped into the trees and walked away.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest A forest tree canopy in Rockport, Maine. Photograph: Mauricio Handler/Getty Images/National Geographic Magazines      Why would a 20-year-old man abruptly abandon the world? The act had elements of a suicide, except he didn’t kill himself. “To the rest of the world, I ceased to exist,” said Knight. Following his disappearance, Knight’s family must have suffered; they had no idea what had happened to him, and couldn’t completely accept the idea that he might be dead.      His final gesture, leaving his keys in the car, was particularly strange. Knight was raised with a keen appreciation of the value of money, and the car was the most expensive item he had ever purchased. Why not hold on to the keys as a safety net? What if he didn’t like camping out?      “The car was of no use to me. It had just about zero gas and I was miles and miles from any gas station,” he said. As far as anyone knows, the car is still there, half-swallowed by the forest. Knight said that he didn’t really know why he left. He had given the question plenty of thought but had never arrived at a specific answer. “It’s a mystery,” he declared.      There have been hermits – also known as recluses, monks, misanthropes, ascetics, anchorites, swamis – at all times in recorded history, across all cultures. But there are really only three general reasons why people leave the world.      Most do so for religious purposes, to forge a closer bond with a higher power. Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha all spent significant time alone before introducing a new religion to the world. In Hindu philosophy, everyone ideally matures into a kind of hermit, and today at least four million people live as wandering holy men in India, surviving off the charity of strangers, having renounced all familial and material attachments.      Other hermits opt out of civilisation because of a hatred of what the world has become – too much war, or environmental destruction, or crime, or consumerism. The first great literary work about solitude, the Tao Te Ching, was written in China in the sixth century BC by a hermit named Laozi, who was protesting the corrupt state of society. The Tao Te Ching says that it is only through retreat rather than pursuit, through inaction rather than action, that we acquire wisdom.      Christopher Knight: inside the Maine hermit's lair Read more      The final category includes those who wish to be alone for reasons of artistic freedom, scientific insight or deeper self-understanding. Henry David Thoreau went to Walden Pond in Massachusetts to journey within, to explore “the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being”. English historian Edward Gibbon said that “solitude was the school for genius”.      Knight fit into none of these categories – he did not follow any formal religion; he was not protesting modern society; he produced no artwork or philosophical treatise. He never took a photograph or wrote a sentence; not a single person knew where he was. His back was fully turned to the world. There was no clear reason for what he chose to do. Something he couldn’t quite pinpoint had tugged him away from the world with the persistence of gravity. He was one of the longest‑enduring solitaries in history, and among the most fervent as well. Christopher Knight was a true hermit.      “I can’t explain my actions,” he said. “I had no plans when I left, I wasn’t thinking of anything. I just did it.”      Knight’s goal was to get lost. Not just lost to the rest of the world but actually lost in the woods by himself. He carried only rudimentary camping supplies, a few articles of clothing and a little food. “I had what I had,” he said, “and nothing more.”      It is not easy to get truly lost. Anyone with basic outdoor skills generally knows which way they are heading. The sun burns west across the sky, and from there it is natural to set the other directions. Knight knew that he was heading south. He said that he didn’t make a conscious decision to do so. Instead, he felt pulled in that direction, like a homing pigeon. “There was no depth or substance to the idea. It was at the instinctual level. It’s instinct among animals to return to home territory, and my home ground, where I was born and raised, was that way.”      Maine is partitioned into a series of long north-south valleys, the geologic clawmark left by glaciers surging and retreating. Separating the valleys are strings of mountains, now weather-worn and bald-topped like old men. The valley floors at the time of year when Knight arrived were a summer soup of ponds and wetlands and bogs.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest A television found at Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images      “I kept largely to the ridges,” Knight said, “and sometimes crossed swamps going from one ridge to another.” He worked his way along crumbled slopes and muddy wetlands. “Soon I lost track of where I was. I didn’t care.” He would camp in one spot for a week or so, then head south yet again. “I kept going,” he said. “I was content in the choice I had made.”      Content except for one thing: food. Knight was hungry, and he really didn’t know how he would feed himself. His departure from the outside world was a confounding mix of incredible commitment and complete lack of forethought – not all that strange for a 20-year-old. It was as if he went camping for the weekend and then didn’t come home for a quarter of a century. He was an able hunter and angler, but he took neither a gun nor a rod with him. Still, he didn’t want to die, at least not then. Knight’s idea was to forage. The wilds of Maine are monumentally broad, though not generous. There are no fruit trees. Berries sometimes have a weekend-long season. Without hunting or trapping or fishing, a person is going to starve.      Knight worked his way south, eating very little, until paved roads appeared. He found a road-killed partridge, but did not possess a stove or a way to easily start a fire, so he ate it raw. Neither a tasty meal nor a hearty one, and a good way to get sick. He passed houses with gardens, but was raised with rigid morals and a great deal of pride. You make do on your own, always. No handouts or government assistance, ever. You know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the dividing line is usually clear.      But try not eating for 10 days – nearly everyone’s restraints will be eroded. Hunger is hard to ignore. “It took a while to overcome my scruples,” Knight said, but as soon as his principles began to fall away, he snapped off a few ears of corn from one garden, dug up some potatoes from another, and ate a couple of green vegetables.      Once, during his first weeks away, he spent the night in an unoccupied cabin. It was a miserable experience. “The stress of that, the sleepless worry about getting caught, programmed me not to do that again.” Knight never slept indoors after that, not once, no matter how cold or rainy the weather.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images      He continued moving south, picking through gardens, and eventually reached a region with a familiar distribution of trees, along with a diversity of birdcalls and a temperature range he felt accustomed to. It had been colder up north. Knight wasn’t sure precisely where he was, but he knew that it was home ground. It turned out that he was less than 30 miles, as the crow flies, from his childhood home.      In the early days, nearly everything Knight learned was through trial and error. He had been gifted with a good head for figuring out workable solutions to complicated problems. All his skills, from the rigging of the tarps that formed his shelter, to how to store drinking water, to walking through the forest without leaving tracks, went through multiple revisions and were never considered perfect. Tinkering with his systems was one of Knight’s hobbies.      Over the next few months, Knight tried living in several places in the area – including inside a dank hole in a riverbank – all without satisfaction. Finally, he stumbled upon a region of nasty, boulder-choked woods without so much as a game trail running through it; far too harsh for hikers. He liked it immediately. Then he discovered a cluster of boulders, one with a hidden opening that led to a tiny, wondrous clearing. “I knew at once it was ideal. So I settled in.”      Still, he remained hungry. Knight was beginning to realise that is almost impossible to live by yourself all the time. You need help. Hermits across history often ended up in deserts or mountains or woodlands – the sorts of places where it was extremely difficult to find or catch all your own food. To feed themselves, some of the Desert Fathers – third-century Christian Hermits from Egypt – wove reed baskets and sold them. In ancient China, hermits were shamans, herbalists and diviners. Later, a fad for hermits swept 18th-century England. It was believed that hermits radiated kindness and thoughtfulness, so advertisements were placed in newspapers for “ornamental hermits” who were lax in grooming and willing to sleep in caves on the country estates of the aristocracy. The job paid well and hundreds were hired, typically on seven-year contracts. Some of the hermits would even emerge at dinner parties and greet guests.      Knight, however, felt that anyone’s willing assistance tainted the whole enterprise. He wished to be unconditionally alone; an uncontacted tribe of one.      The cabins around the ponds in central Maine, Knight noted, had minimal security measures. Windows were often left open, even when the owners were away. The woods offered excellent cover, and with few permanent residents, the area would always be empty during the off-season. A summer camp with a big pantry was nearby. The easiest way to become a hunter-gatherer here was obvious.      And so Knight decided to steal.      To commit a thousand break-ins before getting caught, a world-class streak, requires precision and patience, daring and luck. It also demands a specific understanding of people. “I looked for patterns,” Knight said. “Everyone has patterns.”      He perched at the edge of the woods and meticulously observed the habits of the families with cabins along the ponds. He watched their quiet breakfasts and dinner parties, their visitors and vacancies, the cars moving up and down the road. Nothing Knight saw tempted him to return to his former life. His surveillance was clinical, informational, mathematical. He did not learn anyone’s name. All he sought was to understand migration patterns – when people went shopping, when a cabin was unoccupied. After that, he said, everything in his life became a matter of timing. The ideal time to steal was deep in the night, midweek, preferably when it was overcast, best in the rain. A heavy downpour was prime. People stayed out of the woods when it was wet.      Still, Knight did not walk on roads or trails, just in case, and he never launched a raid on a Friday or Saturday – days he knew had arrived from the obvious surge in lakeside noise.      For a while, he opted to go out when the moon was large, so he could use it as a light source. In later years, when he suspected the police had intensified their search for him, he switched to no moon at all. Knight liked to vary his methods. He didn’t want to develop any patterns of his own, though he did make it a habit to embark on a raid only when freshly shaved or with a neatly groomed beard, and wearing clean clothing, so as to reduce suspicion on the slight chance that he was spotted.      There were at least 100 cabins in Knight’s thieving repertoire. The ideal was a fully stocked place, with the family away until the weekend. He knew, in many cases, the precise number of steps required to reach a particular cabin, and once he selected a target, he bounded and weaved through the forest. Sometimes, if he was headed far or needed a load of propane or a replacement mattress it was easier to travel by canoe. Canoes are difficult to hide, and if you steal one, the owner will call the police. It was wiser to borrow, and there was a large selection around the lake, some up on sawhorses and seldom used.      Knight was capable of reaching homes anywhere along the largest pond near his hidden campsite. “I’d think nothing of paddling for hours, whatever needed to be done.” If the water was choppy, he would place a few rocks in the front of the boat to keep it stable. Typically, he stayed close to shore, cloaked against the trees, hiding in the silhouette of the land, though on a stormy night he would paddle across the middle, alone in the dark and lashed by the rain.      When he arrived at his chosen cabin, he would make sure there were no vehicles in the driveway, no sign of someone inside. Burglary is a dicey business, with a low margin for error. One mistake and the outside world would snatch him back. So he crouched in the dark and waited, sometimes for hours. “I enjoy being in the dark,” he said.      He never risked breaking into a home occupied year-round, and he always wore a watch so he could monitor the time.      Sometimes, cabins were left unlocked. Those were the easiest to enter, though soon other places became nearly as simple. Knight had keys to them, found during previous break-ins. He stashed each key on its respective property, typically under some nondescript rock. He created several dozen of these stashes and never forgot where one was.      He noticed when several cabins left out pens and paper, requesting a shopping list, and others offered him bags of supplies, hanging from a doorknob. But he was fearful of traps, or tricks, or initiating any sort of correspondence, even a grocery list. So he left everything untouched, and people stopped.      For the majority of his break-ins, Knight worked the lock on a window or door. He always carried his lock-breaking kit, a gym bag with a collection of screwdrivers and flat bars and files, all of which he had stolen, and could defeat all but the most fortified bolts with the perfect little jiggle of just the right tool. When he had finished stealing, he would often reseal the hasp on the window he had unlatched and exit through the front door, making sure the handle was set, if possible, to lock up behind himself. No need to leave the place vulnerable to thieves.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The bow of a canoe on Lang Pond in Maine’s Northern Forest. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo      As the local residents invested in security upgrades, Knight adapted. He knew about alarms from his one paying job, and he used this knowledge to continue stealing – sometimes disabling systems or removing memory cards from surveillance cameras. He evaded dozens of attempts to catch him, by both police officers and private citizens. The crime scenes he left behind were so clean that the authorities offered their begrudging respect. “The level of discipline he showed while he broke into houses,” said one police officer, “is beyond what any of us can remotely imagine – the legwork, the reconnaissance, the talent with locks, his ability to get in and out without being detected.”      A burglary report filed by another officer specifically noted the crime’s “unusual neatness”. The hermit, many officers felt, was a master thief. It was as if he were showing off, picking locks yet stealing little, playing a strange sort of game.      Knight said the moment he opened a lock and entered a home, he always felt a hot wave of shame. “Every time, I was very conscious that I was doing wrong. I took no pleasure in it, none at all.” Once inside a cabin, he moved purposefully, hitting the kitchen first before making a quick sweep of the house, looking for any useful items, or the batteries he always required. He never turned on a light. He used only a small torch attached to a metal chain he wore around his neck.      During a burglary, there wasn’t a moment’s ease. “My adrenaline was spiking, my heart rate was soaring. My blood pressure was high. I was always scared when stealing. Always. I wanted it over as quickly as possible.”      When Knight was finished with the inside of the cabin, he would habitually check the gas grill to see if the propane tank was full. If so, and there was an empty spare lying around, he would replace the full one with an empty, making the grill appear untouched.      Then he would load everything into a canoe, if he had borrowed one, and paddle to the shore closest to his camp to unload. He would return the canoe to the spot he had taken it from, sprinkle some pine needles on the boat to make it appear unused, then haul his loot up through the dense woods, between the rocks, to his home.      Each raid brought Knight enough supplies to last about two weeks, and as he settled once more into his room in the woods – “back in my safe place, success” – he experienced a deep sense of peace.      Knight said that he couldn’t accurately describe what it felt like to spend such an immense period of time alone. Silence does not translate into words. “It’s complicated,” he said. “Solitude bestows an increase in something valuable. I can’t dismiss that idea. Solitude increased my perception. But here’s the tricky thing: when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for. There was no need to define myself. I became irrelevant.”      The dividing line between himself and the forest, Knight said, seemed to dissolve. His isolation felt more like a communion. “My desires dropped away. I didn’t long for anything. I didn’t even have a name. To put it romantically, I was completely free.”      Virtually everyone who has tried to describe deep solitude has said something similar. “I am nothing; I see all,” wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lord Byron called it “the feeling infinite”. The American mystic Thomas Merton said that “the true solitary does not seek himself, but loses himself”.      For those who do not choose to be alone – like prisoners and hostages – a loss of one’s socially created identity can be terrifying, a plunge into madness. Psychologists call it “ontological insecurity”, losing your grip on who you are. Edward Abbey, in Desert Solitaire, a chronicle of two six‑month stints as a ranger in Utah’s Arches National Monument, said that being solitary for a long time “means risking everything human”. Knight, meanwhile, didn’t even keep a mirror in his camp. He was never once bored. He wasn’t sure, he said, that he even understood the concept of boredom. “I was never lonely,” Knight added. He was attuned to the completeness of his own presence rather than to the absence of others.      “If you like solitude,” he said, “you are never alone.”      Knight was finally arrested, after 27 years of complete isolation, while stealing food at a lakeside summer camp. He was charged with burglary and theft, and taken to the local jail. His arrest caused an enormous commotion – letters and visitors arrived at the jail, and approximately 500 journalists requested an interview. A documentary film team showed up.

Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Press Herald via Getty Images      Everyone wanted to know what the hermit would say. What insights had he gained while he was alone? What advice did he have for the rest of us? People have been approaching hermits with similar requests for thousands of years, eager to consult with someone whose life has been so radically different to their own.      Profound truths, or at least those that make sense of the seeming randomness of life, are difficult to find. Thoreau wrote that he had reduced his existence to its basic elements so that he could “live deep and suck out all the marrow of life”.      Knight did, eventually permit one journalist to meet him, and over the course of nine one-hour visits in the jail, the hermit shared his life story – about how he was able to survive, and what it felt like to live alone for so long.      And once, when he was in an especially introspective mood, Knight seemed willing, despite his typical aversion to dispensing wisdom, to share more of what he gleaned while alone. Was there, the journalist asked him, some grand insight revealed to him in the wild?      Knight sat quietly but he eventually arrived at a reply.      “Get enough sleep,” he said.      He set his jaw in a way that conveyed he wouldn’t be saying any more. This was what he’d learned. It was, without question, the truth.      This is an adapted extract of The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkel, published by Simon and Schuster      • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here ||||| I wanted to read this book as the Maine woods have been a part of my life and I was unfamiliar with this story until I saw this book. I realized from the start that at the core of this story was an important topic I already have been worrying about that I feel American society either is unaware of or is purposefully ignoring: the neuro-atypical person and the challenge of how they will live (not thriving but suffering) in modern America.            I found the book a page turner from the start. I did sneak to the Internet as I was dying to know more and found many videos online such as press conferences with the investigating local law enforcement and video of the now-disassembled camp site. The story was written in a way that was engaging and it moved at a pace that was just right. It's a short 201 pages and the personal details were provided in just nine hours of interviewing, limited by the \\"hermit's\\" choice to tell only so much and no more, keeping some things private, and sharing his opinions that are sometimes short and blunt (not pontificating).            This is the story of a man who walked into the Maine woods with a small number of items who chose to live in seclusion, robbing lakeside summer camps (vacation cabins) for food and basic supplies. With no military or survivalist training other than reading trade books such as the Foxfire series, he devised systems and carved a llife that allowed him to live for 27 years in the brutal Maine woods, sometimes in 20+ below zero winter weather. He only interacted with other people twice, once saying just \\"hi\\" to a hiker and once with hand movements and body language only. Knight was content and found peace in living that life until he was caught with the help of sophisticated surveillance equipment while robbing food from a nonprofit camp for disabled children (including kids on the Autism Spectrum).            While telling the story of Christopher Knight's life as a hermit, Finkel weaves in his research on the related topics of voluntary solitude versus loneliness, the brain and what scientific studies have told us about the human need for social connection, the role of hormones, and about various (supposed) disorders that our society has invented and given names to. To a layperson Knight seems to have Asperger's, but that's a diagnosis that now no longer exists, it's been renamed and grouped under the broader umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorder. From my own reading of the book Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnosis of Gifted Children and Adults by James Webb et al I wonder if Knight's IQ is one that is so high that other neuro-atypical elements also are present. In the book it was said that doctors refused to make a diagnosis of Asperger's because Knight was too high functioning in daily life to qualify for the diagnosis. The heartbreaking part of this story is that the suffering that Knight endured was due to square pegs not fitting in the round holes of modern American society, his relief and contendedness was found living in isolation in nature, but this is not really allowed in America, and when possible it's only available to those who are able to financially support themselves due to an inheritance or some income stream that they are lucky to find that meshes with their talents and abilities. Also explored in the book was how other cultures around the world have places for hermit-types to go and to live supported for their basic need for food and shelter by society (not financially self-sufficient). Prior to the disassembling of the asylums in the United States, perhaps some of the residents were those who were square pegs.            If you just want to hear the story of who, what, when, where, why and how, all that is here in a short easy read. I finished it off in under 48 hours reading between living my regular life. I could have finished it in one sitting if I wanted to stay up too late or clear my calendar for a morning. But this book provides more food for thought, for me at least, than just Knight's hermit years story. I hope this book is a catalyst for Americans to think about this issue, with the rising rates of Autism and mental illness, we have more people this decade than ever before who are not fitting in with the mandatory American public school system and who are not fitting in to work jobs as adults enough to support themselves independently let alone the issue of if a person is happy or content. When a person suffers now they are labeled as depressed, if they worry too much, they have anxiety. The rise in the use of psychiatric medications to try to help people who are not fitting in with American society's defined \\"right way to function and be\\" is not always successful in converting a person into being something we call cured. We don't just let people be, anyone found to be atypical is trying to be fixed. If relatives take in a family member with what we call a disability or mental illness, the cost of living can be so high that it's hard to afford it. This societal problem is going to get worse in the upcoming decades. But I digress.            This book is a great read that informs and it was written with respect and portrays Knight with dignity. It's not sensationalized for entertainment purposes and it's not patronizing (thank goodness). Rating 5 stars = Love It. This NEEDS TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE so it can reach a wider audience and that income perhaps can support Knight's ability to live the kind of life he needs to feel inner peace and contentment. |||||Summary:","output":"Christopher Knight, a 20-year-old man, decided to leave society and live alone in the forests of Maine.

This results in a more evenly flattened dough. (B) is not the best choice because beer bottles usually have a smaller surface area.

Later in the same quarter, the Vikings increased their lead with an 8-yard TD pass from Favre to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. Closing out the first half was a 3-yard TD pass from Favre to wide receiver Bernard Berrian to make a 21-0 Vikings halftime lead, the first time of the season the Vikings kept their opponent scoreless in the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued to dominate as Favre found wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 7-yard TD pass. Seattle scored their first points of the game when kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 40-yard field goal. Finally, the Vikings put the game away as second-string QB Tarvaris Jackson found Rice again on a 34-yard TD pass. The Seahawks tried to rally with a 1-yard TD run by running back Justin Forsett (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Vikings prevented the Seahawks comeback from advancing any further. With the win, the Vikings improved to 9-1. Brett Favre threw 4 TD passes for the 22nd time in his career (second of the season), breaking the mark set by Dan Marino.

A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The report - made public yesterday but. leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham,. was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated. with extremist views'. It was placed in special measures after. Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex. and relationships education was not taught properly. Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated. The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being. politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the. validity of the inspection. Golden. Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the. Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been. rated inadequate. A. Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock. either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it. did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’ It. said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report,. which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the. appropriate legal channels.' Golden. Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely. believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims. to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation. Trojan Horse. The. Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to. council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked. several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council,. West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted. In. its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been. conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons. Inspectors. who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing. enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according. to PVET's statement. But. the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no. suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates. extremism or radicalisation. It added. that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow. progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the. signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter. this. And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'. It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.' Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010. 'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014. 'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.' PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health. The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met. Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.' 'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.' 'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'

The premise mentions a woman who is standing on a beach and specifies that she is wearing a bathing suit. A bathing suit, also known as swimwear, is a type of clothing designed specifically for swimming or taking part in water-based activities. It typically comes in various forms, such as one-piece suits or bikinis for women. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the woman is wearing a dress. A dress is a garment that is distinct from a bathing suit. It is typically a one-piece outfit made of various materials, designed to be worn from the shoulders to any length below the hips. Dresses are usually worn on social occasions or as part of everyday attire, depending on the style of the dress and the cultural context. Given the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not supported or proven to be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise clearly states that the woman is wearing a bathing suit, which is distinctly different from a dress. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true because it specifically contradicts the information in the hypothesis. Additionally, it is important to note that although the details provided in the premise do not directly support the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is completely false. The woman could possibly change into a dress at a later time or have a dress nearby with intentions of wearing it.

Red Eye is a thrilling film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take the red eye flight. During waiting, she meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) and they sort of become friends. Ironically, both sit right next to each other on this plane.

(Update: Pilot of the American Airlines flight talks to Texas TV station and New Times interviews VP of Phoenix Air Group, who debriefed the Learjet pilot after this incident.)      Pilots over southern Arizona last month reported a mystery object flying above their aircraft in a flight-control recording released by the Federal Aviation Administration.      \\"Was anybody above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" a Phoenix Air Group pilot flying a Learjet at 37,000 feet asked an air traffic controller at about 3:30 p.m. on February 24.      (Click the video above for Twilight Zone-ish radio exchange.)      \\"Negative,\\" said an official with the Federal Aviation Administration's Albuquerque Center.      \\"OK,\\" the pilot responded a few seconds later. \\"Somethin' did.\\"      A few minutes later, an American Airlines Airbus pilot reported seeing the same thing at roughly 40,000 feet over the Sonoran Desert between Picacho and Mammoth.      No one knew what it was.      Now, nobody's saying this is evidence of little green men, but the tape makes for a fun UFO story, clearly. And there's a possible serious side. Even in the likely event that the object has a mundane source, the incident may reveal a potential safety hazard because of its unexpected appearance in the sky.      TheDrive.Com's War Zone page was apparently the first to publish the recording today. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the authenticity of the digital file on Friday and emailed a copy to Phoenix New Times.      The FAA seemed to suggest that yes, this was sort of weird.      \\"Other than the brief conversation between two aircraft, the controller was unable to verify that any other aircraft was in the area,\\" Lynn Lunsford, FAA mid-states public affairs manager, told New Times. \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons.\\"      In other words, the FAA should have heard about a weather balloon or military flight, but didn't.      American Airlines didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.      In the recording, after the Learjet pilot's report, another voice from the sky piped up, \\"UFO!\\"      A man laughed. \\"Yeah.\\"      About three minutes later, officials revealed they were still thinking about the object. Out of the blue, Albuquerque Center alerts the crew of an American Airlines Airbus A321 flying from Dallas to San Diego to be on the lookout for ... something.      \\"American 1095, let me know if you see anything pass over you here in the next 15 miles,\\" the control tower official said.      The pilot's voice reveals his surprise at the question: \\"Over us?\\"      The flight control official replied that a pilot in front of the jetliner reported seeing something \\"and we didn't have any targets,\\" meaning it didn't show up on radar.      Forty-five seconds went by.      \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the American Airlines pilot then reported. \\"Uh, like a — I don't know what it was, but it was at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah, it passed right over the top of us.\\"      A moment later, Albuquerque Center asks the pilot to describe what he saw.      \\"Can you tell us if it was in motion, or just hovering?\\"      The pilot said he couldn't make it out, but the object had a \\"big reflection,\\" was flying \\"several thousand feet above us\\" and going \\"in the opposite direction.\\"      A few seconds later, someone asked the pilot, \\"was it a Google balloon?\\"      \\"Doubtful,\\" he replied.      \\"UFO!\\" someone quipped.      The Arizona mystery comes a few weeks after the War Zone published other material, including audio tapes, of an object seen by pilots flying over Oregon in October.

A Learjet pilot and an American Airlines pilot saw the object on February 24 and radioed the regional air traffic controller in Albuquerque.      \\"Was anybody, uh, above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" the Learjet pilot said in the brief exchange.      \\"Negative,\\" the air traffic controller replied.      \\"Okay,\\" the pilot said. \\"Something did.\\"      \\"A UFO!\\" someone quickly responded.      \\"Yeah,\\" the pilot replied again with a chuckle.      A second sighting      Minutes later, the FAA controller alerted an American Airlines plane that was flying in the area, according to the recording released by the FAA.      \\"American 1095, uh, let me know if, uh, you anything pass over you here in the next, uh, 15 miles,\\" an air traffic controller said.      \\"Let you know if anything passes over?\\" the pilot responded.      \\"American 1095, affirmative,\\" the controller said. \\"We had an aircraft in front of you that reported something pass over him and, uh, we didn't have any targets. So just, uh, let me know if you see anything pass over you.\\"      \\"Alright,\\" the pilot said.      Shortly, the pilot radioed traffic control also reporting the mysterious object.      \\"It's American 1095. Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the pilot said. \\"I don't know what it was, but at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah, it passed right over the top of us.\\"      The American Airlines jet, an Airbus A321, was flying from San Diego to Dallas, according to FlightRadar24.      American Airlines referred all questions to the FAA.      It's unclear whether the object spotted by the pilots was a UFO. An FAA spokesperson suggested the object wasn't necessarily something out of this world.      \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,\\" the FAA spokesperson said.      The controller was unable to verify that any other aircraft was in the area at the time, the FAA said.      Was it a weather balloon?      A pilot said he did not believe the object could be a weather balloon.      When the air controller asked more about the object, the American Airlines pilot said he wasn't sure \\"whether it was a balloon or whatnot.\\"      He only described it as having \\"a big reflection,\\" and \\"traveling several thousand feet above us, going the opposite direction.\\"      The strange encounter happened not far from Roswell, New Mexico -- a town that became synonymous with extraterrestrial activity in 1947 after reports that a flying object crash-landed in a field.

Two airline pilots spotted a mysterious, reflective object hovering some 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) over southern Arizona last month, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is stumped.      According to radio transmissions between the befuddled pilots and air traffic controllers (which you can listen to in full, thanks to an FAA recording recently released to the Phoenix New Times), the sighting occurred around 3:30 p.m. local time on Feb. 24, somewhere over the Sonoran Desert near Phoenix.      \\"Was anybody above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" the first pilot asked while flying a Learjet west toward California. [7 Things Most Often Mistaken for UFOs]      \\"Negative,\\" an air traffic controller at the FAA's Albuquerque Air Traffic Center in New Mexico answered.      \\"OK,\\" the pilot responded. \\"Something did.\\"      The object, whatever it was, was flying high — at least a few thousand feet above the jet, which was cruising at an altitude of around 37,000 feet (11,000 m), the New Times reported. A few minutes later, the FAA asked another nearby flight — an American Airlines Airbus traveling in the same direction — to keep an eye out for anything \\"passing over\\" it in the desert.      The confused pilot agreed. And sure enough, within a few minutes, the Airbus crew saw the same mystery object fly over their plane.      \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the Airbus pilot reported. \\"I couldn't make it out, whether it was a balloon or what … but it had a big reflection on it and it was several thousand feet above us, going the opposite direction.\\"      Several weeks later, authorities are still stumped as to the object's origin. Beyond these two pilot reports, the FAA couldn't verify that any other aircraft were around. It likely wasn't a \\"Google balloon,\\" the FAA reported, nor a weather balloon or a military craft.      \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,\\" an FAA representative told the New Times.      In other words, whatever the UFO was, the FAA should have known about it. But it didn't.      This report comes just a few months after a former Pentagon official revealed that the government has been quietly running an official UFO detection program since 2007. An investigation into the program by The New York Times turned up striking footage taken by two Navy fighter pilots, who appear to encounter a mysterious glowing object midair.      Reports like these may be more common than you imagine. According to the National UFO Reporting Center — an online database of alleged UFO sightings in America — there have been nearly 650 UFO sightings reported so far in 2018.

Recently, I decided to visit the Shutter Falls Restaurant, having heard of its popularity and its 'unique' approach to dining. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my concerns in this detailed negative review. 1. Ambience: To begin with, the ambience of Shutter Falls did not live up to the high standards I was expecting from such a well-known establishment. The interior appeared dimly lit and shabby; draped curtains and poorly spaced seating arrangements made the whole place seem cluttered. Furthermore, the music was obnoxiously loud, making it difficult to have any meaningful conversation with my dining partner. 2. Service: The service was nothing short of abysmal. After being seated, we had to wait for almost 15 minutes just to have our orders taken, despite the restaurant being only half full. The waitstaff seemed untrained and disinterested. They barely made any eye contact and were unresponsive to our requests for recommendations. Additionally, once we placed our orders, it took a good 40 minutes for our food to arrive, which was unacceptable. 3. Food Quality: When our dishes finally arrived, the presentation was lackluster, to say the least. One would expect a restaurant of Shutter Falls' stature to pay careful attention to the plating, which sadly was far from the case. To make matters worse, the taste of the dishes left much to be desired. The Chicken Alfredo we ordered was bland, lacking any flavor or seasoning, while the steak was overcooked, making it tough and chewy. The side dishes were equally disappointing, with undercooked potatoes and a lifeless salad. 4. Price: Honestly, given the quality of the food and service we experienced at Shutter Falls, the prices were outrageously high. We ended up spending close to 100 for a meal that was neither satisfying nor enjoyable. Had the food and service been exceptional, this price point may have been justified, but given the circumstances, it felt like a downright rip-off. 5. Hygiene: During our time at the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how unkempt the place was. The dining area had a musty smell, while the restroom was far from clean. I witnessed a staff member walk out of the restroom without washing her hands, which only deepened my concerns regarding the overall hygiene and safety practices followed at Shutter Falls. In conclusion, my experience at the Shutter Falls Restaurant was decidedly negative. With a disorganized ambience, subpar service, abysmal food quality, inflated prices, and questionable hygiene standards, I regret to say that I will not be recommending this establishment to anyone. Despite the hype and popularity it may have gathered, my time at Shutter Falls was marked by disappointment and discomfort. There are many other fine dining options in the city that offer much better value for money, and I will be turning to those establishments in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.  - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Lysaker is an area in Bærum municipality, Akershus county, Norway. Lysaker is the easternmost part of Bærum, and borders Oslo proper. Lysaker was initially a farming community, later becoming a residential area. Today it is primarily known as a business and trade area, and a public transport hub. It is considered part of Stor-Oslo (Greater Oslo), and is home to offices of numerous domestic and international businesses.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015  25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator . Though based in Lysaker outside Oslo , Norway the company operates in the United States and Brazil .  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania.

Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall.  - Haakon V Magnusson (10 April 1270 - 8 May 1319) (Old Norse: \\"Hákon Magnússon\\"; Norwegian: \\"Håkon Magnusson\\") was king of Norway from 1299 until 1319.  - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland.  - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\".   - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north.  - The Scandinavian Peninsula (;  \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia.  - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262).

The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act. Dumbo just feels even worse, but Timothy manages to take him to see his Mother, which cheers him up a little. Later on in the evening, Dumbo develops the hiccups, and Timothy finds a tub of water in the clown's tent. However, one of the clowns has knocked some liquor into it, and Dumbo and Timothy end up getting tipsy, and soon start hallucinating, seeing pink... My question: Who dislikes the Job and now more miserable than ever?

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert.       In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto? Answer:","output":"The person who made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto is the composer himself, Sir William Walton. Although he was a reluctant conductor, Walton conducted many of the EMI recordings, which included these works, as well as some for other labels. Walton's contributions to the world of music have been widely recognized and appreciated, with numerous recordings of his compositions available for commercial release."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Question: Which is probably true of the author? Options:  A. not enough information  B. The author is physically fit  C. They author is an accountability coach  D. The author is controlling  === The correct answer is","output":"A. not enough information It is important to recognize that the diet cycle mentality can be a significant obstacle to achieving long-term weight loss and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is often rooted in the belief that there is a 'magic cure' or 'one last diet' that will solve all weight-related problems, but, in reality, these are just stories people tell themselves as a way of rationalizing their inability to lose weight and keep it off permanently. To break free from this mentality, it is essential to explore the reasons why these narratives do not hold true and to understand that lasting change and improved health require consistent effort, commitment, and a focus on holistic well-being. This means addressing not only diet but also exercise, stress management, self-care, and emotional health. Instead of relying on quick-fix promises and false beliefs, it can be helpful to cultivate awareness around your eating habits, reflect on your relationship with food, and consider the various factors that influence your choices. This deeper self-inquiry may reveal that addressing the root causes of your weight issues requires more specific strategies tailored to your unique physical and emotional needs. Additionally, working with experts like nutritionists, exercise professionals, and therapists can provide support and guidance on your journey toward a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Accountability and community can be powerful motivators in helping you stay on track and make lasting changes. Finally, remember that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It involves resilience, adaptability, and self-compassion. By acknowledging the inherent flaws of the diet cycle mentality and committing to nurturing healthier habits, you can break free from this exhausting and self-defeating cycle and move toward a life of sustainable well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE) is the period in the history of the Indian subcontinent intervening between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization, and a second urbanisation which began in c. 600 BCE. It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan.  Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \\"Indo-Aryan Controversy\\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \\"enjoy significant international currency\\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \\"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\\"  The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", which borrowed \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. Are there specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period?","output":"Yes, the specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period or Vedic age are around 1500 BCE. This period is marked by the migration of Indo-Aryan peoples into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent following the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period continued until around 600 BCE, when a second urbanization began in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not only did Market Basket continue to expand and reap profits â€” generating 4 billion in revenues in 2012 â€” but workers have thrived as well. Full-time clerks start at 12 an hour. Cashiers with experience can earn over 40,000 a year. And managers can easily make into the six figures. Keep in mind that's in a nation where the average annual salary for grocery store cashiers is 21,370 and the national minimum wage is 7.25 per hour. The company also has a generous retirement plan, matching 15% of annual salary to employee retirement funds. What's more, workers up and down the supply chain receive good bonuses throughout the year. All this and Market Basket is affordable for customers, with prices regularly 10% to 20% lower than competitors. The company is profitable in an industry known for low profit margins, and has given 500 million in dividends to the nine family shareholders over the past decade. In other words, at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies cannot pay workers well and be successful in generating profits, Market Basket has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary. Market Basket has been a good company all around -- until recently, when things changed. So what happened? Well, the family board switched sides, ousted Arthur T. and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. One of the first acts under Arthur S. was to distribute 250 million in profits to the nine family shareholders, what a Boston Globe editorial called \\"an uncharacteristic act of greed for a firm known for its generous treatment of its workers and concern for price-conscious shoppers.\\" There have been other ominous signs that Arthur S. and his allies plan to push profit at all costs -- at the expense of workers and the values of the company. And so in an unprecedented mobilization, managers and workers have protested at Market Baskets across New England, calling for their beloved CEO Artie T. to be reinstated. Last week, more than 6,000 Market Basket workers and managers joined in a peaceful march outside the company's headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. If you go to any Market Basket store around New England right now, you're likely to find employees and even some customers holding up signs protesting the new executive and supporting the ousted Artie T. Employees are also using social media to get their message out, using hashtags like #MarketBasket. Of course, if you go inside a Market Basket you're not likely to find much; even the warehouse workers are on strike. These protests aren't being organized by unions; after all, Market Basket workers aren't unionized. They're being organized by the employees and managers of the company. Already, eight managers have been fired for helping lead the protests. But the protests continue. As a result, the company is reportedly losing 1 million a day. A reporter interviewed one of the Market Basket workers at a protest. \\"I have a friend who works at Walmart,\\" she said, \\"and I asked her, would they ever do this for their CEO?\\" The woman laughed. But what has become of capitalism in America is not funny: the extreme greed of a few overrunning the best interests of everyone, including workers, communities and a healthy growing economy. Just like the Occupy Wall Street protesters before them, the Market Basket workers are not protesting against capitalism. They're protesting for a certain kind of capitalism, a capitalism that works for owners as well as for workers and communities. It's the kind of capitalism that has made Market Basket a successful business for generations, the kind of capitalism that once meant shared prosperity and opportunity in America. The Market Basket managers and cashiers and bag boys joining in protest aren't just holding signs, they're also holding the aspirations of the majority of Americans. Those of us concerned about the growing economic inequality in America don't want to \\"eat the rich\\" â€” we simply don't want the rich to chew up and spit out everyone else. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Market Basket is a chain of 71 supermarkets in New England, known for treating its workers exceptionally well, with high salaries, good bonuses, and a generous retirement plan. They have managed to be a successful and profitable business with affordable prices for customers despite these employee benefits. However, recently, the company's board ousted Arthur T. Demoulas, a popular president who cared for employee welfare, and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. Under Arthur S., the company has taken actions that are more focused on profits at the expense of the workers and company values. In response, an unprecedented mobilization of employees and managers have been protesting at Market Basket stores across New England, calling for the reinstatement of Arthur T. Demoulas as CEO. This protest is not against capitalism, but rather in support of a fair and balanced capitalism that promotes shared prosperity and works for both owners and employees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Aubrey asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced and did a poor job.  Given the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\", is \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\". The given sentence only describes the situation and the reason behind Riley's poor performance, but it does not provide any information on the possible consequences or future outcomes for Riley. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\" could be: The outcome for Riley will depend on various factors, including how Aubrey and other team members react to the situation, the support and guidance that Riley receives, and Riley's own ability to learn and grow from this experience. 1. Aubrey's reaction: Aubrey's response to Riley's poor performance will play a significant role in determining what happens to Riley. If Aubrey is understanding and recognizes that Riley needs more guidance and support, they may offer to mentor Riley or pair them with a more experienced team member to help build their skills. Alternatively, Aubrey might decide to assign Riley a different role or responsibility more suited to their current skill level. 2. Team members' reaction: The reaction of other team members to Riley's performance can also influence Riley's future at the company. If the team is supportive and understanding, Riley may have an opportunity to learn from their mistake and improve their performance in the future. However, if the team is not supportive or does not trust Riley's ability to improve, it could lead to a negative work environment and potentially harm Riley's career growth. 3. Riley's willingness to learn and grow: Another crucial factor in determining what will happen to Riley is their personal attitude and willingness to learn from their mistakes. If Riley is proactive in seeking feedback, developing their skills, and adapting their work methods, they may overcome their inexperience and eventually excel in their role. On the other hand, if Riley is unwilling to accept responsibility for their mistakes and does not take steps to improve, they may continue to struggle and face negative consequences, such as being removed from their current position or having difficulty advancing in their career. 4. Support and resources provided to Riley: The resources and support Riley has access to will also significantly impact their ability to grow and succeed. If the company provides training opportunities, mentorship programs, or other resources that help Riley develop their skills, they will be more likely to overcome their inexperience and become a valuable asset to the team. If these resources are not provided or are limited, Riley may continue to face challenges in their role. Overall, the outcome for Riley will be dependent on multiple factors, and it is essential to consider these aspects when determining what will happen to them. A supportive environment, opportunities for growth, and a willingness to learn and adapt can help Riley overcome their inexperience and achieve success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was excited about his new magic card and wanted to have some fun, so he used it to buy lots and lots of things, like toys, video games, and fancy clothes.  When Jim finished college, he got a very big surprise. His magic card wasn't as magical as he thought. It added up all the things he bought, and he now owed 10,000! That's like a huge mountain of coins that he had to pay back.  Jim realized he made a big, silly mistake by spending so much money using his magic card. It was time for Jim to learn how to be responsible. He decided to find a job so that he could add money back into his piggy bank and pay off his big mountain of debt. Jim worked very hard every day to make money. Each time he got paid, he used some of that money to pay off the big mountain of debt. Slowly, the mountain became smaller and smaller. During this time, Jim also learned how to be smart with his magic card and only buy what he could really afford. After a while, Jim finally paid off all his debt!

Harry was installing a TV mount. He drills into the wall with a screw that has 20 threads. If he used a screw of the same size with 30 threads, it would take fewer or more turns to put it in? Answer:","output":"Answer: more turns Explanation: The passage states that when the threads are closer together, more turns of the screw or bolt are needed to complete the job. In this scenario, Harry is using a screw with 20 threads for installing a TV mount. If he were to use a screw of the same size but with 30 threads, the threads would be closer together. According to the passage, this would mean that it would take more turns to put the screw with 30 threads in, as the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

Ireland, known for its scenic beauty and rich cultural history, primarily consists of white ethnic group; this demographic detail contributes to the backdrop against which these narratives unfold, adding an extra layer of cultural observation and critique.  Dublin, being the largest city in Ireland, implicitly becomes a significant spatial reference in the books, its spirit encapsulated through the nuanced descriptions, incidents, and shared histories experienced by the characters.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (; 27 January 1832 - 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon, and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections, conservative and High Church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin. His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies. The older of these sons - yet another Charles Dodgson - was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827 and became a country parson.  Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at Daresbury in Cheshire near the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years.  Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining to Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.  The young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\", a stammer that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.  The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \\"facts\\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.  Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades.  In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on December 22, 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\" When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added:  I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \\"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\\"  Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \\"Practical Tortoise Raising\\". Did his views affect his work?","output":"Yes, Charles Dodgson's views and personal experiences did have an impact on his work, often in subtle and indirect ways. As an author, mathematician, logician, and Anglican deacon, his writings and ideas often reflected his beliefs, interests, and the life he led. Here are some of the ways in which his views and experiences influenced his work: 1. Literary Nonsense and Wordplay: Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a master of literary nonsense and wordplay. His most famous works, such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, are rich in puns, paradoxes, and seemingly nonsensical verses. His fascination with language and logic can be seen in the way he played with words and created surreal situations in his writings, which might be partially inspired by his struggles with his stammer and finding ways to communicate effectively. 2. Religious Themes: As an Anglican deacon, Dodgson's religious beliefs did appear in some of his works. The Hunting of the Snark, for instance, contains references to the religious concept of redemption and forgiveness. Similarly, his adherence to High Church Anglican principles is also demonstrated in Sylvie and Bruno, one of his lesser-known works, which includes themes of faith, virtue, and the importance of prayer. 3. Mathematical and Logical Puzzles: Dodgson's passion for mathematics and logic is evident in his writings as well. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the characters Alice encounters and the challenges she faces are often underpinned by mathematical concepts. For example, Alice's changes in size can be seen as a metaphor for understanding mathematical concepts such as ratio and proportion. Furthermore, the puzzles and riddles featured in his works, including \\"The Mad Hatter's Tea Party,\\" encompass logical brainteasers that require readers to think critically. 4. Exploration of Identity and Personal Experience: Dodgson's personal experiences and his struggles with his stammer, as well as the question of identity, are also present in his works. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's journey can be seen as a symbolic exploration of identity and personal growth, where she tries to make sense of the nonsensical world around her. Moreover, some scholars speculate that Dodgson might have identified with the character of the Dodo, who has difficulty pronouncing his name, as a reflection of his own problems with pronunciation because of his stammer. 5. Conservative Views: While his conservative political and religious views are not always overt in his works, they nonetheless set the tone and context for some of his writings. His conservative approach to life and strict adherence to social norms informed his storytelling, which often revolved around questioning and challenging established norms and assumptions, while still rooting his stories in a traditional, Victorian sense of propriety. In conclusion, Charles Dodgson's views, beliefs, and personal experiences indeed influenced his work in various ways, shaping not only the content but also the themes and stylistic choices within his writings. As a result, his body of work can be seen as a reflection of his multifaceted personality and the diverse range of interests he pursued throughout his life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He called me because he knew me from a case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter. Maybe there is an easy, no-brainer answer to what appears to be a potential disqualification issue for both Menzing and his firm (remember the mad cow disease of legal ethics? ) but if you were not already aware of Menzing's prior employer, I thought I'd let you know.

Question: What links the two sides of the ravine? Movie title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood.

This was a very big and powerful weapon that caused a lot of damage and hurt many people. They did this because they wanted to end the war quickly and save the lives of their soldiers. Some people think it was right because it stopped the war, but others think it was wrong because of all the people it hurt.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Archâgather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found. Kit and Rob put together some clues and realizing that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \\"Muffy\\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy.

As the story unfolds, it is revealed that there is an underlying mystery which involves Muffy, one of the characters, having a violently insane twin sister named Buffy. The plot takes a dark turn as the remaining group members begin to vanish or are found dead. The group of college friends - Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Arch - gather to celebrate Spring Break at the island mansion of their friend, and Skip's sister, Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fool's Day. Various pranks are set by Muffy, and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that not all these jokes are as harmless as they initially appear.  As characters in the group go missing, it becomes more urgent for the remaining friends to solve the mystery. Kit catches a glimpse of what appears to be Skip's dead body, and as search efforts intensify, Nikki falls into the island's well and discovers the severed heads of Skip and Arch, as well as Nan's dead body. With no way to leave the island and no working phones, the friends become increasingly desperate to uncover the truth behind the killings. As Kit and Rob delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to piece together clues that lead them to the revelation of Muffy having a twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped from a psychiatric facility and is posing as Muffy. In a twist, they find what they believe to be Muffy's severed head in the basement, and the chase with Buffy begins. The plot of April Fool's Day provides the tension of a horror film, mixed with elements of mystery, as the group of friends attempt to uncover the identity of the killer. It is important to consider the balance between the horror elements and the film's suspense before deciding whether or not to invest in the film proposal.

Choices: 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"To answer the first question, let's analyze the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Mario is a well-rounded character with no major weaknesses. He has good speed, decent power, and great combo potential. Be aware that his recovery is somewhat limited. 2. Utilize his fireball projectiles: Use Mario's fireball to pressure opponents from a distance and force them to approach or make mistakes. 3. Master Mario's combo game: Learn Mario's combo moves, such as his down throw to up tilt and up air strings. This will let you build damage quickly and maintain stage control. 4. Edgeguard with FLUDD and cape: Use Mario's FLUDD move to push opponents away from the stage, and his cape to turn them around and mess up their recovery attempts. 5. Utilize the Super Jump Punch for vertical recovery and kills: Mario's up special, the Super Jump Punch, can be used to recover back to the stage and can also finish opponents off at high percentages. Now let's analyze the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Dr. Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Dr. Mario is a slower, more powerful version of Mario. He deals more damage and has stronger knockback, but is slower and has a weaker recovery. 2. Utilize his faster, bouncier pills: Use Dr. Mario's pills to pressure opponents from a distance, as they are more difficult to predict and react to than Mario's fireballs. 3. Focus on powerful hit confirms: Dr. Mario has stronger smash attacks and aerials than Mario, so connecting with them is essential to securing kills. 4. Master Dr. Mario's Tornado as a recovery tool: His down special, Dr. Tornado, can help with recovery when used in conjunction with his double jump.  5. Punish opponents with his forward aerial: Dr. Mario's \\"Dr. Punch\\" is a powerful kill move that can take stocks early if used effectively. Are these two questions asking the same thing?

A state of emergency has been declared. The pylons brought electricity from Ukraine. Engineers were reportedly denied access to the site by Ukrainian activists. Crimea was annexed by Russia last year, but the Ukrainian authorities have continued to supply power to the area. Images on social media show Ukrainian flags on some damaged pylons - and Crimean Tatar flags on others. Crimean authorities said they had managed to partially reconnect the cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Saky using generators. But more than 1.6 million people remain without power, and water supplies to high buildings have stopped and cable and mobile internet is down. Some 150 schools were also without power. \\"I had no electricity all night. These useless officials can't run the city  and they still haven't built a local power station,\\" a resident of Sevastopol told AFP news agency. \\"It's not the first time Ukraine has cut off electricity to Crimea, we are  already used to power cuts and stock up on batteries,\\" another one said.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues.   Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic.  Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook \\"Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats\\" lists this condition as \\"very common\\" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age.   Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time   Disc disease:  This is another \\"common\\" condition, especially as Cavaliers age.  Most of the time, you won't know that your Cavalier is prone to slip discs, until you see it walking stiffly or reluctantly lowering its head to its food or water bowl.

Gadi Schwartz reports for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015)      A flash flood warning was issued Wednesday for San Bernardino County during punishing monsoonal weather in Southern California.      The warning was in effect for the Big Bear area, including the Lake Fire burn area, until 6:30 p.m. Tuesday due to lightning, hail and between 1 and 2 inches of rain per hour from monsoonal flow in Mexico.      Send Us Your Weather Photos: Use #NBC4You      The alert comes as temperatures and humidity levels rose to uncomfortable levels across Southern California at the start of a heat wave expected to last until early next week, and perilous conditions characterized by strong rip currents and high surf will prevail along the coast until tonight.      Top News Photos of the Week      Flash flooding submerged some major intersections and streets with water in Victorville and made it difficult for motorists to travel.      One motorist who got out of his vehicle was swept away by the flood and ended up in a storm drain. Rescuers recovered the man but his condition was unknown.      At Victor Valley College in Victorville, rain left some buildings with leaks and the storm knocked over several trees around the campus.      \\"The combination of high pressure aloft and weak offshore flow will bring very hot weather to much of Southwestern California,\\" according to the National Weather Services.      2015 Southern California Images in the News      Forecasters said \\"slight cooling\\" is expected Friday and Saturday, although temperatures will not be returning to normal until early next week.      \\"The prolonged heat wave will bring a risk of heat-related illness through much of the week. Those at highest risk include children, the elderly, and pets without adequate shelter,\\" warned the statement, which noted that the heat would heighten electricity use throughout the region, \\"increasing the threat of power outages.\\"      The NWS forecast highs today in the mid 90s in metropolitan Los Angeles and the low 100s in the San Gabriel, San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys as well as inland Orange County.      \\"Maximum temperatures will reach dangerous levels across much of Southern California this week,\\" according to the NWS.      \\"The peak of the heat wave will be Wednesday and Thursday, although today and Friday will only be a few degrees cooler. It will be cooler over the weekend, although maximum temperatures will remain well above normal. Temperatures are expected to return to near normal by early next week.\\"      Temperatures Tuesday and during the rest of the heat wave will be running 10-15 degrees higher than normal, said NWS meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie.      The high heat is being attributed to high pressure developing over the region, combined with the fact that only weak winds are blowing in from the ocean.      Also afflicting the region is high humidity, which is forecast to be at the 50 percent level in the coastal plains -- the norm is 20-30 percent -- and around 40 percent in valley areas, compared to the teens, which would be normal, Hoxsie said.      The humidity is attributed to lingering moisture from Hurricane Linda. The conditions prompted the NWS to issue an excessive heat warning for the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains in both Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with highs of 105 expected at low elevations, and the San Fernando, San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys.      It will be in force from 11 a.m. today until 8 p.m. Thursday. Normally, excessive heat warnings are issued when humidity levels stand to make temperatures feel even hotter than they are, but in this instance the warning would have been issued in any event as a result of the high temperatures, Hoxsie said.      Forecasters said those at greatest risk of suffering heat-related ailments were infants, the elderly, the homeless, outdoor workers and people taking part in outdoor activities in the heat. They urged residents to drink plenty of water; wear light-colored and lightweight clothing; stay out of the midday sun; check on neighbors and the elderly to make sure they are not being overwhelmed by the heat; and never, ever leave children, the elderly, or pets in a vehicle parked in hot weather.      The NWS forecast sunny skies today and highs of 81 in San Clemente; 82 in Avalon; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 86 at LAX; 92 on Mount Wilson; 97 in Irvine, Anaheim, Long Beach and downtown L.A.; 98 in Mission Viejo and San Gabriel; 99 in Fullerton; 100 in Yorba Linda, Palmdale and Burbank; 101 in Lancaster; 102 in Pasadena and Saugus; and 105 in Woodland Hills.      Temperatures will be a couple of degrees higher in several communities on Wednesday and start a cooling trend on Friday. By Monday, many communities that will have withstood temperatures in the 90s and above will be back in the 80s. Along the coast, high surf is expected through tonight as a result of a long-period swell in the Pacific, said the NWS, adding that the highest surf -- 3 to 6 feet, with 7-foot sets -- will pound south- and southwest-facing beaches.      \\"Strong, frequent rip currents will continue to be a significant hazard,\\" an NWS statement said. Anyone who plans to swim in the ocean today should do so near a lifeguard, the NWS urged, adding that beachgoers must avoid climbing on rocks or jetties because of the risk of being scooped up by \\"sneaker waves.\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Answer:","output":"Shropshire Blue and Limburger are types of cheese, each originating from different countries and having unique characteristics in terms of flavor, texture, production methods, and aging process. They belong to the wide category of food known as dairy products, which are derived from animal milk. Let's delve deeper into the specific features of each cheese. 1. Shropshire Blue: Shropshire Blue is a semi-soft, blue-veined cheese originating in the United Kingdom. Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not actually produced in Shropshire but was initially developed in Scotland in the 1970s. The cheese was named after Shropshire to help boost its marketing and sales appeal. Today, it is mainly produced in the counties of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire in the English Midlands. The cheese is made using pasteurized cow's milk and employs the same blue mold spores (Penicillium roqueforti) and production methods used for making Stilton, another famous and well-loved British blue cheese. Shropshire Blue has a rich, creamy texture and a somewhat sharp and tangy flavor. The aging process typically lasts for about 12 weeks, resulting in the development of the cheese's distinctive blue-green veins that run through the characteristic deep-orange body. Shropshire Blue is an excellent choice for a cheese board and pairs well with various fruits, particularly pears, grapes, and figs. It is also commonly used in salads and sauces, and its unique flavor complements red wine or port. 2. Limburger: Limburger is a semi-soft, surface-ripened cheese that originates from the historical Duchy of Limburg, now comprising parts of modern-day Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Created in the 19th century by Belgian Trappist monks, Limburger quickly gained popularity across Europe, especially in Germany. The cheese crossed the Atlantic to the United States in the 19th century, where it continues to be produced today, primarily in Monroe, Wisconsin, known as the Limburger capital of the U.S. The cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk and is known for its pungent aroma, which results from the action of bacteria (Brevibacterium linens) used in the production process. The smell of Limburger is often compared to the odor of sweaty feet due to the same bacterium being naturally present on human skin. Despite its strong smell, Limburger has a mild, creamy taste with an underlying earthiness and slightly tangy aftertaste. Limburger is aged for about 4-16 weeks, during which its texture becomes softer and the flavor profile intensifies. Its edible rind turns from a pale yellow to a darker brownish-orange during the ripening process. Limburger is often consumed in a popular sandwich called a \\"Limburger sandwich,\\" which usually contains rye bread, a thick slice of Limburger cheese, and raw onions, served with strong black coffee or lager beer. In conclusion, Shropshire Blue and Limburger are two distinct types of cheese, each having their unique flavors, aromas, and textures. Both of these cheeses are enjoyed by cheese enthusiasts worldwide and can be found in various culinary applications, from cheese boards and sandwiches to salads and sauces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: While traveling through the Southern United States in around 1998, Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime, which he described as \`\`raging and painful and tragic (sic)''. The billboards highlighted the incompetence of police work and deeply affected McDonagh; he said that the image \`\`stayed in my mind (...) kept gnawing at me'' and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother. This incident, combined with his desire to create strong female characters, inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \`\`(decide) that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction (...) based on a couple of actual billboards''. Question: three billboards outside ebbing missouri is a real story? Pick your answer from: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","output":"[1]. No. Although \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by real-life events and circumstances, it is not a strictly factual narrative or a direct retelling of an existing story. When Martin McDonagh traveled through the Southern United States in 1998, he came across billboards about an unsolved crime, which left a deep impression on him. This experienced stayed in McDonagh's mind and heavily influenced the creation of the storyline in \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\\" The billboards McDonagh saw might have been put up by the victim's mother, and this presumption eventually gave birth to the strong, complex character of Mildred, the protagonist in the film. McDonagh was also driven to create powerful female characters, and this further contributed to the development of the movie's narrative. The creative process took about a decade as McDonagh closely examined the real-life billboard incident and eventually shaped it into a work of fiction. This transformation resulted in the dark comedy-drama film \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\\" which weaves a tale of grief, anger, and search for justice in a small American town.  In summary, while \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by a real-life event that moved the writer-director, this movie is a fictional story that brings to life a range of human emotions and themes, enhancing the narrative and engaging the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I finish 4 essays in 3 days? 3 men or 4 women can do a piece of work in 43 days, then how long will 7 men and 5 women together will take to finish the same work? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"First, let's look at both questions separately. Question 1: How do I finish 4 essays in 3 days? Step 1: Determine the total hours available in 3 days, assuming 8 hours of focused work each day: 3 days * 8 hours/day = 24 hours Step 2: Divide the total time by the number of essays. 24 hours / 4 essays = 6 hours/essay Step 3: Allocate 6 hours for researching, writing, and editing each essay, since each essay should take equal time. Step 4: Work on each essay for 6 hours, one essay per day while completing one-third of the fourth essay. Step 5: On the third day, after finishing the third essay, complete the remaining two-thirds of the fourth essay. Now let's look at the second question: Question 2: 3 men or 4 women can do a piece of work in 43 days, then how long will 7 men and 5 women together will take to finish the same work? Step 1: Calculate one man's and one woman's work per day by assuming that 3 men = 4 women. If 3 men take 43 days to finish the work, in one day they complete 1/43 of the work. Therefore, one man completes (1/43)/3 = 1/129 of the work in a day. Since 3 men = 4 women, one woman completes (1/43)/4 = 1/172 of the work in a day. Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate of 7 men and 5 women. 7 men = 7 * (1/129), and 5 women = 5 * (1/172). Add these two rates to find the combined rate: 7*(1/129) + 5*(1/172) = 7/129 + 5/172 = (7*172 + 5*129)/(129*172) = (1194 + 645) / (22188) = 1839/22188. Step 3: Calculate how long it will take 7 men and 5 women to complete the work at their combined work rate. Since they complete 1839/22188 of the work in a day, the time they take to complete the work is 22188/1839 = 12 days. To answer your question about whether these questions are the same: No, they are not the same. The first question is about dividing available time between tasks and organizing your work, while the second question deals with solving work rate problems involving different groups working together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude?  A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant. A:","output":"The last names of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude are Stoichita and Coderch."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reason for this rating is that both sentences convey the action of a deer jumping over a fence. However, there are some subtle differences between the two sentences.  The first sentence, \\"A deer jumps a fence\\", is in the simple present tense, and it describes a specific event in which a deer is jumping a fence. This could imply that the speaker is observing the event happening at present, or describing a habit or general action. The second sentence, \\"A deer jumping over a fence\\", is a noun phrase, with \\"jumping\\" acting as a present participle. It is describing a deer in the process of jumping over a fence, without necessarily relating the action to a specific time or event. This phrase can be used in various contexts – for instance, as a caption for a photo or as part of a longer sentence. So while both sentences communicate the same general idea – that a deer is leaping over a fence – the grammatical structure and implied context slightly differ.

But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring cities are situated in a volcanic area with lots of earthquakes.

This is because Park City is situated near a very active volcano, and as the article states, the number and size of earthquakes increase before a volcanic eruption due to magma pushing upwards into the magma chamber. This movement leads to a buildup of stress on neighboring rocks, causing the ground to shake. Since Hill City is situated 50 miles north and not as close to the active volcano, it is expected to experience less motion and stress on neighboring rocks compared to Park City. However, it is important to note that specific geological factors and local conditions in the area could influence the distribution of stresses, and further investigation may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Information:  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems is the seventh studio album of country music singer Kenny Chesney, released in 2002 by BNA Records.

A music video was made for \\"Live Those Songs\\", which charted at number 60 without being released as a single. \\"The Good Stuff\\" was the biggest hit of Chesney's career at the time, not only spending seven weeks at the top of the country charts, but also becoming \\"Billboard\\"'s Number One country single of 2002 according to \\"Billboard\\" Year-End. In 2004, the album earned a 4× Platinum certification for sales of four million copies in the U.S.  - \`\` Big Star '' is a song written by Stephony Smith , and recorded by American country music singer Kenny Chesney .

Question: This article: In June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \\"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\\" and for his having \\"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\".In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \\"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \\"Lumberjack Song\\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building.

Article:","output":"Title: 96-Year-Old Hungarian Police Officer Charged with War Crimes from World War II A 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, has been charged with war crimes committed during World War II, according to the AP. Kepiro is alleged to have ordered the killing of four civilians during a massacre that took place in Serbia, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization, found new evidence of Kepiro's involvement in the atrocities thanks to recently uncovered documents in Belgrade. This is not the first time Kepiro has faced charges for war crimes; Hungarian courts had convicted him twice in the 1940s. However, the first conviction was overturned on retrial, and the second was dismissed when the court documents were lost. As a result, Kepiro had previously been included on a list of top war criminals sought by the Weisenthal Center. Despite the new evidence, Kepiro remains unwavering in his assertion of innocence. In a phone interview, he stated, \\"I am innocent and need to be acquitted. I am bedridden and can't leave my home. I have nothing.\\" Although currently in poor health and unable to leave his residence, Kepiro now faces renewed efforts to hold him accountable for his alleged actions during World War II. This case highlights the ongoing pursuit of justice by organizations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the importance of continued efforts in locating and prosecuting individuals accused of war crimes, regardless of age or time passed since the alleged acts. The newly uncovered documents from Belgrade have provided fresh evidence and a chance for the victims' families to seek closure and justice, no matter how many years have passed since the crimes occurred. In conclusion, the charging of the 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, demonstrates a continued commitment to seeking and upholding justice for war crimes committed during World War II. Though many years have passed since the crimes were committed, this case illustrates the determination to hold perpetrators accountable and serves as a reminder that justice can prevail even after significant delays."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez, who held a press conference outside the hospital, said the shooting happened at the Annie Coleman apartment complex near NW 60th Street and 20th Avenue at around 10 p.m.      “Today we had a very scary incident.

It’s unknown if shooters had any idea they targets were cops.      One of the officers returned fire. It’s not known if a suspect was hit or not.      A witness said she was on the phone with her boyfriend, who lives in the neighborhood, when she heard over two dozen shots.      Police from multiple agencies set up a very large perimeter, extending as far as NW 56th Street.      CBS4’s Silva Harapetian noted there were several helicopters in the air assisting in the search and saw SWAT passing through the area.

Ortega was told by police that they do not have anyone in custody at this time.      Authorities have not said how many people they are looking for at this time. Detectives did say one suspect is a black male between 17 or 18 years old.      The officers were rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in the back of a pick-up truck.      CBS4’s Hank Tester was able to confirm the two officers are in stable condition.      Perez was joined by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez at the press conference outside the hospital.      “As the director said, this was a brazen act of violence committed against two of our finest officers. They’re there trying to protect us and this community, and they were ambushed and we’re not gonna tolerate it,” said Gimenez.      Both Perez and Gimenez asked that the community step forward and provide all they information they have to help find those responsible.      “We need you now to step up to the plate. And if you know something, if you saw something, say something,” Perez said. “These people, if they are willing to do that to our own officers, are causing havoc in our community, causing chaos in people’s live, putting people below the ground. That’s what these guys are, murders in our community. So let’s work together to find a resolution to what occurred tonight.”      Gimenez added, “You can tell by their tone and also the look on their faces that we are all united.”      If you have any information that can help police, please contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

The officers, who are members of a violent crime task force, were ambushed at about 10 p.m. while they were conducting surveillance at an apartment complex in the 1900 block of Northwest 59th Street as part of a multi-agency operation on gang activity, Maj. Hector Llevat said.      \\"One of the officers was able to return fire,\\" Llevat said. \\"Individuals like this that have the audacity to ambush a vehicle unprovoked and open fire like that are individuals in this community that are causing havoc and terrorizing this community day in and day out. These are the officers that were out here to put a stop to that.\\"      Officers in the area sprung to action after the shooting.      \\"They could smell the gunpowder,\\" Miami-Dade police Director Juan Perez said. \\"They were running after the smell of gunpowder, trying to find these individuals.\\"      The wounded officers were rushed to the hospital in the bed of a pickup truck and were able to limp inside with the help of their colleagues. They were identified Tuesday as Terence White and Charles Woods. White is a 26-year veteran of the Miami-Dade Police Department, while Woods is an 11-year veteran.      \\"We do whatever we have to do to save our officers,\\" Perez said. \\"We got lucky tonight that the officers will survive. It's not going to deter us. In fact, what this does is the opposite. This burns a fire inside of us right now to continue to work even harder.\\"      The officers were in stable condition at the hospital Monday night while the shooters remained at large. Woods, who was shot in the leg, has been released from the hospital.      \\"These are the people who are shooting our kids,\\" Perez said. \\"These are the people that shoot at the Martin Luther King parade. These are the people who are causing that havoc in our community, and we're not going to stop. This isn't going to deter us from doing our jobs. This is going to ignite a bigger fire within us to protect our citizens, our communities and our neighborhoods here in Miami-Dade.\\"      Perez asked the public for prayers for the two injured officers and called on anyone with information about the shooting to come forward.      \\"That's what these guys are, murderers in our community. So let's get together, let's work together, to find a resolution to what occurred here tonight,\\" he said. \\"Point us in the right direction.\\"      Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez echoed Perez's message and said attacks on officers will not be tolerated.      \\"You can see by the tone and also the look on their faces, we're all united,\\" Gimenez said. \\"Whoever perpetrated this crime against our two officers, we're going to do everything in our power to arrest them and bring them to justice.\\"      He asked for those with information to come forward.      \\"If they can shoot a police officer, they can shoot at anybody,\\" Gimenez said. \\"So we want to put these perpetrators away before they hurt anyone else or, God forbid, kill somebody else, because they have no regard for anything in our community. They don't deserve to be walking the streets of Miami-Dade County.\\"      Police released a description of one of the two shooters.

Copyright 2017 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved. ||||| MIAMI – The search is on for a pair of gunmen who ambushed two undercover Miami-Dade detectives at the Annie Coleman apartment complex, CBS Miami reports.      Miami-Dade Police      The officers, who are assigned to the Homicide Street Violence Task Force, were inside an unmarked vehicle in the parking lot of the complex at 1937 NW 60 Street around 10 p.m. Monday when they came under fire.      “They were conducting surveillance for gang activity when they were ambushed in their vehicle. Two subjects opened fire on the officers and they ended up being injured. One of the officers was able to return fire,” said police Major Hector Llevat.      One detective was shot in the leg, the other in the arm.      An arriving officer rushed the two detectives to the Jackson Ryder Trauma Center in the back of a black pickup truck.      On Tuesday morning, one of the detectives was listed in stable condition. The other was treated and released, police said.      “They are lucky to be alive. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a car hit by so many rounds. A high powered weapon struck that vehicle and the officers should be counting their blessings today. We certainly are counting our blessings. Hopefully, the community will come through for us and whoever has information on the perpetrators responsible for the vicious attack on our officers, in this ambush type attack, will come forward,” said Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez.      CBS Miami      “This was a brazen act of violence committed against two of our finest officers. They’re there trying to protect us and this community, and they were ambushed and we’re not gonna tolerate it,” said Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez.      One of the injured officers is a 26-year veteran of the force, the other an 11-year veteran.      Officers from multiple agencies are involved in the search for the gunmen. Police helicopters assisted in the search from the air as SWAT teams hit the surrounding streets.

Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Plants and animals long ago died - They are buried under layers of soil - Pressure builds over time - The remains liquefy - The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance.  suppose more plants and die died happens, how will it affect MORE oil.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"Your question seems to suggest an involvement in the process of oil formation, which is a result of plants and animals dying, eventually becoming buried under layer upon layer of soil, and the intense pressure and heat over the course of millions of years causing these remains to become transformed into oil. The process is a direct result of the death of organisms, gradual burial, pressure build-up, liquefaction, and carbon atoms rearranging to form oil. A direct increase in the deaths of plants and animals potentially means that there will be more raw materials available for oil formation. Now, if the number of plant and animal deaths increased, this would be a direct impact on the first step in the oil making process. The more plants and animals that die, the more organic material there is to eventually transform into oil, considering other conditions necessary for oil formation remain constant. This, however, is contingent on the assumption that these increased deaths occur in regions where organic material has the chance to be trapped and preserved in the manner needed for oil formation, that is, get buried under layers of soil and sediment before they are decomposed, and subjected to the right amounts of pressure and heat to trigger the transformation process. The key to oil formation isn't purely about how many plants and animals die, but also about the specific conditions that are required for their transformation into oil. Notably, it involves particular environmental conditions, a certain sequence of geological events, and occurs over an immensely long timescale—a process that started millions of years ago is still ongoing today. Given that the question asks for a \\"supposed perturbation\\", it's reasonable to consider the increase in plant and animal deaths as directly impacting the first step of the oil-making process. However, such a change would not simply equate to more oil production because there are several other factors involved in this complex, lengthy geological process ranging from the burial and preservation of these organic materials, to the type of sediment, to the precise temperature and pressure conditions required.  So, a direct increase in the quantity of dying organic material could potentially influence the oil making process, but this would not automatically translate into an increase in oil. Thus, it would be a kind of perturbation that directly impacts a step of the process, particularly the introduction of more organic material needed for the formation of oil, but indirectly impacts the overall output of oil due to the complexity of the conditions required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What year was the river that flows between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range established as a National Natural Landmark?, using the article: The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding.

Question: Given the following context:  During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD.

Zero-hours contracts do not guarantee a minimum number of hours of employment. The ONS recently estimated that 583,000 people, around 2% of the UK workforce, were employed on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2013. It said the data suggested that most workers on such contracts had at least two jobs. What are zero-hours contracts? Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable ruled out a complete ban on the contracts, because they offer employers \\"welcome flexibility\\". Following the release of the ONS figures Mr Cable said it was also clear there had been some abuse of those on zero hour contracts by some less scrupulous employers. \\"Given the current estimates of people on these types of contracts, it is important we take action. That is why I launched a consultation on the issue of exclusivity in zero hours to ensure people are getting a fair deal,\\" he said. \\"Students, older people and people wanting to top up their income want to work flexibly, but we want to make sure they understand their rights and that they are not tied exclusively to one employer. \\"We will be publishing the results of this consultation shortly.\\" Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said zero hours contracts had \\"spread like an epidemic\\" as he promised to crack down on them if his party wins the 2015 general election. The study found that more than 20% of health and social workers are employed on a zero-hours contacts. But zero-hours contracts are rare in financial services, the ONS found. People with zero-hours contracts were disproportionately students, female and under 25 or over 65, the study also found. \\"These patterns may partly reflect the groups most likely to find the flexibility of 'zero-hours contracts' an advantage,\\" the ONS said. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the figures showed the UK jobs market was far more unstable than the government suggested, and urged ministers to crack down on the \\"abuse\\" of zero-hours contracts by employers. \\"Insecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market,\\" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. \\"It is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans. \\"The fact that these contracts have become the norm in tourism, catering and food will be a major concern for the millions of people employed in these industries.\\" ONS said it found evidence of a further 1.3 million contracts where no work was undertaken. It said the total might include: It added some of contracts \\"probably\\" needed to be added to the official 1.4 million estimate, but that it wanted to investigate in more detail. The ONS said it would carry out further research and report later in 2014. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, Britain's main human resources body, estimated last year that employers used about one million zero-hours contracts. Summary:","output":"Zero-hours contracts, which offer employers flexibility but do not guarantee a minimum number of hours for workers, are used by 2% of the UK workforce, with health and social workers being the most impacted and people under 25 or over 65 being disproportionately affected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first statement, \\"A snowboarder soars off a jump upside down at the mountain resort's terrain park,\\" we can infer that the snowboarder is actively participating in snowboarding activities at the terrain park, specifically performing a trick or maneuver that involves being upside down in the air. This implies that the snowboarder is not only awake but is also physically engaged in the activity. The second statement, \\"The snowboarder is sleeping,\\" contradicts the first statement as it suggests that the snowboarder is inactive and not engaged in any physical activity. Sleep is a state of rest and recovery, where the individual is usually unconscious and non-responsive to stimuli. This is the opposite of the action being described in the first statement. There is no logical connection between these two statements. It is possible for a snowboarder to sleep at some point in time when not engaged in snowboarding activities, but it doesn't follow simply because they are soaring off a jump upside down in the terrain park. The two conditions – performing a snowboarding trick and sleeping – are mutually exclusive and cannot be present simultaneously.

A:","output":"Title: The Whimsical Windmill Genre: Adventure, Comedy, Family Act I: Set in the quaint little town of Windshire, the story begins with Mr. Jones, a kind-hearted and eccentric inventor, beloved by all the town's people. He lives on the outskirts of Windshire in a charming, old windmill that he has converted into his home and workshop. Mr. Jones has dedicated his life to creating unique and outlandish inventions that would make the people of Windshire's lives easier and more enjoyable. However, many of his inventions either malfunction or have unexpected consequences. The town of Windshire, though picturesque and warm, faces a problem that affects everyone - frequent power outages due to its aging power grid. The mayor, a stern and pragmatic woman named Mrs. Brown, announces a town-wide competition for a renewable energy solution. Mr. Jones, excited at the prospect of helping his fellow townspeople, decides to create a one-of-a-kind invention to harness the power of his windmill and generate electricity for the entire town. Act II: Needing assistance in the development of his invention, Mr. Jones enlists the help of Lucy Wells, a bright young engineer who recently returned to Windshire after completing her studies. Together, they work tirelessly to create an energy device that will revolutionize the town's power supply. As they grow closer, Mr. Jones shares his fascinating stories about his previous gadgets and adventures while Lucy grows fond of Mr. Jones's unique and quirky personality. Driven by their shared passion for innovation, they create an invention that uses a series of mirrors and lenses to harness the power of the windmill and the sun to generate electricity. One fateful day, Mr. Jones and Lucy decide to test their invention. The townspeople gather around the windmill, anxiously waiting to see if their power problems will finally be resolved. As Mr. Jones flips the switch to activate the device, an unforeseen mishap occurs - a sudden downpour creates a slippery patch of mud near the windmill. Act III: While trying to adjust the machine's settings, Mr. Jones slips and accidentally fires a focused beam of solar energy at the windmill, causing it to explode in a burst of colors and a whirlwind of confetti. The unforeseen explosion is a result of Mr. Jones's earlier experiment with non-lethal fireworks. Though initially disappointed and embarrassed by the unexpected outcome, the townspeople begin to laugh and celebrate the whimsical explosion. At the same time, the force of the explosion inadvertently flips the switch on another one of Mr. Jones's inventions - a backup power generator that utilizes a new energy source discovered during their work on the windmill project. The generator starts working flawlessly, and Windshire's power problems are solved at last. The people of Windshire applaud Mr. Jones and Lucy for their dedication and congratulate them on their success. Mrs. Brown, moved by the incident and the genuine happiness of the townspeople, realizes the importance of Mr. Jones's creative spirit and the unity of the community fostered by his brilliant mind. As the movie ends, Mr. Jones and Lucy begin work on their next big invention for the town, hand in hand, with the support and love of the people of Windshire. The once-doomed windmill becomes a symbol of hope, ingenuity, and the power of unconventional thinking."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who was brutally scourged? Movie plot title: The Passion of the Christ Movie plot: The film opens in Gethsemane during the night as Jesus Christ (Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John (James' brother) sleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. Caiaphas brings Jesus before... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" it is Jesus Christ who was brutally scourged. This takes place after he was arrested by the temple guards, beaten during the journey to the Sanhedrin, condemned to death for blasphemy, and later handed over to Roman soldiers for crucifixion. The scourging scene depicted in the movie portrays the brutal beating and whipping of Jesus by Roman soldiers before his crucifixion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: remain independent next, create a plan, be flexible next Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze each possible answer step-by-step and in relation to the context provided: 1. Remain independent next: Since Riley has already defied orders and followed her own plan, this option seems like a natural continuation of her behavior. Riley may want to continue making her own decisions and being self-reliant. 2. Create a plan: This option is also plausible. Defying orders implies that Riley already had an alternative idea or plan in mind. After following her own plan, Riley might want to create a new plan or further develop her current one to achieve her goals. 3. Be flexible next: This option might not align as closely with Riley's established behavior of defying orders and following her own plan. Being flexible usually involves adapting to new situations and considering other perspectives or plans. Although possible, it doesn't seem to be the strongest option given the context.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Passage: The tercentenary was kicked off in Imperial Capital St. Petersburg on a rainy February morning. The event had been on everyones' lips for several weeks leading up the actual date, and dignitaries from the whole of the Empire had gathered in the capital's grand hotels: princes from the Baltic and Poland, high-priests from Armenia and Georgia in the Caucasus, and mullahs and tribal chiefs from Central Asia alongside the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bukhara. Additionally there was a large group of visitors from the provinces and workers, which left the usual well-dressed promenaders of the Winter Palace outnumbered. The city was bustling with these visitors, and Nevsky Prospect experienced the worst traffic jams in history, due to the converging of cars, carriages and trams. The streets themselves were decorated in the Imperial colors of blue, red and white, statues were dressed up with ribbons and garlands, and portraits of the line of Tsars going all the way back to the Romanov dynasty's founder Michael were hung up on the facades of banks and stores. Over tram lines were chains of light hung up, which spelled out 'God Save the Tsar' or portrayed the Romanov double-headed eagle with '1613–1913' spelled out underneath it. For many of the provincial visitors this was their first sight of electric light, and they stood in wonder of the 'columns, arcs and obelisks of light'.

Daniel Sturridge likely to miss Liverpool's next six fixtures. Brendan Rodgers confirms striker will be out for 'two to four weeks' Liverpool face Real Madrid on Wednesday and again on November 4. Two own-goals help Liverpool beat QPR 3-2 at Loftus Road on Sunday. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Daniel Sturridge Set to Miss Crucial Liverpool Fixtures, Including Real Madrid Clashes Liverpool's attacking force will be significantly weakened in their upcoming fixtures, with Daniel Sturridge set to be side-lined for the next two to four weeks due to injury. Brendan Rodgers confirmed the news recently, putting additional pressure on the team as they prepare for challenging matches, including two against Real Madrid in the Champions League. The English striker's absence will be a significant blow to Liverpool, who have struggled to find consistent form this season. Sturridge has been dealing with a lingering injury that has kept him out of the squad for the majority of the 2014-15 campaign. His goal-scoring prowess was key to Liverpool's success last season, and the team needs him now more than ever as they aim to maintain their place in the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool's upcoming schedule is particularly daunting, with the team set to face the reigning Champions League winners, Real Madrid, in back-to-back matches. The first encounter will take place on Wednesday, followed by a rematch on November 4th at Anfield. Without the services of Sturridge, Liverpool will have to rely heavily on the likes of Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling to provide the much-needed firepower up front. The Reds were fortunate to secure a 3-2 victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Sunday, with two own-goals from the home team helping to decide the final outcome. Despite this victory, however, Liverpool's lack of synergy and cohesion in the attacking third has been apparent and is a cause for concern as they prepare for their upcoming fixtures. In addition to the clashes against Real Madrid, Liverpool will also be facing Hull City, Swansea City, and Newcastle United during Sturridge's absence. With a string of difficult matches ahead, Brendan Rodgers will need to find a solution to the team's attacking woes to ensure they remain competitive in both domestic and European competitions. The next few weeks will prove crucial for Liverpool as they look to improve their performances on the field and overcome the setback of being without their star forward. Fans and players alike are surely hoping that Sturridge's recovery is swift and that he will be able to return to action soon, to bolster their chances of success in a challenging season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: A). no B). yes","output":"To answer the first question, I will consider several highly acclaimed movies released between 2010 and 2014 and choose the best one based on various factors, such as critical reviews, audience reception, and overall impact on the film industry.

It also achieved great box office success. - The Social Network, The King's Speech, Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Gravity, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Whiplash all received stellar reviews and had significant cultural impact, but their genre and commercial appeal varied. - The Avengers was a massive blockbuster and played a key role in redefining the superhero movie landscape. Step 3: Choose the best Hollywood movie released between 2010 and 2014 Considering the overall impact on the industry and the exceptional blend of storytelling, visuals, and thought-provoking ideas, I pick Inception as the best Hollywood movie released between 2010 and 2014.

One day, Lucy needed to go to another place far away from her kids. She did this because it was the best thing for her and her kids. But not everyone understood this, and some people said mean things about Lucy. They didn't know that Lucy still loves her kids very much. When Lucy went away, she missed her kids a lot. She would call them and talk to them on the phone. She would send them presents and surprise them with fun toys and things to remind them that she's still their mommy and is thinking of them. And when she could, she would visit her kids to give them hugs and kisses. Sometimes, people were unkind and made Lucy feel bad for being so far away from her kids. It hurt her heart, but she knew she's still a good mommy. She knew it was important to be strong for her kids and teach them that even though the family is apart, their love for each other was much stronger. The kids knew mommy was doing her best for them. They missed her and wished she could be with them all the time. They were happy when they talked to her, laughed with her during video calls and they knew that mommy loved them a lot.  But no one is perfect, and even Lucy needed some help. Her friends and family loved her and gave her big hugs and kind words when she felt sad.

In the end, when people said mean things about Lucy, she would remember all the happy times with her kids and the love she has for them. She knew that nothing could ever change that, no matter how far away she was. So, even if mommies and daddies sometimes live far away from their kids, they still love them with all their hearts.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut.

The Christophe de Margerie completed the journey from Hammerfest in Norway to Boryeong in South Korea in only 19 days, the Guardian reported.      In doing so it was able to complete the journey 30 per cent faster than travelling via the Suez Canal, the alternative route.      Even though the £234 million tanker does have its own inbuilt icebreaker, in the past it has been impossible for tankers to undertake the journey without a separate escort.      The integral icebreaker enabled the tanker to get through the northern sea section of the Russian Arctic in only six and a half days, setting a new record.      “It’s very quick, particularly as there was no icebreaker escort which previously there had been in journeys,” said Bill Spears, spokesman for the shipping company which owns the tanker, Sovcomflot.      “It’s very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round.”      While the rapid journey time is in part due to the innovative technology, it also illustrates the extent to which climate change has melted some of the ice.      Earlier this year it was reported that \\"polar heatwaves\\" had shrunk the icecaps down to an all-time low. ||||| Climate change has thawed Arctic enough for 300m gas tanker to travel at record speed through northern sea route      A Russian tanker has travelled through the northern sea route in record speed and without an icebreaker escort for the first time, highlighting how climate change is opening up the high Arctic.      The 300m (£233m) Christophe de Margerie carried a cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Hammerfest in Norway to Boryeong in South Korea in 19 days, about 30% quicker than the conventional southern shipping route through the Suez Canal.      The tanker was built to take advantage of the diminishing Arctic sea ice and deliver gas from a new 27m facility on the Yamal Peninsula, the biggest Arctic LNG project so far which has been championed by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.      Murmansk's silver lining: Arctic city expects renaissance with ice melt Read more      On its maiden voyage, the innovative tanker used its integral icebreaker to cross ice fields 1.2m thick, passing along the northern sea section of the route in the Russian Arctic in a record six-and-a-half days.            “It’s very quick, particularly as there was no icebreaker escort which previously there had been in journeys,” said Bill Spears, spokesperson for Sovcomflot, the shipping company which owns the tanker. “It’s very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round.”      Environmentalists have expressed concern over the risks of increased ship traffic in the pristine Arctic but Sovcomflot stressed the tanker’s green credentials. As well as using conventional fuel, the Christophe de Margerie can be powered by the LNG it is transporting, reducing its sulphur oxide emissions by 90% and nitrous oxide emissions by 80% when powered this way. “This is a significant factor in a fragile ecosystem,” said Spears.            The northern sea route between Siberia and the Pacific is still closed to conventional shipping for much of the year. But the Christophe de Margerie, the first of 15 such tankers expected to be built, extends the navigation window for the northern sea route from four months with an expensive icebreaker to all year round in a westerly direction.      In the route’s busiest year so far, 2013, there were only 15 international crossings but the Russian government predicts that cargo along this route will grow tenfold by 2020. This link with the Pacific reduces its need to sell gas through pipelines to Europe.      “There has been a steady increase in traffic in recent years,” said Spears. “There’s always been trade along this route but it’s been restricted a lot by the ice. It’s exciting that this route presents a much shorter alternative than the Suez route. It’s a major saving.”      Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said that shipping companies were making a “safe bet” in building ships in anticipation that the northern sea route will open up. “Even if we stopped greenhouse emissions tomorrow, the acceleration in the loss of Arctic ice is unlikely to be reversed,” he said.      “We’ve been able to sail through the north-west passage for several years now but the northern passage, which goes past Russia, has opened up on and off since 2010. We’re going to see this route being used more and more by 2020.      “The irony is that one advantage of climate change is that we will probably use less fuel going to the Pacific.”            The extent of Arctic ice fell to a new wintertime low in March this year after freakishly high temperatures in the polar regions, and hit its second lowest summer extent last September. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A Russian gas tanker has traveled through the Arctic without an icebreaker escort for the first time due to climate change, which has melted some of the ice.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia. An 81-year-old woman has been ordered to repay more than 500,000 in falsely claimed Centrelink benefits. Pauline Mitchell has been ordered to repay more than half-a-million dollars in Centrelink benefits she claimed over a 30-year-period on behalf of her dead brother and sister. The 81-year-old from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney,  was ordered to repay the government more than 514,000, which she has received in the names of her dead siblings, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last week. The tribunal is investigating whether Mrs Mitchell, who also goes by her married name Pauline Crowhurst and her mother's maiden name Pauline Henning, will have to repay a further 219,000 based on false reporting of assets to Centrelink. Mrs Mitchell received 292,000 for pensions in the name of her brother Kenneth between 1984 and August 2010, despite the fact he died at sea in 1942 during active service in the Second World War. She also claimed 231,000 in pension benefits for Mary Mitchell, the legal name of her older sister also called Marie or Maria, who died in 1983. Payments to Mrs Mitchell and her deceased siblings were stopped in August 2010 and Australian Federal Police raided Mrs Mitchell's houses at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and in Asquith, in northern Sydney in September 2010. Police found bank account details and key cards for Kenneth and Mary Mitchell. Mrs Mitchell claimed that her brother Kenneth had not died in the war and she met him in a park in the 1980s and saw him again in 2005. She insisted that Mary Mitchell was Kenneth's wife and that she had been withdrawing money from their accounts at their request, which she would leave on a table in the shed for them to collect. Mrs Mitchell has been receiving pensions for her deceased brother since 1984 and for her deceased sister since 1990. Mrs Mitchell was also ruled to have 'told untruths' and deliberately failed to reveal her assets to Centrelink over the last thirty years, failing to tell them about four properties she owned in Kangy Angy on the central coast of NSW, Asquith and Wentworth Falls. At various times over the last few decades she told Centrelink officials that she lived 'in the National Park in the Blue Mountains by a river', in a caravan, and that she was homeless. Senior Member of the AAT Geri Ettinger ruled that 'much of Mrs Mitchell's evidence [was] less than credible' including her claims that she had suffered serious memory loss after being thrown from a horse in 1994. Mrs Mitchell also claimed that she did not tell Centrelink about her living arrangements because her three daughters had been abducted from her in 1968, after she separated from her husband and she 'lived in fear' of a second abduction. She also said that she had moved from her home in Asquith because there was a prostitute living downstairs. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"An 81-year-old lady, Pauline Mitchell, has been told to give back more than 500,000.

America was pioneered much earlier than the 19th century mentioned in the given answer. The actual period of American pioneering began with the arrival of European settlers in the early 17th century, followed by the establishment of settlements along the east coast of what is now the United States. Over time, the continent was progressively colonized, and exploration and settlement took place throughout different periods in history.  While it is true that the 19th-century expansion was driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, this does not address the question asked about when America was pioneered. The pioneering process and the colonization of the continent spanned centuries and involved various waves of migration and settlement, starting from the early settlers in the 17th century (such as the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620 and the establishment of the first English colony, Jamestown, in 1607), through the westward migration of the 19th century.

It is bright enough to land a plane in our front yards. I admit that last year my neighbors won, but only because they bought every strand of lights Wal-Mart had before I could get there. Personal competitions are great, but we get a little carried away. I cannot stand to see coaches shout at kids playing sports. Who cares if someone messes up and the other team advances? I'm tired of people competing just to win. It happens not only in sports, but in music competitions, too. People auditioning for chair placement in certain bands can get really unfriendly. This year I did not audition for a certain band, but I went to auditions anyway. This was the first time I actually had the opportunity to comprehend the whole picture. Other times I've been the person who was nervous and anxious. This time, I sat back and observed everyone else. I came to the realization that the people who aren't so good are terrified of the good people, and the good people are scared stiff that the bad people have taken lessons and can now show them up. Unless a person is on the outside looking in, I don't think anyone realizes _ . Maybe competing is human nature, but we shouldn't let it influence our judgment. Being disrespectful to opponents , letting competition become our life, and becoming so involved that we close ourselves off from friends and family is not the meaning of competition. A little competition is healthy, so it shouldn't hurt anyone. If it does, someone somewhere needs to back off, find the good thing hidden inside, and try it again....

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

The New York Times But the ceremony also reflected something of the spirit of entrepreneurship now reawakening in Nablus, a city of about 150,000 people that was once considered the commercial center of the West Bank. The wedding was the brainchild of Muhannad Rabi, 37, the manager of a real estate development and investment company in the city, the fourth public event he has arranged. “I want to market Nablus,” Mr. Rabi said. Struggling to make himself heard above the cheering audience and the singer belting out Arabic wedding favorites, Mr. Rabi said he started a year ago with a festival at which residents baked what he said was the world’s biggest knafeh, a sweet local pastry. A marathon was next, then a soccer match between authority politicians and residents. He took his idea for a communal wedding to the Palestinian Authority governor of the district, who approved it and brought in the mayor. Mr. Rabi said he wanted to “convey a message to the world that we in Nablus, and Palestine in general, can live as human beings, enjoy life and achieve our political goals.” For years after the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, Nablus was ruled by rival militias and criminal gangs, whose members roamed the streets. Hamas won municipal elections in the city and parliamentary elections across the West Bank and Gaza in 2006. But in June 2007, after the Islamic group seized full control of Gaza, militiamen associated with Mr. Abbas’s Fatah party rampaged through Nablus, looting and burning offices and institutions affiliated with Hamas and storming City Hall. That same year, the Palestinian Authority made Nablus the pilot for its law-and-order program, deploying hundreds of newly trained Palestinian police officers in the city. Palestinian officials said at the time that they wanted to deal first with the “head of the snake.” Now some of the Israeli checkpoints that used to surround the city have been removed, while others are run in a relaxed fashion, if they are staffed at all. The city is open to visitors from all over the West Bank, as well as to Arabs from Israel. In the streets, new cars, including sport utility vehicles, point to growing prosperity. The Nablus Muqata, the authority headquarters destroyed by the Israelis during the second intifada, is being rebuilt. The new mood is personified by people like Atallah and Khamis al-Sairafi, 49, identical twins and entrepreneurs who were born to refugees from Jaffa, now in Israel, and grew up in the Askar refugee camp on the edge of Nablus. A somewhat comical pair — they say they wake up in their separate homes and telepathically end up wearing identical outfits — they started out in the scrap metal business. But just before the second intifada, they bought a disused Boeing 707 passenger jet and parked it in an amusement park they had built along a road east of the city. They had planned to turn it into a restaurant. After the violence broke out, the amusement park became a makeshift Israeli Army camp, and the plane sat corroding next to a derelict Ferris wheel, birds flapping in and out of its broken windows and doors. Now the Sairafi brothers say they are negotiating with the Nablus municipality to move the plane to a new park in the city, on the peak of Mount Ebal. They envision tables inside for more than a hundred diners, and singers performing on the wings. In the meantime they have opened a garbage recycling plant that they say is the “first in Palestine.” Even in the city’s Balata refugee camp, once an infamous hotbed of militancy, there are signs of change. The camp’s 25,000 residents were given a questionnaire by Fatah asking them to rank the projects they most wanted to see built. Their first choice, a public garden, opened early this year. The issue of improvement in the refugee camps has always been a delicate one. The Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants are careful about impressions of permanence, sticking to their demand for a right of return to their former homes in what is now Israel. But Ahmad Douqan, leader of the camp’s committee, said the refugees “never refused offers of help.” “Being a refugee does not mean that I should live with unpaved roads and sewage running in the streets,” Mr. Douqan said. The authority has also approved a major electricity project for Balata, and Mr. Douqan said the government wanted to help build the camp’s first wedding hall, to make marriage more affordable. For the 47 couples at the communal wedding, finance was also a major factor. The city still has many poor residents, and a wedding can cost about 5,000. As well as the party in the amphitheater, the organizers paid for the wedding dresses and a three-day honeymoon in the Jordanian resort of Aqaba, and gave the couples gifts of furniture and cash. Amid the dancing and fireworks, there were reminders of the more turbulent past. The youngest groom, Mufid al-Aqad, 21, who was marrying his 19-year-old cousin, lost his brother, a militant, in an armed clash with Israeli soldiers in 2004. Mr. Assayes, the sculptor, spent several years in Israeli jails for what he described as “defending my home.” Surveying the scene from the side of the stage, he said he felt proud.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pre-K on the Starting Blocks Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to offer full-day preschool to every New York City 4-year-old hasn’t yet rounded the corner from election slogan to classroom reality. But it’s moving: a public-relations campaign on Friday started blitzing the city with leaflets and emails to drum up support for the tax to pay for it. The mayor has assembled early-education experts to design the program and has been seeking support from legislators. He’s even won a (backhanded) endorsement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said in his State of the State address that he wants universal preschool for the entire state. While Mr. Cuomo seems content with an applause line in a wish list, Mr. de Blasio is on the hook with a deeper commitment. He has said how he will pay for it, how much it will cost and that it will begin late this year. His preschool plan (and a separate after-school program for middle-schoolers) relies on the State Legislature raising income taxes on city residents making 500,000 and above. He calls this a negligible sacrifice for a transformative social good. Even so, its prospects are unclear, given Mr. Cuomo’s recent fervor for cutting taxes. Leaving aside the financing uncertainties, the mayor is on solid pedagogical ground. Full-day prekindergarten is a smart investment in growing minds, preparing children to be skilled learners at a moment when they are primed for it. It’s better to reach them at age 4 rather than fixing their learning problems later. Across the country, lawmakers and educators have embraced the universal preschool movement. President Obama has made a similar case. Mr. de Blasio is making a mainstream argument, though on a bigger scale than anyone else. The city has about 100,000 4-year-olds. Mr. de Blasio wants to reach 68,000 of them: 48,000 new students on top of the 20,000 who have full-day public preschool now. Children in private programs would be able to attend the city’s free classes if they wish. This will be expensive: 340 million a year, plus 190 million for the after-school program. But if the plan is executed halfheartedly, as an underfinanced form of babysitting, it’s not worth doing. (This is why Mr. de Blasio argues for a dedicated tax, saying yearly appropriations battles would leave too much uncertainty about financing, discouraging a full commitment from teachers and staff needed to make the program work.) One challenge will be finding the physical space to teach all these 4-year-olds, either by expanding existing programs or building new ones. This may require Mr. de Blasio to put aside his antipathy to charter schools, many of which would be well-positioned to add preschools, though state law would have to be changed to allow this. Then the city will have to persuade parents to sign up, make sure there is a qualified teaching corps with classes small enough to be effective, and tightly integrate the program with kindergarten through third grade so that 4-year-olds do not lose their momentum. It will have to prepare children well for the rigorous Common Core learning standards that promise to bring their math, science and literacy skills up to international norms. The key, Mr. de Blasio’s aides say, is creating a meaningful, high-quality learning experience as they build to scale. Skeptics may say that the benefits of preschool tend not to last, but that doesn’t have to be true, if done right and sustained by good schooling in later years.

Input: Context: Hambleton is a local government district of North Yorkshire, England. The main town and administrative centre is Northallerton, and includes the market towns and major villages of Bedale, Thirsk, Great Ayton, Stokesley and Easingwold., England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight., Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire., In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish., Newburgh Priory is a large house near Coxwold , North Yorkshire , England . Standing on the site of an Augustinian priory , founded in 1145 , it is a stately home in a rural setting with views to the Kilburn White Horse in the distance . The grounds contain a water garden , walled garden , topiary yews and woodland walks . It was an Augustinian Priory from 1145 providing priests for the surrounding churches in return for gifts of land and money from the rich landowners . It is reputed to be the burial place of Oliver Cromwell whose remains were said to have been taken to Newburgh Priory by his daughter Mary when she married the 2nd Viscount . The house was the country seat for the Bellasis family in the 16th and 17th century . Newburgh used to belong to the Earls of Fauconberg is now the home of Sir George and Lady Wombwell who open the Priory to visitors for guided tours from April to June . It is home to the Magic Loungeabout music festival ., Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000., North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington., The Kilburn White Horse, , is a hill figure cut into the hillside in the North York Moors National Park near Kilburn in North Yorkshire, England.

It is situated 18 miles north of York and is where the Rev. Laurence Sterne wrote \\"A Sentimental Journey\\"., York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions., A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\"., Laurence Sterne (24 November 1713  18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an Anglican clergyman.

Summarize this article: Okay, so you got fired. You got dumped. You injured your leg. Does this mean you should look for a new job, join OkCupid, or start training for a marathon ASAP? Of course not. Give your situation a little bit of time until you feel calm enough to make a rational decision. Obviously, you should start looking for new work sooner than you should start training for a race with an injured leg, but you get the picture. If you try to solve the problem directly after the setback, you're likely to make a decision out of desperation and despair, not from a rational standpoint. Watch the entire first season of The Killing. Take a long walk every day for a week. Don't do anything that would make you wallow or be upset, but clear your mind, do something different, and start to heal. This is another important part of dealing with disappointment. You can't keep thinking that the world is completely unfair, and that what happened to you was completely horrible. Okay, so maybe it was, but it happened, and there's nothing you can do to make it un-happen. It was in the past, and this is your present. And if you want to have a better future, then you have to accept the past for what it was, however unpleasant it may be. Obviously, you need to \\"practice\\" acceptance because it won't happen overnight. Let's say your husband cheated on you -- are you going to \\"accept\\" that overnight? Obviously not, but you can come to a place where thinking about it no longer leaves you feeling completely angry and bitter. Sure, hanging out with Mom or your best friend Mindy might not help you improve your career or find a new place to live, but it can make you feel better about the process. You'll see that you have so many great relationships in your life, and that you have an awesome support system that can help you through it all. Though you don't have to rehash the disappointment with everyone, just having them there will make you feel like you're not so alone with your pain. Don't force yourself into loud social outings if you're not feeling up to it; hang out with your friends and family in low-key settings. The old plan didn't work out for you, did it? That's perfectly okay. Ships have to change courses in the middle of the night all the time to avoid unforeseen obstacles, and so will you. Find a new way to get to that dream career, to find that perfect man, or to make your dream charity come to life. Maybe you've had a setback in your health and won't be able to walk for a few months. Work with a physical therapist to make a plan for success. Take a look at your life in a new way. How can you still follow your dreams, make yourself happy, but move things around? Talk to people who know what they're doing. If you're a teacher who is struggling with your job, talk to the principal. If you're trying to make it as an artist, see if there are other artists in your city who will be willing to offer some insight. Call a family friend who knows something about having to relocate to an unpleasant location for a job. Talk to your mom about what it was like when she went through her divorce. Though every situation is different, getting advice from different people (provided that you trust them), will give you more direction and will make you see that plenty of other people are struggling, too. So you may not become director of the writing program at your small college. But there's a new reading series that opened up and they want you to be in charge. Dash at the opportunity to do something new that can give you experience, help you work with a variety of people, and give you more confidence about achieving your goals. If you only want to do thing A, B, or C, then you'll be turning a blind eye when opportunity Z, the best opportunity of all, struts right by you.  A new person can be a new opportunity, too. Don't close off and hang out with the same circle of friends; a new friend can bring new momentum and energy to your life. Maybe you've only looked for work as a high school teacher and just can't get a break. Why not try something different but related, like teaching community college? It can still be a great opportunity that will give you the experience you need. The Nobel-Prize-winning author, Alice Munro, didn't publish a book until she was 37, Steve Jobs was a college dropout, and Matthew McConaughey cleaned chicken coops before he became a star. Look at the lives of other people who dealt with major disappointments before coming out the other end with more guts and more appreciation for what they have. If success was served up on a silver platter, then it wouldn't be worth the struggle, would it?

Article: Showrooming One of the biggest challenges facing brick-and-mortar retailers  in recent years has been the \\"showrooming\\".Driven by the desire to get the best prices, many shoppers are now visiting brick-and-mortar stores to personally check on products that interest them, only to leave and then buy the items online.The new trend is forcing retailers to find out new ways to keep consumers from leaving their store for cheaper prices online. Recent research found that 40 percent of U.S.shoppers have showroomed previously, with big-box retailers suffering the most.Specifically, the study shows that Best Buy, Walmart and Target are the most likely brick-and-mortar stores to have shoppers test out a product in-store and then purchase it online later, while Amazon is benefiting most from the practice, with nearly 60 percent of shoppers using the online retail giant  most often to make their showrooming purchases. Smartphones have pushed showrooming into the front.Shoppers no longer have to wait until they get home to see if they can find a cheaper price for the products they're considering buying.With smartphones, consumers can now compare virtual prices, at both other brick-and-mortar stores and online ones while still inside a retail store.If they can find what they're seeking for less online, the majority will be seeking the first exit.A recent study showed that 45 percent of customers shopping at brick-and-mortar stores walk out and buy their purchase online for a discount of as little as 2.5 percent. This puts pressure on retailers to provide both an in-store experience worth staying for and an online presence that can attract shoppers who are showrooming in other businesses. To cut down on showrooming, many retailers are adopting new methods to keep shoppers in their stores.Among the steps they're taking are price-matching guarantees that allow shoppers to pay a discounted price if they find it cheaper online.This ensures that even a showrooming shopper can make the purchase in the store--regardless of whether...

The kangaroo hopped over the truck.","output":"The sentence \\"The kangaroo hopped over the truck.\\" is indeed linguistically acceptable. In this analysis, I will break down various components of the sentence to explain why it meets the criteria for a well-formed and understandable linguistic structure. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules in a language for the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. In this sentence, the structure follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) format of English sentences. The subject is the kangaroo, the verb is hopped, and the object is the truck. This proper structure allows for a clear understanding of the intended meaning. 2. Morphology: Morphology is the aspect of language pertaining to the forms of words. The words used in this sentence are morphologically sound, as they are all recognizable and correctly formed according to English morphological rules. The noun \\"kangaroo\\" is in its singular form, the verb \\"hopped\\" is in its simple past tense, and the nouns \\"the\\" and \\"truck\\" are in their standard forms. 3. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In this sentence, the meaning is clear and can be easily understood by readers or listeners. The sentence presents a scenario where a kangaroo is hopping over a truck. The action (hopping) performed by the kangaroo (the subject) is directed towards the truck (the object), creating a clear relationship between the action and the object involved in the action. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is the study of how context contributes to the interpretation and understanding of meaning in language. The given sentence does not provide extensive context, but its meaning can still be inferred. For those familiar with kangaroos and their ability to hop, the sentence is plausible. Kangaroos are known for their exceptional jumping abilities, so it is not unreasonable to imagine a situation where a kangaroo could hop over a truck, although it might be an extraordinary event. 5. Vocabulary: The vocabulary used in the sentence is standard English. Each word is understandable and conveys the intended meaning. The sentence does not include any jargon, slang, or obscure words that might hinder comprehension. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The kangaroo hopped over the truck.\\" is linguistically acceptable. It follows the syntactic rules and structure of the English language, the words are morphologically well-formed, the meaning is clear, the context is understandable, and the vocabulary is standard English. While it might be an unusual or extraordinary event, it is linguistically sound and conveys a clear message to its audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

OK... this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike (although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film-makers, and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics) so I wanted to sit in Guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it. The film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is. This has been described many times as as making the film \\"inaccessible\\" to the viewer. The film's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle (or not so subtle) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory, IE. Ray Liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words \\"fear me\\" is portrayed as both tragically pathetic (from Statham's POV) or interrogating and bold (from Liotta's POV). This is but one example of Ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with Revolver, we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal (the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption... I mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys, all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs) but then Guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points. Take the scene where Jason Statham's character runs afoul of a car. This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever... but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death. So the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling, I'd be taking the p*ss if I said I didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going \\"uh... wtf?\\"... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art. It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand. And even easier to say \\"well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film!\\". In my humble opinion, Revolver is a stylish, complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers. If we choose this opportunity to collectively say \\"Ah sh*t, I wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in-nit loll... Guy Ritchie is a tit!\\" then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow, crappy people. Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being \\"pretentious\\". Funny people can be thoughtful too. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer recognizes the complexity and non-linear chronology of the film, and appreciates Guy Ritchie's mature approach to filmmaking in Revolver. They acknowledge that the film may be difficult to understand but argue that this shouldn't be a reason to disregard it. Instead, they praise Revolver as a stylish, complex, and mature piece of modern art. While they mention some confusion during the final act of the movie, they emphasize the importance of not dismissing the film because of its challenging nature. Overall, the reviewer expresses support for Guy Ritchie and his decision to venture into a different, more philosophical realm with this film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lead vocals for this track was primarily performed by Grace Slick, who was the band's lead singer and songwriter. This song was a part of the 1967 album 'Surrealistic Pillow,' which is often recognized as one of the key records from the Summer of Love and the burgeoning counterculture movement of the 1960s. Grace Slick was a pivotal member of Jefferson Airplane, joining the band in 1966 and staying with them until 1972, before continuing with several other iterations of the band such as Jefferson Starship and Starship. Known for her strong and evocative vocals as well as her songwriting abilities, Slick played a key role in defining the psychedelic rock sound that Jefferson Airplane came to be associated with. She was particularly well-known for her meaningful lyricism, and \\"Don't You Want Somebody to Love\\" was no exception. It was a defining song of the countercultural era, with lyrics that spoke to the yearning for human connection amidst the social and political upheaval of the times. The song is characterized by Slick's powerful and bluesy vocals, as well as vivid, layered instrumentals featuring ripping guitar lines, haunting organ, and heavy, steady percussion. It has been considered a highlight of Jefferson Airplane's career and an iconic anthem of the 1960s, stirring listeners with its impassioned plea for love and understanding during a turbulent era in history.+"},{"instruction":"Q: The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful what?

Input: By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The projection is included in a 'skills barometer' it produced for Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning. Significant manufacturing job losses were announced over the last few days, including a Michelin factory closure. However, the centre expects the sector to add between 8,000 and 14,000 jobs by 2025. 'Skills shortages' Under the 'high growth' scenario, that would mean manufacturing jobs increasing by 16%. By contrast jobs in the sector fell by 21% between 1997 and 2007. The centre said growth will typically come in higher value manufacturing \\"driven by an increase in foreign direct investment\\". The report also looks at where there are likely to be skills shortages under the high growth scenario. It points to a \\"significant undersupply\\" of skilled graduates in engineering, maths, computer science and physical sciences. It also forecasts a significant shortage of non-graduates with engineering, manufacturing and science skills. The report cautions that a skills oversupply issue could arise if there is weak economic growth 'Work experience' However, it said that outcome is preferred to a shortage of skills which could constrain economic growth and result in higher levels of unemployment. An oversupply is forecast of graduates with qualifications in psychology and social work. The report makes a number of policy recommendations, including a greater focus on employability skills and more work experience for undergraduates. It also suggests that further education colleges provide too wide a range of services. It states that they could focus on \\"mid to high-level skills\\" with other providers delivering low-level skills training.

Please answer this question: \\"The 1987 record \\"\\"La Bamba\\"\\" was by which artist?\\"","output":"The 1987 record \\"La Bamba\\" is by the artist Los Lobos, an American rock band from East Los Angeles, California. Los Lobos, which means \\"The Wolves\\" in Spanish, was formed in 1973. The group originally consisted of vocalists and guitarists David Hidalgo and Louie Pérez, bassist and vocalist Conrad Lozano, and drummer and vocalist Cesar Rosas. Later on, saxophonist and keyboardist Steve Berlin joined the lineup. Los Lobos rose to fame with their major-label debut album \\"How Will the Wolf Survive?\\" in 1984. Although they had already released an independent album in 1978, their more polished sound in the 1984 album attracted widespread attention and critical acclaim. Nevertheless, it was their interpretation of the traditional Mexican folk song \\"La Bamba\\" that would bring them global recognition. In 1987, Los Lobos was approached to contribute to the soundtrack of the biographical film \\"La Bamba,\\" which was based on the life of Ritchie Valens, a Mexican-American rock-and-roll pioneer who died tragically in a plane crash at the age of 17. Valens had released his own version of \\"La Bamba\\" in 1958, which was a hit that helped popularize Latin American music in the United States. Los Lobos's rendition of \\"La Bamba\\" captured the spirit of Valens's recording by combining elements of rock, Tex-Mex, and traditional Mexican music. The Los Lobos version features an upbeat tempo, complete with infectious guitar riffs and a lively accordion backing, which adds an authentic Mexican touch to the song. This cover of \\"La Bamba\\" was an enormous hit, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, the UK Singles Chart, and various charts around the world, solidifying its place as an iconic pop culture moment. The Los Lobos version garnered numerous awards and accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Los Lobos's success with \\"La Bamba\\" helped to highlight the contributions of Mexican-American musicians to the overall American music scene. However, the band did not want to be pigeonholed as just a Latin rock group. Over their long career, Los Lobos has consistently experimented with various musical genres, including blues, rock, R&B, and traditional Mexican music, with influences from many world cultures. Their willingness to explore diverse sonic realms, while constantly challenging and evolving, has earned Los Lobos respect and admiration from fans and fellow musicians alike. To sum up, the 1987 record \\"La Bamba\\" is by Los Lobos, a versatile and highly acclaimed American rock band that played a significant role in elevating Latin American music within the broader US musical landscape. The widespread success of their rendition of Ritchie Valens's \\"La Bamba\\" can be attributed to its infectious rhythm, lively instrumentation, and heartfelt tribute to a pioneering Mexican-American musician."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – When Dara-Lynn Weiss wrote in Vogue about her yearlong struggle to help her clinically obese 7-year-old daughter lose 16 pounds, she probably wasn't expecting quite the level of backlash that has ensued. Yahoo has highlights from Weiss's article, including her admission that she herself has struggled with eating and body image issues her entire life. Among the tactics Weiss used with daughter Bea: depriving her of dinner because she ate 800 calories at school during \\"French Heritage Day,\\" refusing to allow her to participate in \\"Pizza Fridays\\" because she once added a corn salad on the side, and angrily dumping out her Starbucks hot chocolate when the barista couldn't tell her exactly how many calories it contained.

Imagine if one day, your mom stops you from having your favorite ice cream because she thinks it's not good for you. That's what happened with a little girl named Bea. One day, her mommy, Dara-Lynn Weiss, wrote a story in a very big magazine called Vogue about how hard she worked for a whole year to help Bea, who was a bit too heavy for her age, lose 16 pounds. That's like the weight of around 60 to 80 toy cars! Bea's mommy didn't just stop her from having ice cream, she also didn't let Bea eat dinner one day because Bea had eaten a lot during a school day called \\"French Heritage Day\\". And she didn't let her enjoy \\"Pizza Fridays\\" - which is like a special day when kids can eat yummy pizzas at school - because Bea had a corn salad too. Once, Bea’s mommy even emptied her Starbucks hot chocolate because the person who made it couldn’t tell her mommy exactly how many calories it had.  However, not everyone thought Bea's mommy was right. A lady named Katie Baker wrote on a website called Jezebel about how she thought Bea's mommy wasn't very nice to her own child. Katie felt that Bea's mommy was like one of the meanest women in the world. Dhani Mau on Fashionista.com said Bea's mommy might not seem very normal or reasonable to people who were reading her story. He was not very happy when Bea’s mom stopped her from eating a dish called salad nicoise, like how you might feel if someone came between you and your favorite toy. Another mommy, who chose to have her identity hidden, thought Bea's mommy was harsh because she didn't try to figure out why Bea was eating a lot. Instead, she felt Bea's mommy was unkindly putting her own unhappiness about her body onto Bea. She thought Bea's mommy had shown Bea a direction which might lead her to develop unhealthy ways of thinking about food and body weight when she grows up. So, in a nutshell, Bea's mommy wrote a story about helping Bea lose weight but many people felt she wasn't very nice or fair with her daughter, and they were worried that Bea might feel unhappy or scared about eating food in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: CONTEXT: 25 de noviembre de 2010 En reacción a las presiones ejercidas por la Unión Europea (UE) sobre Suiza, un comité de la Suiza alemana lanzó esta semana una iniciativa popular que demanda el congelamiento de las negociaciones para la adhesión del país, exigiendo que dicha adhesión no ocurra, por lo menos, en los próximos 10 años. El comité ahora tendrá 18 meses para recoger las 100.000 firmas necesarias para presentar el proyecto. Los miembros del comité se presentaron el martes ante la prensa. Compuesto únicamente de miembros alemanes del Partido Liberal Radical (PLR) y la Unión Democrática del Centro (UDC), el comité, que se define como \\"políticamente independiente\\", es dirigido por el diputado del Cantón de Zúrich, Hans-Peter Portmann. Los miembros del comité manifestaron durante la conferencia de prensa que habían lanzado esta iniciativa luego de declaraciones de la UE –según las cuales los acuerdos bilaterales no tendrían futuro alguno–, y de presiones y \\"medidas discriminatorias\\" tomadas, según explicó Portmann, por ciertos países de la UE, \\"entre ellos Italia, con el propósito de lograr poco a poco una adhesión de facto de Suiza a la Unión Europea\\". Así, el comité se opone a la transferencia automática del acervo comunitario exigido por las autoridades políticas europeas. Agregaron, asimismo, que la iniciativa tiene un doble propósito: presionar al Consejo Federal Suizo para que se oponga a todo nuevo acuerdo que acerque a Suiza a la UE, pero también lograr que los partidos políticos de derecho a tomen cartas en el asunto, a los cuales acusó de oponerse \\"la adhesión pero que aún deben probar que su oposición no se reduce a palabras vacías\\". A pesar de la falta de apoyo de grandes organizaciones, los iniciantes confían en que reunirán las 100.000 firmas necesarias para presentar la iniciativa, tarea para la cual tienen tiempo hasta el 23 de mayo de 2012. Cuentan, en efecto, con que el tema de la relación entre Suiza y la UE será forzosamente abordado durante las elecciones federales de 2011. La hazaña no será fácil, sin embargo, dada la negativa expresa del resto del PLR y de la UDC de sostener el proyecto: mientras que el primero considera la iniciativa como \\"inútil\\" vista la moratoria de facto sobre el proyecto, el segundo considera que es sólo una operación publicitaria \\"de los radicales de Zúrich para recuperar a los oponentes a la adhesión de la UE\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  But I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.  What is an answer for this question: Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bottle B would be coagulated. In this situation, Dan has collected three bottles of milk: bottle A and bottle B, which contain pasteurized milk, and bottle C, which contains raw milk. He made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk, keeping the milk in bottle A intact.  Curds are formed when milk is coagulated, which results from adding an acidic substance (such as lemon juice, vinegar, or rennet) or by allowing the milk to sour naturally by introducing lactic acid bacteria. During this coagulation process, the milk proteins, mainly casein, tangle into solid masses, forming curds.  Since Dan made curd out of bottle B milk, it underwent coagulation, forming the curds he desired for his experiment. On the other hand, the milk in bottle A remained pasteurized and intact, without being subjected to the coagulation or curdling process. Therefore, bottle B milk would be coagulated, whereas bottle A milk would remain in its original pasteurized state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But. he added that the protesters must become more. organised and come up with a better programme in order to have a bigger. impact, reported the Chicago Tribune. But in New York, where the protests started last month, the relationship between police and protesters has improved since 700 were arrested for blocking the Brooklyn Bridge two weeks ago and complained of brutal treatment. Meanwhile the protests there have only got stronger, with the added celebrity backing of stars such as singer Kanye West this week. The Occupy Wall Street demonstrators marched to. the home of JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday - and today are gathering at the firm's headquarters in New York to protest. The arrests in Chicago came one day after thousands of people including teachers and religious leaders marched and snarled rush-hour traffic while protesting unemployment and economic woes. Those marches had appeared to target financial events in the city including a conference of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which was also subject to protesters' ire on Tuesday.

Bank of America has not yet commented. Chicago has also seen several weeks of daily protests outside the Federal Reserve Bank by ‘Occupy Chicago,’ an echo of the larger Wall Street protests. Huge cheque: Protestors affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street protests chant outside the home of billionaire David Koch in New York on Tuesday. Placards: People representing Occupy Wall Street and other groups hold a march on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to protest policies they claim favour the super rich in New York. Beginnings: The Occupy Wall Street movement, which is protesting a wide variety of issues and started in September, is continuing in New York and is spreading to other cities around the country. Cardboard signs: Occupy Wall Street protestors stage a 'Millionaires March' in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Meanwhile in Washington D.C., six people were arrested on Tuesday during a protest in a Senate office building involving anti-war and Occupy DC demonstrators, police and participants said. The group unfurled upside-down flags and anti-war banners in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, which houses senators' personal offices and some committee rooms. They chanted ‘We are the 99 per cent’ - reflecting their view that the country's wealthiest one per cent have too much and are too powerful - and ‘Stop the wars’ until Capitol police cleared the area. The protest had been planned for months by such anti-war groups as Veterans for Peace and Code Pink to mark the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan. However the event drew participants as well from the Occupy DC protest, a local version of the anti-corporate Occupy Wall Street demonstrations that have spread nationwide. On the floor: This protestor was one of around 100 arrested early on Tuesday morning after police cracked down on an Occupy Boston camp. Grabbed: These protesters were taken away from a section of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Parkway. Force required: Many of the protesters refused to move from the camp and had to be forcibly removed by cops. Grounded: Protesters are arrested in Boston, after tensions boiled over on Tuesday morning when police arrested about 100 protesters from the Occupy Boston movement after the group expanded its camp. It comes after a huge crackdown on Occupy Boston’s second campsite that saw about 100 protesters arrested and their tents and personal belongings reportedly thrown into bins on Monday night. They were arrested on Monday morning around 1:30am after they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, police said. The protesters, part of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, had tried to expand from their original site in Dewey Square to a second site across the street, along the Rose Kennedy Greenway. A local conservancy group recently planted 150,000 worth of shrubs along the greenway and officials said they were concerned about damage. The arrests were mostly for trespassing. Police had warned protesters for hours they would have to return to Dewey Square, where a tent city has been steadily growing, and issued leaflets saying protesters could not occupy the greenway.

Hypothesis: A man is trying to get his cat out of a tree. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entirely true. The premise provides us with specific details about the man's appearance and the tool he is using, but it does not supply enough information about the object or goal of the man's actions. The hypothesis, which assumes the man is trying to get his cat out of the tree, is just one of many possible explanations that might align with the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need more context or information about the situation. For instance, if we had information such as observing a cat stuck in the tree or the man expressing concern about reaching his cat, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is supported by the evidence. Several alternative scenarios could also fit the given premise: 1. The man might be picking fruits or nuts from the tree using the long pole. This would be a more plausible explanation if the tree is of a fruit-bearing or nut-bearing species. 2. The man could be attempting to remove an unwanted object stuck in the tree, such as a kite or a ball that may have been caught in the branches during play. 3. The man might be performing maintenance, such as pruning or trimming branches to maintain the tree's health or appearance. 4. The man could be trying to knock down a beehive or wasp nest from the tree, either to obtain honey or to address a safety concern surrounding the insects. In conclusion, the premise alone does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. To strengthen the argument, we would require more evidence or context supporting the notion that the man is indeed attempting to rescue his cat from the tree. Multiple alternative scenarios could fit the given premise, so we would need additional information to establish a stronger connection between the premise and the hypothesized situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A racehorse and a horse drawn carriage both depart from a saloon at the same time.  The horse drawn carriage is twenty times slower than the racehorse.  Which will arrive last at the next town? (A) the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town (B) the racehorse will take more time to arrive at the next town A:","output":"(A) the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town Let's examine the context and factors contributing to the difference in the time of arrival between a horse-drawn carriage and a racehorse: 1. Speed: It's stated that the horse drawn carriage is twenty times slower than the racehorse. This implies that if a racehorse covers a certain distance in one unit of time, it will take the horse drawn carriage twenty units of time to cover the same distance. It would mean that the racehorse can move considerably quicker than the horse drawn carriage and thus cover more ground in a lesser amount of time. 2. Efficiency: A racehorse is specifically bred, trained, and conditioned to race at high speeds and cope with the demands of competitive racing. They are built for agility and endurance, allowing them to maintain a faster pace over extended periods. In contrast, the horse or horses pulling a carriage are not specialized for speed and are tasked with hauling the additional weight of the carriage and its passengers or cargo. These factors make it impossible for the horse drawn carriage to keep up with the racehorse in terms of efficiency. 3. Terrain: Even though the terrain may affect both the racehorse and the horse drawn carriage, heavier carriages are more likely to experience difficulty on uneven or challenging landscapes, slowing down their pace even further. A racehorse, being lighter and accustomed to overcoming obstacle courses in competitions, can easily maneuver through complex terrain with less trouble and time required, further widening the gap between the two modes of transport. 4. Rest and maintenance: A racehorse may require less frequent breaks than a horse drawn carriage due to their heightened physical conditioning. Horses used for pulling carriages may require more frequent stops for rest, food, and water due to the energy that is exerted in carrying the additional weight of the carriage. A racehorse can recover from fatigue at a quicker rate than a horse used for casual riding or pulling a carriage, allowing it to maintain a faster pace. Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town compared to the racehorse. The significant difference in speed, efficiency, adaptation to various terrains, and recovery from fatigue between the two makes the racehorse a far superior option in terms of reaching any destination quickly. Consequently, option (A) stating that the horse drawn carriage will take more time to arrive at the next town is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

German: Die Situation serbischer Flüchtlinge, die aus Kroatien, Bosnien und Kosovo stammen, hat in den letzten Jahren erheblich zugenommen, insbesondere in der Region Vojvodina. Infolge der gewaltsamen ethnischen Konflikte und Spannungen, die in den 1990er Jahren in den ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republiken Kroatien, Bosnien und Herzegowina sowie dem später unabhängig gewordenen Kosovo ausgebrochen sind, haben zahlreiche Menschen ihr Zuhause verlassen und Schutz in anderen Teilen Serbiens gesucht. Für eine große Anzahl von ihnen wurde die Vojvodina-Region, die sich im Norden Serbiens befindet, zur neuen Heimat. Die Vojvodina-Region ist geographisch weit entfernt von den Konfliktzonen und hat eine reiche Landwirtschaft und ein multiethnisches Umfeld, was sie zu einem attraktiven Ziel für Flüchtlinge macht. Hier haben viele bosnische Serben, kroatische Serben und Serben aus dem Kosovo Zuflucht gefunden. In vielen Fällen wurden diese Flüchtlinge in den Häusern derjenigen untergebracht, die ihre eigene wirtschaftliche Stabilität nicht mehr gewährleisten konnten. Dies hat jedoch auch einige soziale und wirtschaftliche Herausforderungen für die Vojvodina-Region mit sich gebracht. Einwohner der Region, die älter sind oder Schwierigkeiten haben, ihren Lebensunterhalt zu sichern, sind gezwungen, auf Hilfe von Angehörigen, Freunden oder sozialen Einrichtungen zu vertrauen. Gleichzeitig wird die Nachfrage nach Arbeitsplätzen, Bildungseinrichtungen, medizinischer Versorgung und sozialer Infrastruktur durch die Ankunft der Flüchtlinge erhöht, was den Druck auf lokale Ressourcen erhöht. Integration kann auch für serbische Flüchtlinge eine Herausforderung sein. Obwohl es Sprach- und kulturelle Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen den serbischen Flüchtlingen und der lokalen Bevölkerung gibt, haben die traumatischen Erfahrungen und Unterschiede in der Lebensweise in den verschiedenen ehemaligen jugoslawischen Republiken Barrieren geschaffen, die eine vollständige und harmonische Integration erschweren können. Insgesamt ist die Situation der serbischen Flüchtlinge aus Kroatien, Bosnien und dem Kosovo, die in die Vojvodina-Region gezogen sind, eine komplexe Mischung aus sozialen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Herausforderungen.

Paraphrasing refers to the act of rewording or rephrasing a statement, passage, or text while maintaining the original meaning. It can involve changing the structure, vocabulary, or presentation of the information in order to express the same idea in a different manner.  In this given example, the two sentences express the same core information: A certain individual decided not to participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics due to health concerns related to a particular virus. However, these sentences have been rephrased to present the information differently: 1. In the first sentence, the subject's name is \\"Zika,\\" which seems to be a typo of the intended name \\"Raonic.\\" The second sentence corrects this mistake and uses the correct name, \\"Raonic.\\" The first sentence also uses the incorrect term \\"Raonic virus\\" instead of \\"Zika virus,\\" which the second sentence rectifies. 2. The wordings in both sentences are different. The first sentence starts with \\"Zika decided not to play at the Summer Olympics in 2016\\", while the second one says, \\"Raonic decided not to play in the 2016 Summer Olympics\\". This is a change in the input structure and a reordering of the time reference and event. 3. The way the reason for non-participation is presented differs in both sentences. In the first sentence, the non-participation reason is given as \\"invoking health concerns and the Raonic virus.\\" The second sentence rephrases it as \\"citing health concerns and the Zika virus.\\" Both sentences convey the same idea but use different verb choices (i.e., invoking vs. citing).

The supporting characters include Detective Mike, who reopens cold cases, Sarah - Jessica's adult daughter oblivious to her mother's past, and Karen, a surviving victim of Jessica's past crimes. Step 2: Build the Story Setting The story is generally set in modern times but has flashbacks to the 1970s when Jessica was actively committing her crimes. Step 3: Start the Story The movie opens with Jessica, an aged woman leading a normal life, attending her grandson's school play. Martha, a younger Jessica in flashbacks, revels in her dark activities. The two timelines continue in parallel, slowly revealing Jessica's past. Step 4: The Discovery Detective Mike, who has a penchant for cold cases, stumbles upon unsolved killings from the 1970s. He finds connections between victims that lead to a single, yet unknown, perpetrator. Around the same time, Sarah uncovers some old belongings of Jessica hinting at her sinister past. Step 5: The Confrontation Detective Mike's investigations lead him to Karen, a surviving victim of Jessica's rampage. Karen confirms Jessica was her assaulter. Simultaneously, Sarah confronts Jessica about her discoveries, leaving Jessica panicked.  Step 6: The Arrest Kindling her past persona's ruthlessness, Jessica tries to silence Karen and Sarah to guard her secret, this leads to an additional victim. Step 7: The Climax As Jessica contemplates her escape, Detective Mike and the police corner her.

Option (b) involves skating around the island on the water, but the men are already on a boat with a shuffleboard, so this option isn't relevant to the situation. Option (d) involves pushing around the shuffleboard machine while laughing; however, this doesn't seem like an actual way to enjoy the shuffleboard. Step 3: Choose the most reasonable option. Option (c) involves the men playing shuffleboard with one another and taking turns. This seems like the logical choice because it makes use of the shuffleboard and aligns with the context of the men being on the boat for leisure and entertainment. Step 4: Envision the chosen scenario. The men take turns playing shuffleboard, with one pushing the pucks along the board while the others watch and wait for their turn. They engage in friendly competition and conversation as they enjoy their time together on the boat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Monica hated cleaning the bird droppings off the car unlike Sarah because","output":"Sarah was always fascinated by birds and the beautiful mess they left behind - almost like their personal signature on the world. Monica, on the other hand, found the mess that the birds left on her car to be both irritating and unsanitary. She couldn't understand Sarah's fascination with it, let alone her enjoyment in cleaning the droppings off. Monica's distaste grew with each passing day as more and more birds seemed to make a habit of perching on the sycamore tree above her car. On this particular day, she stepped outside to find her faithful, albeit old, gremlin green compact car absolutely plastered with the stuff - the windshield, the roof, the hood...the whole nine yards. Monica recoiled in disgust, knowing that she would be late to work if she took the time to clean everything off. \\"Why do they always target my car?\\" Monica mumbled under her breath, irritation seeping into her voice. \\"Think of it as a compliment,\\" Sarah piped up cheerily, already running to grab a bucket of water and some cleaning rags. She had been sitting on the porch, sipping on her morning coffee, and watching the birds perform their early feathered ballet in the air above them. \\"Birds are very particular about the places they choose to leave their mark.\\" Monica rolled her eyes, not at all believing that any part of this situation could be construed as a compliment. \\"No, seriously,\\" Sarah continued, coming back with the water and rags, \\"in many cultures, it's considered to be a sign of good luck when a bird leaves its droppings on your head or belongings.\\" Monica begrudgingly joined in the cleaning effort, more so to save time than to indulge Sarah's nonsense. \\"I don't see how this could possibly be considered lucky in any culture,\\" Monica grumbled as she scrubbed at a particularly stubborn stain on the hood. Sarah laughed, \\"Right, but think about it. The odds of being in the right place at the right time to have a bird release its droppings on you, or your car in this case, are astronomically small.\\" \\"That's true, I guess,\\" Monica conceded, still not completely sold on the idea of it being a good omen. She looked at her watch and was dismayed to find that she would be cutting it incredibly close to clock-in time, despite their cleaning efforts. \\"Ugh, I hate being late.\\" Sarah clapped her friend on the shoulder, an understanding smile in her eyes. She fetched her keys and tossed them to Monica. \\"Take my car today,\\" she suggested. \\"It's clean, for the most part. Hurry up and don't be late.\\" Giving in to the inevitable, Monica accepted the keys and handed Sarah her rag, offering a soft appreciative smile. \\"Thanks, Sarah.\\" As Monica drove off to work in Sarah's car, she couldn't help but think about what Sarah had said regarding the birds and their droppings. Maybe there was something to their natural unpredictability that spoke to the deeper, unexplainable mysteries of life. For a moment, she allowed herself to consider that the droppings were somewhat beautiful, even in their chaos. From that day on, Monica still hated cleaning the bird droppings from her car, but perhaps not quite as much as before. There was a begrudging respect for the chaotic nature of the birds and their droppings, and an odd sense of gratitude for friends like Sarah who could find beauty even in the messiest of situations. And with every cleaned stain, Monica found herself growing more and more appreciative of her feathered foes and secretly hoping that their peculiar form of luck would indeed bring her good fortune."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. On October 16, 2015, Usher released an interactive music video exclusively on the music streaming platform Tidal called \\"Chains\\" that featuring artist Nas and Bibi Bourelly. \\"Chains\\" literally forces the viewer to confront the issue of racial profiling and police brutality head-on: By utilizing the webcam on the viewer's computer as well as facial recognition technology, \\"Chains\\" paused mid-song whenever the viewer's eyes deviate from the video. Usher performed the song for the first time at the Tidal X:1020 concert on October 20, 2015, at Brooklyn's Barclays Arena. On January 14, 2016, after continual delays of his eighth album, Usher announced via Daniel Arsham Instagram post that he changed the title of the album from UR to Flawed. It was scheduled to be released in April 2016, but has been pushed back with no release date. On June 9, 2016, Usher released a new single from his expected forthcoming album Flawed on the music streaming platform Tidal titled \\"No Limit\\" featuring Young Thug, along with a second single titled \\"Crash\\" on June 10 for all digital platforms.  On June 12, 2016, it was reported that Raymond signed a management deal with business partner Scooter Braun. Braun already represented Justin Bieber and had a joint venture with Raymond and Bieber. This report was confirmed by Usher during a sit down interview with Ryan Seacrest at the 73rd annual Cannes Festival on June 21, 2016. Usher furthered his acting career, starring as American former professional boxer Sugar Ray Leonard in the 2016 American-Panamanian biographical sports film Hands of Stone about the career of Panamanian former professional boxer Roberto Duran. In it, he starred opposite of Edgar Ramirez, Robert De Niro and Ruben Blades. On August 26, 2016, Hands of Stone premiered worldwide. \\"Missin U\\" was also released as a third single by RCA Records for online streaming and digital download, along with \\"Champions (from the Motion Picture Hands of Stone)\\", both on Vevo. On August 30, \\"Rivals\\" featuring Future was released and debuted exclusively on Tidal with its accompanying video. It was released on Vevo on September 2, 2016. On September 13, 2016, both \\"Missin U\\" and \\"Rivals\\" were sent to radio as the album's third and fourth singles.  The album Hard II Love was released on September 16, 2016, and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. It debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, and sold 28,000 copies in the United States in its first week. It also became his seventh consecutive top ten album in the United States. The lead single, \\"No Limit\\" featuring rapper Young Thug initially was serviced to Urban radio on June 9, and eventually peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him. His father decides it's time he grew up and moved out of the family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment. His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing.  Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity. Bernard's mother also constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence., what would be the answer ?

Having already destroyed the economics of the cosy international airline world, previously dominated by the European airlines, now the gulf carriers seem set to mess up the airline alliances too. All the major European airlines are now part of one of the three big alliances. There is Star (the biggest) based around Lufthansa and United Airlines; Skyteam based around Air France/KLM and Delta; Oneworld based around BA and American Airlines. Read more: How would you save American Airlines? The gulf airlines have until now eschewed the alliances. Firstly because competitively the alliances didn't want them, and secondly because they were growing very nicely, thank you, without them. I predict that","output":"in the coming years, the gulf carriers will continue to disrupt the airline industry, not just by joining one of the three major alliances, but also by potentially forming new collaborations, perhaps even their own alliance. The catalyst for this change will be their continued growth, fueled by their strong financial backing, advantageous geographical location, and expanding fleet of cutting-edge, fuel-efficient aircraft. The gulf carriers, led by the likes of Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have consistently posed a significant challenge to the dominance of the major European and American carriers. With their state-of-the-art aircraft, they have managed to tap into the increasing demand for long-haul travel, offering more convenient connections, superior in-flight service, and competitive pricing. As the gulf carriers continue to expand their reach, it's only a matter of time before they exert considerable influence over the existing alliances or form their own. In fact, this process already seems to be underway. In recent years, the gulf carriers have established a number of strategic partnerships with other airlines, some of which are part of the major alliances. Qatar Airways, for instance, joined Oneworld in 2013 as the first of its kind from the region, signaling a shift in the alliance's strategy. Additionally, Emirates and Etihad have entered into codeshare agreements with numerous carriers that are members of the existing alliances. This speaks to their ability to pursue beneficial collaborations despite not being alliance members themselves. By utilizing these strategic partnerships, the gulf carriers can effectively bypass many of the restrictions imposed by the existing alliances while capitalizing on the benefits of cooperation. This approach poses a significant threat to the alliances, and consequently, to the major European and American carriers. The question then arises: how can the existing alliances and their members adapt to this changing landscape? One possible solution is to forge stronger partnerships among themselves. For instance, imagine a Lufthansa-British Airways joint venture or expanded cooperation between Skyteam and Oneworld members. Another option is to evolve their alliance models to better accommodate and integrate gulf carriers, recognizing the potential opportunities they bring to the table. Furthermore, incumbent airlines will need to up their game by improving their understanding of customer preferences, increasing personalization in services, and optimizing connections and schedules based on customer needs. This will require a focus on emerging technologies and data analytics to remain competitive in the face of growing challenges posed by the gulf carriers. In conclusion, the dynamics of the airline industry are bound to change as the gulf carriers' growth continues unchecked. The disruption caused by these airlines will undoubtedly have lasting consequences on the existing alliances and their members, prompting them to rethink and adapt their strategies in order to remain relevant and profitable. While it is difficult to predict the specific future developments of this ongoing saga, one thing is clear: the gulf carriers are here to stay, and their influence on the international airline scene is only set to grow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cardiff competed in top flight but could only manage a fourth-place finish in 1990-91, and exited the Cup at the quarter-final stage. The season did involve some highlights however, such as beating league runners-up and Cup champions Llanelli 43-0 at the Arms Park and beating league champions Neath 18-4 away in the last game of the season.  1991-92 was possibly the club's worst-ever season, beset with disagreements between coach Alan Phillips and manager John Scott. Cardiff crashed out of the Cup before the quarter-final stage and lost at home to Maesteg and Newbridge in the league. Their final league finish was ninth, which would have led to their relegation but the WRU decided mid-season to switch to a 12-team Premiership, therefore saving Cardiff and Maesteg from relegation. Both Scott and Phillips resigned following the season.  Australian Alex Evans took over at Cardiff as coach for the 1992-93 season, bringing in former Arms Park legend Terry Holmes and famous ex-Pontypool front-row member Charlie Faulkner as assistants, and helped a turnaround in the club's fortunes, winning their first seven matches of the season and 20 of their first 22 to top the league in the new year. This run came to an end on 23 January; they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter's, who were fourth from bottom of Division Four. The Blue and Blacks only lost four league games all season though, but were unlucky to be competing against Llanelli in the league, who won the double and were considered the best club team in the UK after beating Australia 13-9.  In 1993-94 they slid back to fourth in the league but won the SWALEC Cup (renamed from Schweppes Cup for sponsorship reasons) by beating Llanelli, who'd won the tournament for the last three years running. The score in the final was 15-8, with tries from Mike Rayer and club captain centre Mike Hall and kicks from fly-half Adrian Davies. In 1994-95 Cardiff won the final league title of the amateur era in Wales, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Cup before going down 16-9 to Swansea. Answer this question \\"Did they recover from this season?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, they recovered from the difficult 1991-92 season.

Although they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter's, Cardiff only lost four league games throughout the season.

Choices:  - san francisco - refrigerator - gay bar - container - plate  The rationale to choose \\"refrigerator\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The most appropriate answer to the question is \\"refrigerator.\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"refrigerator\\" is that it is designed to preserve food items, like fruits, and maintain their freshness by providing a cool and controlled environment. In the context of the question, the fruit needs to stay fresh despite the heat, and refrigerators are specifically designed for that purpose. The other options provided are not logical choices for preserving the freshness of fruit in hot conditions: - San Francisco: This is a city and cannot be associated with the preservation and maintenance of fruit freshness in the face of heat. - Gay bar: This is a type of establishment where people go for drinks and entertainment. It does not have a direct correlation with preserving the freshness of fruits in the heat. - Container: A container can be used to store fruit, but it doesn't inherently preserve the freshness of the fruit from the heat. A container can be helpful in keeping the fruit clean and organized, but it will not actively cool or maintain the fruit's freshness in hot conditions. - Plate: A plate is a flat dish on which food is served, but it offers no protection from heat or mechanism for keeping fruits fresh. The plate is not an effective option for maintaining the freshness of fruits in hot temperatures.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

Both sentences provide the same information, with a slight variation in the word order, ultimately leading to the same conclusion: Alan Rees married Eleri Morgan in 1975.  In the first sentence, \\"In 1975, the then Alan Rees married Eleri Morgan,\\" the adverb \\"then\\" is used to denote that Alan Rees was unmarried at the time of the event in 1975, and the sentence provides the date, the groom (Alan Rees), and the bride (Eleri Morgan).  In the second sentence, \\"In 1975, the then married Alan Rees Eleri Morgan,\\" the word \\"married\\" acts as the main verb and directly follows the groom's name (Alan Rees), with the bride's name (Eleri Morgan) appearing at the end of the sentence. The overall meaning remains the same, but the word order has been rearranged. In both cases, the message being portrayed is that Alan Rees and Eleri Morgan were wed in 1975.

Question: Who is shy and insecure? Movie plot title: The Witches of Eastwick Movie plot: Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three dissatisfied women living in the picturesque town of Eastwick, Rhode Island. Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees.

Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie's end. As Scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. \\"The Horror,\\" indeed!  However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the \\"before\\" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the \\"after,\\" even though he really shouldn't be. It's what you might call the \\"Doctor Smith\\" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).

By saying this, the reviewer establishes that their dissatisfaction arises from a well-informed perspective rather than a lack of familiarity with the genre. Secondly, the customer specifically criticizes the author, Kathleen Lawless, for her writing style. According to the reviewer, the book mostly contains sex scenes and lacks both plot and romance, which is essential for a satisfying reading experience. It seems that the customer expected a balance between romance and explicit content, but that balance was not found in the work of Kathleen Lawless.

Choices:  - esoteric - categorized - arcane - cerebral - exclusive  The rationale to choose \\"arcane\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The correct answer is \\"arcane.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"arcane\\" as the answer lies in understanding the meaning of the word \\"esoteric\\" and its relationship to the other options provided. Esoteric information refers to knowledge that is intended for a select few and not easily accessible or understood by the general public. It is often associated with specialized or secret knowledge. Arcane has a similar meaning, as it refers to knowledge that is mysterious or understood by only a few. The other options don't fit the context of the question as well: - Categorized simply means organized into categories, which doesn't relate to the idea of information being exclusive or limited to a select group. - Cerebral pertains to intellectual or mental activity, which doesn't directly relate to the exclusivity of knowledge. - Exclusive, while it could be related to restricting access to information, does not have the same connotation as esoteric or arcane when describing knowledge. Since the question implies that the person thought all information should be esoteric in nature, it means they didn't like the idea of knowledge being easily accessible or understood by the general public.

It's a tightly knit community where everyone relies on each other and the caribou for survival. However, strange occurrences and unexplained disappearances of the caribou begin to stir up suspicion and concern among the townspeople. The town's local wildlife conservationist, Dr. Harlow Taylor, discovers an alarming decline in the caribou population. Desperate to save the town and its people from economic collapse, she teams up with Jack, an experienced local tracker, to uncover the reason behind the mysterious caribou disappearances. As they venture deep into the forest, evidence mounts that the caribou are being killed by a pack of unusually aggressive and intelligent wolves. Jack's work requires him to get up close and personal with the wolves, using his tracking skills to study their behavior. With the town's survival at stake, Dr. Taylor and Jack must quell the rising panic among the townspeople, who now perceive the wolves as a genuine threat that needs to be exterminated. Courageous young activist, Sasha, daughter of Dr. Taylor, helps to educate the community about the importance of maintaining a delicate balance between man and nature. Amid animosity and fear, Dr. Taylor discovers a shocking truth – a rogue group of poachers led by a merciless and cunning mastermind, Randall, have been driving the wolves to attack caribou herds. These illegal hunters aim to manipulate the townspeople into killing the wolves, leaving the caribou vulnerable and easy prey, ultimately seizing control of the valuable hunting grounds. In a thrilling and emotional climax, Dr. Taylor, Jack, Sasha, and the locals join forces to expose and confront the poacher gang. Using their knowledge of the wilderness and their strong bond with each other, they outsmart Randall and bring him and his cohorts to justice, thus restoring peace and balance to Ember Valley. As the story reaches its conclusion, the audience is left with a profound message about the need to protect the delicate balance between humans, predators, and prey in the interconnected ecosystem they coexist in. The resilience of the caribou population serves as a symbol of hope and unity for the inhabitants of Ember Valley."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Late Night with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show hosted by Conan O'Brien that aired 2,725 episodes on NBC between 1993 and 2009. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. Late Night aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. The show's house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg, who also served as a sounding board for O'Brien on the show (more so after Andy Richter's departure). The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie \\"LaBamba\\" Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. James Wormworth served as backup drummer when Weinberg went on tour with Bruce Springsteen. With the departure of Andy Richter, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O'Brien's jokes. One common running gag was Max's awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max's lack of knowledge of current affairs.  \\"LaBamba\\" was also used as the butt of many of Conan's jokes. These humorous sketches usually revolved around LaBamba's sizeable mustache, his poor acting skills, and his alleged inability to read written music. Mark Pender would often sing songs on the topic of a current event which ended with him screeching uncontrollably and climbing the risers into the audience. All members of the 7 had successful side careers as studio musicians.  As is common in the talk show format, the Max Weinberg 7 performed the show's opening and closing themes, played bumpers into and out of commercial breaks (they actually played through the entire break for the studio audience), and a short piece during O'Brien's crossover to his desk after his monologue (except for several months beginning in April 2008, where a commercial break was inserted at that point). The show's opening theme was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie (a finalist for the job as band leader). The show's closing theme was called \\"Cornell Knowledge\\", and was lifted from Jerry and Jimmy Vivino's first album together. However, on Late Night, it was played at a much quicker tempo than the album version.  The band played a wide variety of songs as bumpers--usually popular music from a variety of eras. Weinberg sometimes took extended leaves of absence to tour with Bruce Springsteen as the drummer for his E Street Band. During his absence, temporary replacement drummers were hired (most commonly James Wormworth), and the band was led by Jimmy Vivino (\\"Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7\\"). Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Is there anything else interesting you can share from the article?","output":"Yes, there is an interesting aspect mentioned in the article regarding the show's house band, The Max Weinberg 7.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \\"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\\" and that they would accelerate \\"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" Question: We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph    _   . Answer: Answer:","output":"We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph 4. This is because, in Paragraph 4, the author discusses the significant change in 2011 when the Government announced that universities could charge fees of up to £9,000 a year, which had substantial repercussions on students applying for a university place and their financial situations. This change marks the largest increase in tuition fees mentioned in the article and could be considered the \\"biggest change,\\" making it appropriate to place the sentence at the beginning of this paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Don't worry; I'll make it super simple! [i] no. First, let's talk about input and output modules. Imagine you have a toy robot. An input module lets your robot listen and understand your commands, like when you tell it to walk or dance. An output module helps your robot show you what it's doing or thinking, like saying \\"walking\\" when it's walking. Now, let's talk about file input/output with an if-else program in Java. Java is like a secret language that helps your toy robot (computer) understand what you want it to do. You can use Java to read information from files (inputs) and write information into files (outputs). An if-else program lets your robot make decisions based on your commands, like if you say \\"walk\\" it'll walk, otherwise (else) it'll just sit still. The two questions are different because the first one is about input/output modules in general, and the second one is about how to use them in a specific Java program.

Laura being a commando.;","output":"(A). Amy being a commando. From a very young age, Amy always had the mindset and desire of a true commando. Growing up in a military family, she was inspired by the stories of bravery and camaraderie her father, a decorated Marine, would recite to her every night. Amy's commando training began in her early teenage years, which eventually helped her to become a highly efficient and skilled member of an elite Special Forces unit. Laura, on the other hand, was never interested in that sort of thing. She grew up in the quiet suburbs with a loving family that remained far removed from any military adventures. Her life was filled with the simplicity of an average civilian: finishing school, finding a good job, and settling down with the perfect partner. While Laura had her fair share of bold moments and physical skills, she lacked the training, experience, and tactical knowledge that Amy possessed. As a result, it became apparent that when it came to being stealthy, Amy was far better than Laura. Amy's commando training allowed her to move with the grace and agility of a panther, slipping through the shadows unseen. Her advanced night-time navigation skills meant that her targets would often be unaware of her presence until it was far too late. She could traverse the most difficult terrain with ease, scaling walls, and navigating through narrow tunnels – all while remaining quiet as a whisper. Laura, despite her tenacious spirit and determination, just couldn't compare. Her movements were often clumsy and loud, making her presence known to anyone nearby. Even when she tried her best to be stealthy, her lack of experience and understanding of her surroundings made it difficult for her to move without attracting attention. Over time, Laura began to understand and respect the differences between her and Amy, realizing that each had their own strengths and weaknesses. While she could never match Amy's stealth abilities, Laura thrived in other areas – her natural charisma and social adaptability made her adept at reading people and blending in with various environments, turning her into an excellent undercover agent. Though Amy and Laura each had their own specialties, they soon discovered that they complemented each other well, forming a highly effective team in their covert operations. Amy would handle the tasks that required the utmost stealth and precision, while Laura worked her magic in the realm of information-gathering and infiltration. Together, they became an unstoppable force that consistently triumphed over the most fearsome challenges. As their partnership progressed, Amy and Laura forged a deep bond, learning from one another and realizing that teamwork, mutual respect, and understanding were the keys to success in their dangerous line of work. And while Amy may have been the better commando when it came to stealth, both women embodied courage, dedication, and unwavering loyalty – traits that played a crucial role in securing their victories and ensuring the safety of their comrades and nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Turkmenidae is an extinct family of lamprids from the Paleogene of Turkmenistan. They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Oligocene is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present (to ). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"oligos\\", few) and (\\"kainos\\", new), and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs. The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period. The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene. Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands, and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt.  - Analectis pala is an extinct lamprid of the Family Turkmenidae . Its fossils are found from Late Oligocene strata from what is now Turkmenistan . Analectis , as with the other members of Turkmenidae , was a close relative of the opahs .  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Turkmenistan (or  ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west.  - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.  - Opahs (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish (not to be confused with Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: \\"Lampris\\" (from the Greek \\"lamprid-\\", \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus \\"Lampris\\" and the other in the monotypic \\"Megalampris\\", are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.

During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1]  Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.  Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly? The answer to this question is:","output":"Iceland will feel the effects of climate change more quickly. The rationale for this answer is based on the information provided which states that \\"the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world\\". Iceland, being located closer to the North Pole, is at a higher latitude compared to Ecuador, which is near the Equator. Therefore, according to the given information, Iceland will experience the impacts of climate change more rapidly than Ecuador."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change). Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

Question: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack.  \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\"  But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack.  A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.  Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.  The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

How many different ways can it be chosen if it must include 2 of each gender? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, the two questions you asked are not paraphrases of each other; in fact, they're related to entirely different subjects. The first question focuses on a concept in statistical modeling and prediction, while the second question is a combinatorics problem in discrete mathematics. Let's dig a bit deeper into each question: 1. \\"Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?\\" Predictors, also known as independent variables, are the variables in statistical models that the model uses to make predictions on the outcome or dependent variable. Including fewer predictors over many might be preferable due to a number of reasons: - Overfitting: With more predictors, a model can become excessively complex, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the training data. Such an overfitted model will perform poorly when faced with new, unseen data because it is too tailored to the training data. - Collinearity: When you include more predictors in a model, the chances of having high correlation or collinearity between some predictors increases. Collinearity can inflate the variance of the model parameters and make the model's estimates and interpretations unreliable. - Parsimony: The principle of parsimony (also known as Occam's Razor) suggests that the simplest model that fits the data is usually the best. Adding unnecessary predictors complicates the model without adding value. - Interpretability: Models with fewer predictors are usually easier to understand and interpret. They carry clear-cut insights about the relationship between predictors and the outcome variable. - Cost and Efficiency: Collecting data for numerous predictors can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, more predictors require more computational resources. 2. \\"A committee of 4 is chosen from 7 men and 6 women. How many different ways can it be chosen if it must include 2 of each gender?\\" To answer this, we use a concept in combinatorics known as combinations. The number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items (denoted as \\"n choose r\\") is given by nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where \\"!\\" represents factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. In this case, we want to choose 2 men out of 7 and 2 women out of 6. The number of ways to do this would be (7 choose 2) * (6 choose 2).  So, calculate (7 choose 2) which is 7! / [2!(7-2)!] = 21 ways to choose 2 men out of 7.   And calculate (6 choose 2) which is 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15 ways to choose 2 women out of 6. Therefore, there are 21 * 15 = 315 different committees possible with 2 men and 2 women. The first question deals with a common dilemma in statistical modeling—balancing model complexity with prediction accuracy—and the second is a straightforward problem in combinatorics, concerning the number of ways to choose a sub-group from a larger group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
