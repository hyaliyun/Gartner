I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit. That was nearly 50 years ago and it still pisses me off. Question: Why is the sailor still pissed off today?

Which is this about? AP - The NFL will not fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor after looking into allegations that a Cincinnati player was spit on during Sunday's game.","output":"This topic is about the National Football League (NFL) deciding not to fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor following investigations into allegations that he had spat on a Cincinnati player during a game held on Sunday. To provide further context, Sean Taylor was an American professional football player who played as a safety for the Washington Redskins in the NFL. He was known for his aggressive style of play and hard-hitting tackles, which earned him a reputation as one of the most intimidating players in the league. On the particular Sunday in question, the Washington Redskins faced the Cincinnati Bengals in an NFL match. During the course of the game, it was alleged that Taylor had spat on an opposing Cincinnati player, an action that would have been considered unsportsmanlike conduct and a violation of the NFL's rules and regulations. After the incident came to light, the NFL conducted an investigation to determine whether or not the allegations against Taylor were true. This would typically involve interviewing the players involved, reviewing video footage of the game, and consulting referees and other match officials. The objective of the investigation was to gather enough evidence to establish whether or not Taylor's alleged actions had occurred and to assess the appropriate disciplinary measures should the allegations be proven. In this case, the NFL ultimately decided that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim of Taylor spitting on the Cincinnati player, and as a result, opted not to fine him. If they had found him guilty, Taylor could have faced monetary fines, suspensions, or other disciplinary actions, depending on the severity of the offense and its impact on the game. This decision demonstrates the NFL's commitment to enforcing its rules and ensuring sportsmanship among its players, while also recognizing that allegations must be supported by concrete evidence before disciplinary measures are taken. It's worth noting that incidents like these are taken seriously by the NFL, as they work to maintain a high standard of sportsmanship, ethics, and professionalism within the league. Such actions can have a negative impact on the reputation of the league, its players, and the sport as a whole. As such, proper investigations are necessary to ascertain the truth behind any allegations and prevent both unwarranted punishments and potential leniency in ensuring the fair conduct of all players."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left-hand side, we can combine the 'o' terms, which will get us: -335*o - 4002  On the right-hand side, we can add 1421 and 942, which will get us: 2363  So the simplified form of the equation is: -335*o - 4002 = 2363 Next, let's isolate the o term, so we will add 4002 to both sides to get rid of the -4002 on the left-hand side. -335*o = 2363 + 4002 Performing the addition on the right-hand side will give: -335*o = 6365 The final step is to solve for 'o' by dividing both sides by -335 o = 6365 / -335 Calculating the right-hand side will give the value of 'o'.

Here is an article: Alan Boyle, Science Editor NBC News Jan. 2, 2014 at 1:40 PM ET Scientists have undertaken what they say is the most serious search for signs of time travelers at work on the Internet. They came up with no hard evidence — but does that rule out time travel completely? \\"In my mind, it makes it less likely that it's possible,\\" Robert Nemiroff, a physicist at Michigan Technological University, told NBC News. However, he and MTU graduate student Teresa Wilson acknowledge there are lots of reasons why they might miss the hints of information flowing backward in time — ranging from a simple oversight to the influence of a cosmic Chronology Protection Agency. Nemiroff and Wilson lay out their Internet-based experiment in a paper that's been submitted to the ArXiv scientific preprint server, as well as a poster to be presented next week at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Washington. An experiment 'just for fun'Nemiroff said the idea of looking for time travelers arose during one of the poker games he organizes for his students at the university. \\"My summer students and I said, 'Why don't we start looking for this, just for fun?'\\" The idea isn't a new one: For more than a century, science-fiction writers have been exploring the implications of going back and forth in time. In a sense, we're all traveling forward in time — and Einstein's theories of relativity showed that the rate of that forward travel can vary, depending on frames of reference. But backward time travel? Some physicists say that's impossible, due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. There have been a couple of attempts to lure time travelers to high-profile parties. MIT student Amal Dorai tried that in 2005. Famed British physicist Stephen Hawking issued post-dated invitations to a party in 2009. Nobody came. The comet and the popeNemiroff and Wilson tried a different tactic. They looked for signs of foreknowledge about specific events on the Internet, or in Twitter tweets. The two events they chose were the discovery of Comet ISON in September 2012, and the selection of Pope Francis in March 2013. Looking for the evidence was trickier than it might sound: For example, search engines such as Google and Bing can misinterpret time stamps for Web pages, and it's also possible to back-date blog entries or Facebook posts. The researchers found Twitter searches to be the most reliable tools, because tweets can't be back-dated. \\"No clearly prescient content involving 'Comet ISON,' '#cometison,' 'Pope Francis' or \\"#popefrancis' was found from any Twitter tweet — ever,\\" they reported. They also issued a request for time travelers to send tweets using either the hashtag \\"#ICanChangeThePast2\\" or \\"#ICannotChangeThePast2\\" by the end of August 2013. The trick was that the request was issued in September. No such tweets were found that predated the deadline. (Some have been received since, however, including this one from Thursday: \\"Your future laws forbid me from giving you any proof of our technologies. But be sure that we're watching you. #ICanChangeThePast2\\") Nemiroff told NBC News that the time-travel paper was submitted to three journals, but was rejected by all three. \\"At this point, I don't know if it will ever appear in a refereed journal,\\" he said. If there are any time travelers out there who can let him know, he'd appreciate hearing about it. And while you're at it, he'd also appreciate receiving \\"a large sum of money in negotiable currency.\\" Alan Boyle is NBCNews.com's science editor.

Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet.  I am facing a new situation today: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"To analyze the given situation, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. The blood sugar drops in a body. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon. 3. The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose. 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood. 5. The blood sugar levels are restored. Suppose more glucose is produced, possibly leading to a scenario where less regulation of blood sugar level is needed. Let's consider the three different possibilities for how this could be related to the process: - Directly impacting a step of the process: This implies that the increased glucose production affects one of the steps directly. This could mean that the liver is producing more glucose than necessary in response to glucagon (Step 3), or that it releases more glucose into the blood than required (Step 4). - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: This means that the increased glucose production doesn't directly alter a step in the process, but instead influences it through secondary effects. An example might be an increase in insulin sensitivity in target cells, requiring less glucagon production for the same glucose uptake, which in turn influences how the entire process unfolds. - Not impacting any step of the process: In this scenario, the increased glucose production would not affect any step of the process. This could be attributed to factors unrelated to the process mentioned, such as increased dietary sugar intake, or an unrelated condition that affects blood sugar levels without interfering with the process itself. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more glucose being produced while having lower blood sugar regulation would most likely be directly impacting a step of the process, either by causing the liver to produce more glucose (Step 3) or release more glucose into the blood (Step 4)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

A large, antique oven in her kitchen serves as a constant reminder of her past glory and unrecognized talent. Enter Timmy, a cheeky yet charming young boy from the city who was recently sent to stay with his grandmother in the country. Timmy is adventurous, bright, and endlessly curious. He is inescapably drawn to Betty’s house after catching a waft of her pastries' sweet fragrance, and the pair quickly strike up an unlikely friendship.  However, Timmy, unaware of Betty's past, playfully pushes her into her kitchen one day only to witness her having a panic attack near her antique oven. An innocent prank reveals a traumatic chapter in Betty's life. Embarrassed, Betty confesses to him about her dark past- about a terrible kitchen fire while in the height of her career that scarred her physically and emotionally, rendering her frightened of ovens. Feeling sympathetic, yet inspired, Timmy promises to help Betty overcome her fear. He begins with small steps, trying to convince Betty to teach him basic cooking, sticking to stove-top recipes.

To do this, we'll add 42*g to both sides of the equation: -42*g + 42*g = 29*g + 42*g + 568 This simplifies to: 0 = 71*g + 568 Step 2: Isolate the g term. To isolate g, we'll subtract 568 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 568 = 71*g + 568 - 568 This simplifies to: -568 = 71*g Step 3: Solve for g. To find the value of g, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 71: -568 / 71 = (71 * g) / 71 This simplifies to: -8 = g So the value of g is -8."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers.

Please briefly summarize this news article: George Michael jailed for eight weeks Blood tests showed he had chemicals linked to cannabis in his system. The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998. Fans gathered outside the court to get a glimpse of the star, screaming his name and trying to break through a barrier of 12 police officers as he arrived at court this afternoon. One fan passed a good luck card for Michael to Mr Goss. Shelly Williams, 41, from east London, sobbed from the public gallery as Michael was sentenced. \\"I have been a fan for 26 years - that's longer than a marriage. \\"I hope he continues with the process of making himself better.\\"","output":"Singer George Michael has been jailed for eight weeks following a car accident caused by driving under the influence of cannabis.

(CNN) -- A New Zealand court denied bail Wednesday to the founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload, whose extradition is being sought by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Kim Dotcom, who is also known as Kim Schmitz, will remain in custody until at least February 22, when an extradition hearing is to be held, the court said.  U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload last week and announced indictments against Dotcom and six other people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an \\"international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works.\\"  Four of those charged, including Dotcom, were arrested in New Zealand at the request of the U.S. government. The New Zealand police detained Dotcom, a German citizen, on Friday after a raid on his mansion in the North Shore area of Auckland, the country's largest city.  In a packed court on Monday, Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, said that his client is innocent and should be granted bail.  \\"Mr. Dotcom emphatically denies any criminal misconduct or wrongdoing and denies the existence of any 'mega-conspiracy,'\\" Davison told the court.  But New Zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of U.S. authorities, argued that Dotcom's bail request should be denied because he presented an \\"extreme\\" flight risk.

Article: Tesla is losing more money than expected as it nears the launch of its first mass market car.      On Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) reported a loss of 330 million for the first three months of the year, far exceeding Wall Street's estimates and up from 282 million a year earlier.      The larger loss comes even as Tesla reported strong sales for the quarter. It posted revenue of 2.7 billion, more than double from a year earlier, fueled by shipping a record 25,051 cars.      Tesla is spending heavily ahead of the Model 3 launch, which it says is still on track to start production in July.      \\"I don't know anything that would prevent us from starting production in July,\\" Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, said on a conference call with analysts. \\"There may be something that pops up, but I don't know what it is today.\\"      In preparation for the Model 3 launch, Tesla says it's \\"significantly expanding our infrastructure to support Tesla owners,\\" according to a shareholder letter Wednesday.      That includes plans for 100 more retail, delivery and service locations globally as well as opening Tesla's first body repair shops. Tesla also reiterated plans to \\"at least\\" double the number of charging stations.      Related: Tesla just became the most valuable carmaker in America      Tesla says it expects to be able to support production of 5,000 Model 3 cars a week this year and 10,000 a week next year. But the company also admitted to some unpredictability as it gears up for the launch.      \\"Given that we will be ramping Model 3 production so quickly ... even a couple-week shift in timing can have a meaningful impact on total deliveries,\\" the company wrote in its shareholder letter.      Some analysts are sounding a cautionary note about the Model 3.      \\"In this climate of low fuel prices, an administration that favors less stringent environmental controls and a market proliferation of full-electric offerings from mainstream manufacturers, the launch might be a difficult one,\\" Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement.      The Model 3 has already created at least one other unique headache for Tesla: Some customers apparently assume it's an upgrade to the earlier Model S because of its name and are therefore holding off buying the S.      In fact, the Model 3 name doesn't signify a third-generation Tesla. It's a play on \\"sex\\" -- Model S, 3 and X.      \\"I thought we were being all clever by calling it the Model 3,\\" Musk said on the call. \\"But actually the joke's on me because it caused confusion in the marketplace.\\"      Even without the Model 3 on the road yet, Musk teased future vehicles on the call, including a semi-truck and an SUV called the Model Y. On the call, Musk hinted that the Model Y will come by 2020.      Tesla's stock has soared this year on optimism for the Model 3, pushing its market cap to more than 50 billion, above older car companies like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM).      On the call, Musk reiterated his lofty 2015 prediction that Tesla could be worth 700 billion in the next decade. \\"I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\\" Musk said. \\"Of course I could be completely delusional.\\" ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

Input: Context_1 : Per Fine Ounce is the title of an unpublished novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond. It was completed c.1966 and is considered a \\"lost\\" novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. \\"The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½\\", a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond's nephew; \\"Colonel Sun\\" written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming's \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" (1965). Context_2 : The Life of Ian Fleming is a biography of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond and author of the children’s book \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". The biography was written by John Pearson, Fleming’s assistant at the London \\"Sunday Times,\\" in 1966. Pearson later wrote the official, fictional-biography \\"\\" in 1973. \\"The Life of Ian Fleming\\" was one of the first biographies of Ian Fleming and is considered a collectible book by many James Bond fans, since Pearson would become the third, official James Bond author. Context_3 : Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions \\"James Bond\\" film series and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, the film marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. \\"Casino Royale\\" is a reboot of the film series and as such is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami International Airport, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, the treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs to bankrupt a terrorist financier, Le Chiffre, by beating him in a high-stakes poker game. The story arc continues in the following \\"Bond\\" film \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (2008), \\"Skyfall\\" (2012), and \\"Spectre\\" (2015) also feature explicit references to characters and events in this film. Context_4 : Ian Fleming: Where Bond Began was a 2008 documentary presented by Joanna Lumley which explored the life of the author Ian Fleming and the origin of his character James Bond. It was first broadcast on BBC One at 6:10pm on Sunday 19 October 2008 and was commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth and the then forthcoming release of the film \\"Quantum of Solace\\". Context_5 : Felix Leiter is a 2017 comic book miniseries featuring the eponymous character, who is primarily featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and various other formats by several other creators. Written by James Robinson and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, the comic book is a spin-off from the \\"James Bond\\" series published by Dynamite Entertainment, making its debut in January 2017. It also marks the first time for Bond's ally and friend, Felix Leiter to get a solo adventure in any format overall. It is also licensed by Ian Fleming Publications that hold the literary rights to the James Bond franchise. Bond himself makes a cameo appearance in the comic book as part of a flashback. Context_6 : The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel \\"Casino Royale\\"; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all written at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964. Context_7 : Light of My Death is a 1993 spy comic book featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond in the central role of the plot, written by Das Petrou and illustrated by John Watkiss. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in issues #8-11 of \\"Dark Horse Comics\\". It includes the return of a Bond girl from a Fleming novel, Tatiana Romanova from \\"From Russia, with Love\\" (1957). Context_8 : Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty-second spy film in the \\"James Bond\\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Gemma Arterton, Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, a member of the Quantum organisation, who intends to stage a \\"coup d'état\\" in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply. Context_9 : Kissy Suzuki is a fictional character introduced in Ian Fleming's 1964 \\"James Bond\\" novel, \\"You Only Live Twice\\". Despite Bond's womanizing, Kissy Suzuki (at least the literary version) remains the only character known to the reader who bears a child by him. She is also one of the few known Bond girls (also in literature) to have died as a result of a non-violent, natural death (although that death does not occur in the Bond canon, but rather in a short story written by someone other than Ian Fleming). The treatment of Kissy varies greatly between the novel and the film, where she is never identified by her name, no family name appears in the closing credits, and the film ends in the usual Bond-style happy ending. Context_10 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\". She was portrayed by Ursula Andress in the 1967 James Bond parody, which is only slightly based on the novel, and by Eva Green in the 2006 adaptation. fact_1 : Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty-second spy film in the \\"James Bond\\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. fact_2 :  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. fact_3 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\".

I can use this background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision).  Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches.  Answer this question please: In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. We know that an optimal decision maximizes the expected utility, which is a probability-weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision. 2. John is applying the optimal decision-making process, so he will try to maximize the expected utility for decision C by considering the probabilities and utilities associated with its uncertain outcomes. 3. On the other hand, Keith relies on his hunches, meaning he does not follow a systematic process to analyze probabilities and utilities; instead, he makes decisions based on his intuition. 4. Since Keith's strategy does not involve explicitly maximizing expected utility, it is less likely that his approach will consistently lead to maximizing the expected utility compared to John's approach. Therefore, in respect to decision C, Keith's strategy would most likely not maximize the expected utility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Inmates at a jail for teenagers represent 48 different gangs, inspectors have discovered, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI), a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said in a report. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons said in a report (file photo) The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents in the six months before the visit, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, separated from 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said: 'The welcome reduction in the number of boys in custody means that those who remain are a more concentrated mix of very troubled boys who sometimes display very challenging and violent behaviour. 'As at other YOIs for this age group, staff in Feltham A still struggled to manage this behaviour in a safe and secure way. 'Staff need more help to do this and I repeat my call for the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to initiate an independent expert review of its policies and resources for managing behaviour, reducing bullying and supporting victims across all YOIs.' Use of force had increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good. Around a quarter of boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cell, which critics said amounted to solitary confinement. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. The number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last HMIP inspection (file photo) The report calls for 'new thinking' about how to tackle the 'debilitating and seemingly intractable' problem of gangs, violence and anti-social behaviour among young people. The site for young adults still faces significant challenges, inspectors said, particularly a high level of staff vacancies. However, the report did flag significant progress at site B, with a drop in fights and assaults and a decrease in use of batons against inmates. During the inspection, eight foreign national prisoners were being held beyond the end of their sentence - including one who had been inside for two years after the end of his sentence. Inspectors labelled this delay 'completely unacceptable'. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'One in four boys in Feltham prison is spending 23 hours a day locked up in his cell in conditions which amount to solitary confinement. This is unacceptable. 'Despite some improvements, violence is endemic, including 79 assaults on staff in six months. It is particularly concerning that the use of force on children has increased dramatically since the last inspection. Use of force has increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good (file photo) 'However, the problems outlined in this report are not confined to Feltham - they mirror the findings of a series of inspections conducted across the country in recent months. 'Staff are rightly praised by the inspectorate, but they are working in challenging environments where they are being asked to achieve the impossible. 'It is high time we stopped locking up children in large, violent institutions and invest instead in what works in rehabilitating children whilst keeping them safe.' A previous inspection of site B in March 2013 called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), said: 'As this report makes clear the challenge faced by the governor and staff at Feltham should not be underestimated. 'Many of the young people in their care have strong gang affiliations and a history of violence. 'Managing their behaviour and supporting them to change and turn their lives around is a difficult and complex task. In this context the improvements achieved over the last 12 months are particularly impressive and the governor and his staff deserve huge credit for what has been achieved. 'There is no easy answer to the challenges presented by the young men in Feltham but we are committed to working positively with our partners in the YJB and in the wider community to reduce violence, prevent victims and support effective rehabilitation.'","output":"Inspectors at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI) discovered that inmates represented 48 different gangs, leading to a \\"constant juggling\\" to keep them apart. The jail has 240 inmates aged 15 to 18, and has had issues with high levels of violence, much of which is gang-related. To tackle this issue, around a quarter of the boys, most of whom are from the London area, were placed on \\"keep apart\\" lists. While the number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last inspection, there were still 262 incidents in a six-month period, including 79 assaults on staff. The use of force has increased at the site for boys, and about a quarter of the boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cells. The report calls for new thinking in managing gangs, violence, and anti-social behavior among young people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which language is this?","output":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken predominantly in the Czech Republic. Allow me to provide a translation and additional information about the Czech language. The sentence \\"Tady to je, pobral jsem to v hotelu\\" translates to \\"Here it is, I picked it up at the hotel\\" in English. The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, especially Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. It is spoken by over 10 million people in the Czech Republic and also by Czech communities worldwide. Czech is written using the Latin alphabet, with several additional diacritic marks (\`ě\`, \`š\`, \`č\`, \`ř\`, \`ž\`, \`ý\`, \`á\`, \`í\`, and \`é\`).  Czech grammar is characterized by a complex system of inflection, which includes declensions (for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals) and conjugations (for verbs). Nouns in Czech have three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and two numbers (singular and plural). The Czech language also features a rich vocabulary and a variety of speech registers, ranging from formal language or standard literary Czech to colloquial forms and regional dialects. Some well-known internationally-acclaimed Czech authors who have contributed to Czech literature include Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, Jaroslav Hašek, and Karel Čapek, who is credited with coining the word \\"robot\\" in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). Overall, the Czech language carries a long and rich history of culture and tradition. As a Slavic language, it shares similarities with neighboring languages, making it an interesting language to explore for those who are passionate about linguistics or Central European culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The context provided in the statement indicates that the person was having issues with their mower and had potentially reached out for assistance, only to be met with a lack of empathy or understanding from the individual attending to their concerns. The tone of the conversation suggests frustration, as the speaker mentioned being \\"livid\\" and mentioning that they had \\"diagnosed\\" the problem themselves when the cord snapped in their hand.

Question: India decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, and Nepal decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity.  Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","output":"India's decision to primarily use fossil fuels for electricity generation and Nepal's choice to rely on renewable energy sources, specifically hydro power, would have different impacts on the carbon cycle. To analyze the impacts, it is crucial to understand the carbon cycle, the energy mix of both countries, and the environmental consequences of their respective choices. The carbon cycle is the natural circulation of carbon through the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, soil, living organisms, and geological formations. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have disrupted the natural balance of the carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere at an accelerated rate. This accumulation of CO2 contributes to climate change, causing global warming and other environmental consequences. India, as a rapidly growing economy with an increasing energy demand, has based much of its power generation on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are major contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO2, which is released in large quantities when they are burned. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's primary energy demand is expected to double by 2040, with coal continuing to make up the largest part of their energy mix. In 2019, coal accounted for about 55% of India's energy supply, which contributes to air pollution and health issues in the country, in addition to exacerbating climate change. On the other hand, Nepal has opted for hydro power, which is a clean and renewable energy source. Hydro power harnesses the energy generated by moving water, either through rivers or rainfall, to produce electricity without releasing any GHG emissions. It is worth noting that environmental impacts can still occur from hydro power plants, such as habitat disruption, but these are usually not on the same scale as those associated with the production and combustion of fossil fuels. Nepal has significant hydro power potential due to its abundant water resources in the form of the Himalayan rivers and large rainfall amounts. Considering the differences in energy choices, it is clear that India's reliance on fossil fuels has a more significant impact on the carbon cycle, as this contributes to higher CO2 emissions and consequently, climate change. However, it is important to acknowledge that India has been taking steps to increase its renewable energy capacity, through initiatives like the National Solar Mission and wind energy projects. In contrast, Nepal's choice to primarily use hydro power for electricity generation significantly reduces their contribution to carbon emissions and impact on the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, both countries' actions should be evaluated within the broader context of global climate change, as well as their respective socio-economic situations and capacity to transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What are the different types of engineering degrees? Possible answers: -no. -yes.","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are focusing on two distinct subject matters. Let's delve deeper into the meaning of each question: 1. What are the different types of engines? This question is asking about the various kinds of engines, which are machines that convert energy into mechanical force or motion. They are used in numerous applications, such as vehicles and electrical power generation. The main types of engines include: a. Internal Combustion Engines (ICE): These engines burn a fuel-air mixture within a combustion chamber in the engine. The high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion apply force to the engine components, turning them into mechanical energy. Common examples of ICE are:    - Spark Ignition Engines (e.g., gasoline/petrol engines)    - Compression Ignition Engines (e.g., diesel engines)    - Wankel Rotary Engines b. External Combustion Engines: In these engines, the combustion of fuel occurs outside the engine, and the energy produced is transferred to the engine via a working fluid (like steam or hot air). Examples include:    - Steam Engines    - Stirling Engines c. Electric Motors: These engines utilize electrical energy and convert it into mechanical energy. The energy is supplied either through a battery or a power source. Examples are:    - Direct Current (DC) Motors    - Alternating Current (AC) Motors    - Brushless Motors (BLDC) d. Jet Engines: These engines work based on Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. They inhale air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and burn the mixture, which results in a high-speed jet of exhaust gases that propel the engine forward. Examples include:    - Turbojet Engines    - Turbofan Engines    - Turboprop Engines    - Ramjet Engines 2. What are the different types of engineering degrees? This question is inquiring about the various fields of study within the engineering domain. Engineering degrees offer specialization in designing, building, and maintaining structures, machines, systems, and processes. The main types of engineering degrees are: a. Civil Engineering: This field deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings. b. Mechanical Engineering: This discipline focuses on the design, development, and manufacturing of mechanical systems, like engines, machines, and robotics devices. c. Electrical Engineering: This field involves the study of electrical and electronic systems, which includes designing and constructing circuits, communication systems, and power generation and distribution facilities. d. Chemical Engineering: This area of engineering deals with the development and optimization of chemical processes, such as creating new materials or designing efficient production methods. e.

No The given answer, \\"The network consists of six lines with a total length of 189.63 kilometres (117.83 miles) with 142 stations, of which 35 are underground, five are at-grade, and the remainder are elevated,\\" does not directly address the question of how many of New Delhi Metro's stations are located at ground level. To provide a detailed and better response to the question, it is important to focus on the information specifically related to ground-level stations. The original answer provides information about the total number of stations (142), the number of underground stations (35), the number of at-grade stations (5), and indicates that the remaining stations are elevated. However, the question specifically asks for the number of ground-level stations (commonly known as at-grade stations). In this case, the answer should explicitly mention the number of at-grade stations, which is 5. A clearer and more direct answer to the question, \\"How many of the New Delhi Metro's stations are located at ground level?\\" would be: There are 5 at-grade stations, or ground-level stations, in the New Delhi Metro system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We'll essentially see how each of the options function as a logical and cohesive continuation of the scene described in the paragraph. The existing paragraph focuses on women in two-piece bikinis playing volleyball at a beach under a clear, blue sky.  Choice 1, \\"are several black balls floating around in the air,\\" does not fit well because it does not involve women continuing their activities, which is implied to continue by the phrase \\"now there\\". It seems awkward to shift focus to black balls without any preceding context about them. Choice 2, \\"are women playing sand volleyball at a different location and they are closer to a lot of buildings and on this day it has a very gloomy with a foggy sky,\\" doesn't fit well either. It introduces a new setting and changes the weather, disrupting the consistency of the paragraph. Contrastingly, choice 3, \\"are several other naked women doing the same thing, they are playing the game of volleyball so intensely that they have almost no energy left, and there are several people on the beach green watching them play and watching them cheer them on they're doing crazy activities and they seem super focused about partying it is so intense and hopping from every ball to the ball trying to get them all out of the way,\\" is on theme with the action of women playing volleyball, but it includes a lot of new, unnecessary information that conflicts with the existing atmosphere and tone. Choice 4, \\"are two children dressed in white shorts playing volleyball in the sand, as they run fast into the other teams to make a goal in a goal,\\" provides the most logical continuity to the paragraph. It includes the same actions (playing volleyball) and setting (at the beach), while introducing a related sub-set of characters (children) which can naturally exist within the scene.  So, following the preceding 'beach volleyball' theme, choice 4 serves as the most appropriate end to the paragraph. It maintains the atmosphere of the story, aligns with the setting, and doesn't introduce an abrupt shift in tone or context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Colts suffered their first defeat of the season, 21-14, at the hand of the Dallas Cowboys and became the last team to lose during the 2006 NFL season. The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple punts by both teams, Peyton Manning & Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third down, Manning attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass for the second time in his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line. The Cowboys scored all of their points in the second half after a first half that was full of turnovers. Colts QB Peyton Manning went 20 of 39 for 254 passing yards with two touchdown passes and two interceptions, Cowboys QB Tony Romo was 19 of 23 with 226 passing yards and had one interception. Colts WR Reggie Wayne had 7 catches for 111 yards, and Cowboys RB Julius Jones rushed the football 22 times for 79 yards.

As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.

A:","output":"\\"I Write the Songs\\" is a popular song that was famously performed by David Cassidy, but he did not write it. The song was composed by renowned American songwriter and musician, Bruce Johnston. Born on June 27, 1942, Bruce Johnston is perhaps best known as a member of the Beach Boys, a rock band made famous during the 60s and 70s for their unique and innovative pop and rock music. Johnston joined the band in 1965 and became an integral part of its success, contributing not just as a singer but also as a songwriter, and instrumentalist. \\"I Write the Songs\\" is a notable contribution from Johnston's career as a songwriter, which was released in 1975. Despite the common misunderstanding, David Cassidy was not the first to record it. The song was first recorded by The Captain & Tennille on their \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" album. David Cassidy released his own version later in 1975 on his \\"The Higher They Climb\\" album. The song was hugely popularized when it was recorded by Barry Manilow the following year, in 1976. Manilow's version soared to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The song itself is a kind of self-tribute to the craft of songwriting. Through the lyrics, Johnston portrays the power of music and songs to bring happiness, invoke nostalgia, and stir emotions in listeners. In sum, \\"I Write the Songs\\" was written by Bruce Johnston, and while it was successfully covered by David Cassidy and other artists, Johnston's creative input as a composer was a crucial part of the song's journey to becoming a pop icon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The long, cold winter is over. The weather is warmer and sunnier. The trees again have leaves and the flowers are blooming. The season represents hope, joy and beauty. At this time, many people think of this classical music piece -- Spring, which shows happiness. Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote it in the seventeen hundred. However, not all songs about spring are happy. This song written and sung by K.D. Lang is about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. She recorded I Dream of Spring in 2008. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote It Might as Well Be Spring for the movie State Fair in 1945. Frank Sinatra sings it. It is a feeling of restlessness or excitement brought on by the coming of spring. Richard Rodgers also wrote Spring Is Here, this time with Lorenz Hart. Ella Fitzgerald sings this song about feeling lonely during this season. Frank Loesser wrote the sad song, Spring Will be a Little Late This Year. Why has the season been delayed?

In the given phrase, \\"V pohodě\\" means \\"Alright\\" or \\"Fine,\\" and \\"Děkuju\\" is the Czech way of saying \\"Thank you\\" or expressing gratitude.  The Czech language, also known as čeština, belongs to the West Slavic branch of the Slavic languages. It is spoken by approximately 10 million people, mainly in the Czech Republic. It developed from the Proto-Slavic language around the 10th century AD, with its written form taking shape in the 11th century. Over the years, it has been influenced by Latin, Hebrew, and German among other languages. Czech shares similarities with other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Slovenian. The language uses the Latin script with additional diacritics, such as the háček (ˇ) and the acute accent (´). These diacritics help denote the specific pronunciation of consonants and vowels, which is vital since the language is highly phonetic, i.e., words are written as they are pronounced. Key aspects of Czech grammar include extensive inflection, which means that nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals have different forms based on their grammatical function in a sentence; verbs are conjugated according to tense, mood, and person, and they also have different forms for the active, passive, and reflexive voice. Additionally, Czech word order is flexible but predominantly subject-verb-object (SVO). In summary, the translation of \\"V pohodě. Děkuju\\" from Czech to English is \\"Alright. Thank you.\\" The Czech language is a rich and complex West Slavic language spoken predominantly in the Czech Republic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Thus, although Tom is living with an incurable disease, it is possible that his condition is being managed with medication and he is living a relatively normal life. In conclusion, of the two friends, Andy is the one who does not have a disease without a known cure, as he is healthy and not infected with HIV/AIDS. Tom has been living with HIV for the past 20 years, but proper medical management can help delay the progression of the disease to AIDS and allow him to maintain a longer life expectancy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Southwest, AirTran pilots reach deal on seniority lists Southwest's acquisition of AirTran cleared a significant milestone over the weekend, with the airline saying it reached an agreement \\"in principle\\" with its pilots unions on combining seniority lists. The Associated Press notes \\"the deal between Southwest, the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association and the Air Line Pilots Association must be approved by both unions' boards and ratified by their memberships.\\" Seniority lists are crucially important to pilots and to other unionized groups at U.S. airlines. The lists determine everything from pay to scheduling. For pilots, such lists govern which type of aircraft they fly and determines priority for preferable routes and schedules. \\"It's really a big milestone for the pilots to come to this agreement in principle,\\" Southwest spokesman Paul Flaningan says to Bloomberg News. \\"It gives a signal to the other unions that everyone is moving forward with the integration.\\" Reaching a deal on combining seniority list can be one of the thorniest details in finalizing an airline merger. At US Airways, for example, pilots have failed to reach an agreement on how to combine seniority lists there, even though the America West-US Airways merger closed nearly six years ago. The failure to do so has kept the airline from combining flight crews, depriving US Airways of some of the financial benefits of the merger by forcing it to continue to -- more or less -- fly as two separate airlines under a single brand. The lack of a deal also has prevented US Airways pilots from negotiating a new combined contract, which most expect would boost their compensation. Given that background, the significance of Southwest's just-announced pact doesn't appear to be lost on Southwest COO Mike Van de Ven. \\"The unions and Company negotiating teams have accomplished a task that is rare in this industry, developing an integrated seniority list and transition plan for our Pilots outside of arbitration,\\" Van de Ven says in a statement. Despite the important milestone, the Southwest-AirTran merger is expected to continue at a cautious pace. For example, Southwest has said it does not expect to even begin repainting AirTran's planes until sometime next year. For now, the airlines are operating separately. What was this article about?","output":"This article reports on a significant milestone reached in the acquisition of AirTran by Southwest Airlines. Over the weekend, the airline announced that it had reached an agreement \\"in principle\\" with its pilots unions on combining seniority lists. The deal between Southwest, the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association, and the Air Line Pilots Association will still need to be approved by both unions' boards and ratified by their memberships. Seniority lists are essential for pilots and other unionized groups at U.S. airlines, determining factors such as pay, scheduling, type of aircraft flown, and priority for preferable routes and schedules. The agreement represents a major step forward for the merger process, and a positive signal to other unions involved in the integration process. Combining seniority lists can be a difficult and contentious aspect of airline mergers, as exemplified by the ongoing situation at US Airways, where the lack of an agreement has prevented the full realization of merger benefits. In contrast, the Southwest-AirTran merger's progress in this area has been acknowledged by Southwest COO Mike Van de Ven, who praised the unions and negotiating teams for their accomplishment. Nonetheless, the merger is expected to continue at a cautious pace, with Southwest stating that they do not expect to begin repainting AirTran's planes until some time next year, and the airlines continuing to operate separately for the time being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  Now, I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Answer this question please: Which country would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, Germany or France? A:","output":"Germany would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply due to its lower tax rate below the critical point.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What is the location of the temple built in the style that is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features in 1200? from the following article ?  The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine  (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234)  are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics.... A:","output":"The answer to the question regarding the location of the temple built in 1200 in the style considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features can be found in the article.

He had been assured by his teacher Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann was born in Zwickau, in the Kingdom of Saxony, the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (nee Schnabel) and August Schumann. Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music - undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.  Schumann began receiving general musical and piano instruction at the age of seven from Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music and worked at creating musical compositions himself, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The Universal Journal of Music 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \\"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody, - ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\\"  At age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled Portraits of Famous Men. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers Schiller and Goethe, as well as Byron and the Greek tragedians. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was Jean Paul, a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels Juniusabende, completed in 1826, and Selene.  Schumann's interest in music was sparked by seeing a performance of Ignaz Moscheles playing at Karlsbad, and he later developed an interest in the works of Beethoven, Schubert and Mendelssohn. His father, who had encouraged the boy's musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Neither his mother nor his guardian thereafter encouraged a career in music. In 1828 Schumann left school, and after a tour during which he met Heinrich Heine in Munich, he went to Leipzig to study law (to meet the terms of his inheritance). In 1829 his law studies continued in Heidelberg, where he became a lifelong member of Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

Question: Detroit is NOT in what area of the United States? Context: Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.

Article: John Dowd (pictured) had been spearheading negotiations with Special Counsel Robert Mueller for a potential interview with the president, while Jay Sekulow handled public communications. | Richard Dew/AP Photo Trump’s Russia probe lawyer John Dowd resigns The departure comes amid a larger shakeup of the legal team handling the Mueller investigation.      John Dowd resigned Thursday as President Donald Trump’s lead lawyer for the Russia investigation amid a wider shakeup of Trump’s legal team that raised new questions about Trump’s strategy for dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller.      Dowd stepped down just days after he issued a statement calling for Mueller’s probe to be shuttered, which he first attributed with his title as the president’s lawyer and then backtracked to say he was speaking only for himself.      Story Continued Below      “I love the president and wish him well,” Dowd said in an email to POLITICO.      Dowd, a prominent Washington white collar defense attorney with a prickly demeanor, signed on as a personal attorney to the president last June and recently had been spearheading negotiations with Mueller for a potential interview with the president.      But the 77-year old attorney had grown increasingly frustrated by his work for Trump, according to a source familiar with the Trump legal team strategy. Dowd was particularly upset to learn on Monday that Trump had decided to hire Joseph diGenova, another bulldog lawyer and scandal veteran to help with his Russia response.      Trump had also been gauging interest from other prominent attorneys, including former George W. Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson, who recently turned down an offer from Trump by citing conflicts with his law firm.      Trump’s legal team has long been riven by a debate about how Trump should handle Mueller’s investigation in both political and legal terms. Dowd had preached a confrontational approach, warning Trump of the risks of speaking to Mueller—at the risk of perjuring himself—and calling in a Saturday morning statement on the Justice Department to “bring an end” to its “manufactured” Russia probe.      Asked Thursday at a China trade event at the White House whether he was still willing to speak to Mueller, the president responded, “Yes, I would like to.”      Given the recent addition of the combative diGenova to Trump’s team, it is not clear that Dowd’s departure will substantially impact its overall strategy.

You can unsubscribe at any time.            Dowd had previously been known best for representing Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during the Keating Five Scandal, and for leading a Major League Baseball investigation of gambling allegations surrounding baseball great Pete Rose.      Jay Sekulow, who has been handling public communications and research on constitutional issues for the Trump legal team, declined on Thursday to answer questions about how the president’s attorneys would be organized going forward.      “John Dowd has been a valuable member of our legal team and we will continue our ongoing cooperation with the office of special counsel regarding this inquiry,” Sekulow said in a statement to POLITICO.      Trump’s legal team has seen remarkable flux, particularly given the stakes for a president who could potentially face impeachment or even indictment over allegations that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin and that he has sought to obstruct justice. Trump insists that such charges have been manufactured by political partisans.      The president originally tapped his longtime personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz to represent him in the Justice Department’s Russia probe, which Mueller has led since shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last May.      But the New York-based Kasowitz stepped down last summer amid concerns he wasn’t best positioned to tangle with a Washington scandal.      While the president continues to speak with Kasowitz, he has mainly relied on Dowd and Sekulow to manage the Russia probe for him as an individual. Washington lawyer Ty Cobb runs the White House’s official response to the investigation with a team of about five aides who draw taxpayer salaries.      The changes to the Trump legal team are seen as a bad omen for Cobb, who has been urging cooperation with Mueller. In an interview on Wednesday, former Cobb law partner Robert Bennett called for Cobb to resign in order to preserve his professional reputation.      “I hope my friend Ty Cobb will leave the team. He’s not helping himself or his reputation,” Bennett said.      Cobb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Trump has recently been frustrated with his lawyers, who had been giving him a steadily changing series of target completion dates for a Mueller probe that has only appeared to widen in recent weeks to include allegations, seemingly unrelated to Russia, that a consultant for the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worked with a top GOP fundraiser.      On Saturday, Trump tweeted that “the Mueller probe should never have been started,” insisting that “there was no collusion and there was no crime” and branding the investigation a “WITCH HUNT.” It was the first time Trump had specifically mentioned Mueller by name on Twitter — something his lawyers have counseled him to avoid doing.      This week he hired diGenova, a fierce critic of the Russia investigation who earlier this year told Fox News that Trump had been framed by the Justice Department and FBI “with a falsely created crime.”      Trump’s free-wheeling style has worn on his lawyers. He’s ignored their advice to restrain himself on Twitter and disregarded their counsel that he not discuss details of the probe beyond his legal team.      poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201803/1853/1155968404_5756709788001_5756676647001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true      Legal experts say those are reasons why Trump has struggled to attract the caliber of lawyer that has historically leapt to represent a sitting president. Olson, Robert Giuffra Jr. and Reid Weingarten were among the elite attorneys who declined job offers from Trump last spring, while former George W. Bush attorneys Bill Burck and Emmet Flood rejected overtures for the position ultimately accepted by Cobb.      “The notion of saying no to represent the president of the United States is kind of amazing,” said Bennett, a former personal attorney to President Bill Clinton.      Trump may not be done looking for lawyers. Flood met with the president earlier this month at the White House, though it’s unclear if that has led to a job offer.      The diGenova hiring came days after Dowd issued a Saturday morning statement calling for Mueller’s work to end.      “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd told the Daily Beast, responding to Sessions’ decision the night before to fire Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director.      Dowd initially said he was speaking in his official capacity as Trump’s lawyer. But he later retracted that statement, telling POLITICO he was commenting in his personal capacity.      It was one of several instances where Dowd raised eyebrows—and in some cases, drew ridicule—for his public commentary about the Russia probe.      Last December, Dowd took blame for a tweet posted on Trump’s account that appeared to admit Trump was aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI before Trump urged Comey to drop the Russia investigation. The tweet puzzled legal experts who said the admission could fuel an obstruction of justice case against Trump.      Dowd later argued that Trump could not be found guilty of obstruction of justice because of his role as chief executive under the Constitution, an argument that many legal experts disputed.      Both Dowd and Cobb also were embarrassed last summer after a New York Times reporter overheard them speaking about the Russia investigation at a Washington restaurant.      Dowd is well-known for his gruff manner, which was on vivid display outside a federal courthouse in 2011 when he told a CNBC camera crew to “get the fuck out of here” before giving the cameraman the middle finger.      Asked recently by POLITICO to comment on talks between the president’s lawyers and Mueller’s investigators, Dowd was only somewhat friendlier: “None of your business,” he said.       ||||| WASHINGTON — John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators.      After days of uncertainty among the president’s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said.      Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. “I would like to,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “I would like to.”      Mr. Dowd’s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides. ||||| Update, March 22, 2018: John Dowd, the president’s lead lawyer in the special counsel’s investigation, has resigned. Read the latest, here.      WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter, as he openly discussed firing one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third — who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the F.B.I. — joined the roster.      Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after The New York Times began making inquiries.      Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has contemplated leaving his post because he has concluded that he has no control over the behavior of the president, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy of publicly assailing the inquiry that he initially adopted in the weeks immediately after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed. Now the president has begun attacking Mr. Mueller himself. |||||Summary:","output":"John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation, has resigned.

Dowd had recently been leading negotiations with Mueller for a potential interview with the president. However, he had grown increasingly frustrated with his work for Trump and disagreed with the president's decision to hire Joseph diGenova, another lawyer experienced in handling scandals. It is unclear how Dowd's departure will affect the overall strategy of Trump's legal team."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\"  After reading the above, is \\"Vietnam has been very irritated\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Contradictory statements by the government of Malaysia have irritated what country involved with the investigation?\\"?

Haviland is a city in Kiowa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 701. It is home of Barclay College and known for meteorite finds connected to the Haviland Crater and for an annual meteorite festival held in July. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? People have made various meteorite finds in Haviland.","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph you provided, we can conclude that the statement \\"People have made various meteorite finds in Haviland\\" is true. Haviland, Kansas, is indeed noted for meteorite finds, which are presumably connected to the Haviland Crater.  This conclusion is drawn based on the information which states Haviland is known for meteorite finds. This suggests that meteorites have been found in the area, probably more than once given the use of the generic term \\"finds\\". When it's mentioned that something the city is \\"known for\\", that generally implies a repeated or consistent occurrence over time, hence we can conclude multiple finds have been made. Additionally, the city celebrates an annual meteorite festival in July. Such an event would likely not occur unless there was a significant amount of interest in meteorites in the area, which would presumably be driven by local finds. The festival may include various activities related to meteorites, which again indicates that more than one meteorite has been found in Haviland.  Moreover, the presence of the Haviland Crater suggests past meteor impacts, which further substantiates the likelihood of numerous meteorite finds in the city. The fact that the city also hosts the Barclay College may also contribute to meteorite research or discoveries given that universities often conduct scientific studies in the locales nearby.  In conclusion, based on information provided, we can definitely affirm that Haviland has been a site of various meteorite finds, although the exact number, types, and sizes of these meteorites are not specified in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Mary Harris Jones, widely known as Mother Jones, was a labor activist and organizer who played a key role in the American labor movement during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She accomplished several important things that had a significant impact on workers' rights and labor conditions in the United States. Some of her key accomplishments include: 1. Advocating for workers' rights: Mother Jones campaigned tirelessly for better working conditions, fair wages, and an end to child labor. She traveled across the country, organizing strikes and speaking at rallies to raise awareness about the struggles faced by working-class people. 2. Founding the Social Democratic Party: Mother Jones was a founding member of the Social Democratic Party (which later became the Socialist Party of America) in 1898. Through this political organization, she helped to advance the cause of workers' rights and social justice in the United States. 3. Role in the United Mine Workers: Mother Jones was a key organizer for the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), a labor union that represented coal miners. She played a significant role in several major strikes, including the 1902 Anthracite Coal Strike in Pennsylvania, which led to improvements in wages and working conditions for miners. 4. The March of the Mill Children: In 1903, Mother Jones organized the March of the Mill Children, a protest against child labor. She led a group of child textile workers from Philadelphia to President Theodore Roosevelt's home in Long Island, New York, to demand better working conditions and the end of child labor. While the march did not directly result in legislation, it raised awareness of the issue and contributed to the eventual passage of child labor laws in the United States. 5. Continuing her activism into old age: Despite facing numerous arrests and threats from powerful industrialists, Mother Jones continued her labor activism well into her eighties, earning her the title \\"the most dangerous woman in America\\" from some opponents. In summary, Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones was a tireless advocate for workers' rights and social justice. Her accomplishments include organizing strikes, founding a political party, and playing a major role in the American labor movement, fighting against child labor, and advocating for better working conditions and fair wages for workers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select the topic that this about: Bomb explosions hit five petrol stations in the Madrid area on Friday after a telephoned warning from armed Basque separatist group ETA, police said. pick from the following. A. World; B. Sports; C. Business; D. Science/Tech;","output":"This topic falls under category A: World. The mentioned event discusses the actions of an armed Basque separatist group known as ETA, who claimed responsibility for the explosions that occurred at five petrol stations in the Madrid area. This incident is related to global news and international affairs, directly impacting society and the political landscape. ETA, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, which means \\"Basque Homeland and Liberty\\" in the Basque language, is a violent separatist organization that sought independence for the Basque Country (an autonomous community in northern Spain) from the late 1950s till 2018, when the group officially disbanded. Established as a nationalist political organization, ETA later turned to paramilitarism in its pursuit of an independent and socialist Basque state, launching a terrorist campaign that lasted for decades. Throughout its existence, the group committed bombings, assassinations, and various acts of sabotage, resulting in the death of over 800 people, including police, military personnel, officials, and civilians. The bombings in Madrid, mentioned in the provided information, were part of ETA's modus operandi of using explosives to target structures and people to promote their cause and garner attention. The Spanish government and law enforcement agencies have historically considered ETA a terrorist organization. Its actions have been consistently condemned by both national and international authorities, leading to increased counter-terrorism efforts and cooperation with other European countries such as France to dismantle the group's activities. Amid declining popular support and internal disagreements, ETA announced a permanent ceasefire in 2011, and in 2018, the group disbanded, marking an end to their militant activities. Despite the organization's dissolution, the consequences of ETA's attacks continue to influence the Basque Country and Spanish society on multiple fronts. These include ongoing political debates about the region's aspirations for independence and the role of the central government, efforts to address and compensate the victims of the group's attacks, and the challenge of reintegrating former militants into society. In conclusion, such an event surrounding ETA's attack on petrol stations in Madrid is more appropriately placed under the world news category, as it involves an armed separatist group engaging in violent activities that have international implications, and it deals with critical political and societal issues within a global context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The seven-carriage train pulled into a new station in the city after travelling the 75-km (47-mile) route without any cargo. The line was completed last year at a cost of 165 million (Â£105m). The authorities hope to open up new trade routes and link Afghanistan to its neighbours' rail networks. The new line could also become a key supply route for Nato forces in Afghanistan and help take military equipment out when the international troops withdraw, starting in 2012. The US has been shifting its supply lines into the north and away from the volatile route from Pakistan. The first journey on Wednesday was intended to test the track and signals, before the formal opening of the project at which President Hamid Karzai is expected to attend. \\"This is a matter of pride for us and a very important issue for Afghanistan,\\" said Deputy Public Works Minister Noor Gul Mangal, who was there to watch the train arrive in Mazar-e-Sharif. He said the government planned to build another line into Turkmenistan, to the north-west. The new line to Mazar-e-Sharif runs from the border town of Hairatan, which is currently a major bottleneck for goods entering Afghanistan. Supplies have to be taken off Uzbek trains and loaded on to trucks to continue their journey. The railway should enable goods to be taken straight to Mazar-e-Sharif, avoiding the queues and significantly increasing the volume of goods that can be transported. Afghanistan's neighbours, including Pakistan and Uzbekistan, have good railway networks built by their former rulers, Britain and Russia. However, Afghanistan has never had a functioning rail system. Railway projects were started several times in the 19th and 20th centuries, by British and then Soviet authorities, only to be abandoned for political reasons. Afghanistan has long been the missing link between the rail networks of China, India and the Middle East.

This Christian holiday is not on the same date every year,but it's always on a Sunday. It can be any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Many people celebrate Easter by buying new clothes. Children celebrate by hunting for colored eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day. But the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection from the dead. Most people color Easter eggs. Some people hide them. Others just eat them.

The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story. Premise: After months of hard training I was ready for my first boxing match.   Initial Context: I was nervous and sweaty with a lot of doubt.   Original Ending: The judge called us over and began the match. I was trying my best to stay calm throughout the fight. At the end of the boxing match I KO my opponent and won.   Counterfactual Context: I was confident in my ability to win. Output:","output":"The judge called us over and began the match. I maintained my confidence throughout the fight. At the end of the boxing match, I KO'd my opponent and won."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Now, I have a new situation: John has just started working at a new company.

China Cabinet A good place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at is in a china cabinet. Here is a detailed explanation of each option: A. Kitchen - While you can display your saucer in the kitchen, it might not be the best place due to the potential exposure to cooking fumes, grease, and moisture, which could result in discoloration or damage to your cherished piece. B. Tea room - A tea room might be a suitable place to display your saucer, as it is a designated space for tea-related items. However, not every home has a dedicated tea room, and it may not be the best option for those who want to protect their delicate items from potential accidents during tea service. C. China cabinet - The china cabinet is the best place to display your saucer, as it offers a secure and controlled environment for your fragile and precious items. China cabinets usually come with glass doors, allowing you to have a clear view of your displayed pieces while keeping them safe from dust, contaminants, and potential accidents. The cabinets also help in controlling humidity and temperature, ensuring the longevity and preservation of your saucer. D. Kitchen cabinet - A kitchen cabinet can store your saucer securely, but it might not allow you to admire the piece since the cabinet doors are typically opaque. Furthermore, it may not provide optimal protection, as moisture and temperature fluctuations in the kitchen might affect the condition of your saucer over time. E. Cup - Placing a saucer inside a cup is not an ideal solution for displaying the item, as this would hide its beauty and intricate designs. It also puts your saucer at risk of damage when the cup is used or moved around. In conclusion, a china cabinet is the best option for displaying a saucer you don't use but want to look at. It provides you with the opportunity to admire your piece while ensuring its safety, preservation, and protection from environmental factors and potential accidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: 277 * v = -250 * v + 490 * v + 37 First, let's add the values that have 'v' together on the right side. So, we'll add -250 * v and 490 * v. Let's see: -250 * v + 490 * v = 240 * v (because 490 - 250 = 240) Now our equation looks like this: 277 * v = 240 * v + 37 Next, we want to get all the 'v' terms on one side and the number on the other side. So let's subtract 240 * v from both sides of the equation. Here's what we get: 277 * v - 240 * v = 37 Now, let's find the difference between 277 * v and 240 * v: 37 * v = 37 Finally, to find the value of 'v', let's divide both sides of the equation by 37: v = 1 And there you go, buddy!

Article: Whether it's a carol service or an evening of karaoke in the pub, many people will enjoy a good old singsong this Christmas. Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health. For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. \\"Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .\\" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. \\"And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. \\" Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. \\"It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .\\" But she warns people not to have too many beers or glasses of wine, though a glass may help them gather courage before taking to the stage during the holidays.

Mohammed Labead, 19, seriously injured PC Lee Wilson, 42, as he went to the aid of colleague Sgt Rachael Shearing after an assault on a girl. Labead, of Norwich, yesterday admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on PC Wilson without intent on January 19 this year. Scroll down for video PC Lee Wilson attempts to grapple with Mohammed Labead outside Mojo's nightclub in Norwich in January Labead managed to break free from PC Wilson's grip and started pushing him towards the corner He said","output":"the attack occurred after he had consumed a large amount of alcohol and could not remember much of the night, including attacking the officer. Sentencing Labead at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Stephen Holt told him that his actions had caused significant harm to PC Wilson and that this was a serious matter. Judge Holt stated that Labead had demonstrated a lack of respect for the police and that his attack caused distress to the officers on the scene. The court heard that on the night of the incident, PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing were called to Mojo's nightclub following reports of an altercation involving a girl who had been assaulted. Upon arriving at the scene, they found Labead acting aggressively and shouting at other clubbers. Believing that Labead may have been responsible for the assault, they attempted to apprehend him. The scene outside the nightclub was chaotic as Labead resisted arrest, trying to break free from the officers and push PC Wilson to the ground. As the struggle continued, PC Wilson's leg was badly broken in multiple places. The officers were eventually able to subdue Labead with the help of additional police backup. PC Wilson was then rushed to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery on his leg. During the court proceedings, Labead expressed remorse for his actions and claimed that the attack was not a true reflection of his character. His defense counsel argued that Labead had no previous history of violence and had been under the influence of excessive alcohol, which clouded his judgment. Judge Holt took these factors into consideration along with Labead's early guilty plea. He acknowledged Labead's remorse but stated that it was crucial to send a strong message that attacks on police officers would not be tolerated. Consequently, Labead was sentenced to 28 months in prison for the crime. As the story comes to an end, Mohammed Labead begins to serve his prison sentence while reflecting on the consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, PC Wilson embarks on a long road to recovery, undergoing extensive physical rehabilitation to regain the use of his leg. The incident underlines the dangers that police officers face every day and the importance of respecting law enforcement. In addition to the physical scars, the emotional trauma inflicted on both PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing will leave a lasting impact on their lives and careers. The event also serves as a reminder to society of the potential consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and the importance of responsible drinking. Overall, the story ends with a harsh lesson learned for all parties involved. Mohammed Labead must now face the consequences of his actions and work towards rebuilding his life after serving his sentence. Similarly, PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing will continue to heal from the ordeal, further strengthening their dedication to protecting and serving their community."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Why did the author notice Barend? - because he was dirty and snotty, - not enough information - because he wore old clothes - because he liked his shadow, Answer:","output":"because he liked his shadow"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band's fourth album, Odyssey Number Five. The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart--the first Powderfinger song to do so. Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work, and the loneliness that came as a result. \\"My Happiness\\" was put on heavy rotation by Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM two months prior to its United States release, and Powderfinger signed a contract with United States label Republic as a result of the song's early success. Beat journalist Jayson Argall joked the song had received \\"a bit\\" of airplay. Although \\"My Happiness\\" was subsequently dropped from KROQ's roster, other radio stations continued to give the song high priority.  \\"My Happiness\\" peaked at number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, making it the first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards \\"My Happiness\\" because it was \\"melodic, [and] pretty\\"--a change from what she described as \\"middle of the road rock\\" popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were \\"starting to get sick of My Happiness\\"--Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that this was one of the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.  Powderfinger performed \\"My Happiness\\" live on the Late Show with David Letterman while touring North America with British rock group Coldplay. They were the fourth Australian act (after The Living End, Silverchair, and Nick Cave) to play on the show. The band also did free promotional shows leading up to the release of the single. In Europe, \\"My Happiness\\" received approximately four weeks of airplay on German music video program Viva II, and the band sold out for three nights in a row in London, partly due to the success of the single. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did they focus their promotion efforts on the United States after that?","output":"Yes, Powderfinger focused their promotion efforts on the United States after the early success of \\"My Happiness.\\" Australians were starting to get tired of the song, so the band decided to focus on the offshore market, like the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do this, we'll add 18 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 18 = -9d - 18 + 18 This simplifies to: 18 = -9d Step 3: Solve for d Now, to find the value of d, we need to divide both sides by -9: 18 / -9 = -9d / -9 This simplifies to: -2 = d So, the solution to the equation 0 = 2*d - 11*d - 18 is d = -2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: So, I’m a student and I also work in a very popular store in my country, which means I don’t work there everyday.  One day, my boyfriend and I were just chilling at his place, doing things like watching videos and stuff. Then he tells me that his stomach hurts (this happens from time to time and we don’t really know what the reason is yet) so he goes to the bathroom and comes up again a while later. He sits down and tells me that it hurts A LOT in the lower parts of his belly before he just kinda leans backwards in his chair. I thought this was because he was just showing how bad it hurt, but he wasn’t giving me any answer when I talked to him. Me: Ouw.. does it hurt that bad?  BF: *Doesn’t say anything, still leaning backwards in his chair, I can’t see his face* Me: Hey BF... you ok?   BF: *Still quite and starts to slide down his chair* Me: BF???! He slides down to the ground and I try to catch him so he doesn’t slam into the floor. He had passed out. I had never seen anyone pass out in-front of me before, it was so scary, so I panicked and yelled for help, thinking he was dying.  Thankfully he woke up a bit later, after his sister had come as well to see what was happening. We took him to the doctor and we were there for SO many hours, until 2 am, for them to say that there was nothing wrong. I had work the next morning, but I didn’t leave the hospital while my BF was there to get it checked since I had been the only witness to him passing out.  I was so scared and still felt shaken afterwards, in the morning I told my work I wasn’t coming in that day. I wanted to look over my boyfriend to make sure that he was okay, everyone else was going to work in the house so I wanted someone to be there. And honestly, I couldn’t stop thinking of the moment he was passing out either, if I was at work that day I just wouldn’t be able to focus. I later told my parents about this and both of them thought I was wrong to not go to work that day. That it wasn’t a good enough reason and that I should’ve went anyways.

It is the first major work on the Dome for more than five decades. Officials say damage is not due to Washington DC earthquake in 2011. Most of the work will be done at night or over weekends, say officials.","output":"Title: Major Restoration of the Capitol Dome: A First in Five Decades The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) announced today the commencement of major restoration work on the Capitol Dome, marking the first significant renovations in over fifty years. The AOC has outlined the details of the project, highlighting that the damage is not a result of the widely-reported Washington DC earthquake in 2011. The majority of construction work will be carried out at night or over weekends to minimize disruptions to daily legislative proceedings. Historically, the Capitol Dome has been an iconic symbol of American democracy and embodies the nation's architectural prowess. Constructed over a century ago, the ironwork structure has been subject to regular wear and tear, and it became apparent that intricate restoration efforts were necessary to preserve this landmark's integrity. The Capitol Dome receives millions of visitors a year, emphasizing the importance of retaining its structural soundness and aesthetic appeal. The AOC assures that the damage sustained by the Capitol Dome is not a consequence of the 2011 earthquake that hit the region, causing significant structural damage to several notable buildings in the area. Instead, officials have attributed the current mandate for restoration to natural aging and exposure to the elements over an extended period of time. The visible wear and tear on the building have, therefore, necessitated repairs to ensure that the Dome remains a steadfast symbol of the nation. In addition to the restoration of the Dome, the AOC has announced that the project will also address conservation needs in the Capitol's surrounding areas, improving aesthetics and longevity. The restoration work will primarily focus on resolving ongoing water infiltration issues, repairing historical and structural ironwork, updating lighting systems, and repainting the dome. In a considerate move to minimize disruption to the government's regular operations, officials have announced that construction work will primarily take place during nighttime hours or over weekends. The project's timeline is set to ensure that the Capitol Dome remains fully functional during standard work hours, allowing legislators uninterrupted access to essential facilities while preserving this symbolic structure for generations to come. The major restoration work on the Capitol Dome represents a significant undertaking in the preservation of U.S. history and architectural legacy. The effort serves as a testament to the nation's commitment to maintaining the aesthetic and structural integrity of its most iconic landmarks. While the project poses logistical complications in executing essential repairs without disrupting the Capitol's vital daily functions, the undertaking represents the importance placed on maintaining the icon for future generations. In conclusion, the Architect of the Capitol's announcement signifies the beginning of a new chapter for this historic landmark. With meticulous attention to detail and forward-thinking preservation techniques, the Capitol Dome will continue to stand as a testament to American democracy and architectural splendor. As the work commences over the coming months, using primarily evening and weekend hours for minimal interference in the political arena, the nation can look forward to a beautifully restored Capitol Dome ready to welcome its next fifty years of service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Create a persona for the reviewer To create a context for the review, I imagine a persona for the reviewer. In this case, I picture a user who is new to messaging apps and values simplicity and user-friendliness over advanced features. Step 4: Write the review Title: \\"Complicated interface, too many features to keep track of\\" I had high expectations for Telegram given its reputation for being a secure messaging app, but I can't say my experience has been great. The interface is not very intuitive and seems cluttered compared to other messaging apps I've used. As someone who values simplicity, I found it overwhelming. On top of that, the app seems to be bloated with features that I don't need. Just wanted a basic messaging app, but there's so much going on in Telegram that navigating through the menus is a hassle. I also had a few issues with notifications not being delivered on time or at all.  I can see how it might be useful for people who love exploring every feature and setting, but I can't give them more than 2 stars.

Kovacs was killed in a car accident in Los Angeles during the early morning hours of January 13, 1962. Kovacs, who had worked for much of the evening, met Adams at a baby shower given by Billy Wilder for Milton Berle and his wife, who had recently adopted a newborn baby boy. The couple left the party in separate cars. After a light southern California rainstorm, Kovacs lost control of his Chevrolet Corvair station wagon while turning quickly, and crashed into a power pole at the corner of Beverly Glen and Santa Monica Boulevards. He was thrown halfway out the passenger side, and died almost instantly from chest and head injuries.  A photographer managed to arrive moments later, and graphic images of Kovacs's dead body appeared in newspapers across the United States. An unlit cigar lay on the pavement, inches from his outstretched arm. Years later, in a documentary about Kovacs, Edie Adams described telephoning the police impatiently when she learned of the crash. An official cupped his hand over the receiver, saying to a colleague, \\"It's Mrs. Kovacs, he's on his way to the coroner - what should I tell her?\\" With that, Adams's fears were confirmed, and she became inconsolable. Jack Lemmon, who also attended the Berle party, identified Kovacs's body at the morgue because Adams was too distraught to do so.  After attending funerals for Hollywood friends, Kovacs had expressed his wishes to Adams that any funeral services for him be kept simple. In keeping with his request, Adams made arrangements for Presbyterian services at the Beverly Hills Community Presbyterian Church. The active pallbearers were Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Billy Wilder, Mervyn LeRoy, and Joe Mikolas. Kovacs's father and brother, Andrew and Tom, respectively, served as honorary pallbearers. The attendees included George Burns, Groucho Marx, Edward G. Robinson, Kirk Douglas, Jack Benny, James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Buster Keaton and Milton Berle. There was no typical Hollywood-type eulogy, but the church's pastor paid tribute to Kovacs, adding that he once summed up his life in two sentences: \\"I was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1919 to a Hungarian couple. I've been smoking cigars ever since.\\"  Kovacs is buried in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. His epitaph reads, \\"Nothing in moderation--We all loved him.\\" Only one of Kovacs's three children survives: his eldest, Elizabeth, from his first marriage. Kippie, his second daughter, died on July 28, 2001 at the age of 52, after a long illness and a lifetime of poor health. Kippie and her husband, Bill Lancaster (1947-1997), a screenwriter and the son of actor Burt Lancaster, are the parents of Kovacs's only grandchild, Keigh Lancaster. His only child with Edie Adams, Mia (1959-1982), was killed on May 8, 1982, also in an automobile accident. Her gravestone reads \\"Daddy's little girl. We all loved her, too\\".

Article: German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed that \\"On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges.\\" Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that \\"although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right.\\" Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs. Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought. On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds. The presence of noble women in the French \\"lodges of adoption\\" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.

Answer the following question: It was a hot summer afternoon; I think I was 12. It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we’d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late. To this day, my Mom is miffed at some family members that we had to find out that way (she was pretty close to this sister so she feels someone should’ve called before it got on the news) but as for me, I will never forget that look on my Dad’s face. After the aunt drowned, how does dad feel? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Terrible since he had to tell his wife about it.  B. Shocked that he heard it on the radio.  C. Angry that his wife's family did not contact them first.  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. Terrible since he had to tell his wife about it.  In the story, when the Dad came back home after hearing the tragic news on the radio, it is clear from his facial expression that he felt terrible about the situation. His look, described as chilling, reflects the difficulty of having to tell his wife about her sister's drowning. The fact that they had to find out through the radio, rather than a direct call from family, was likely an additional source of distress for both the Dad and his wife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When a game ended, our chats from that game ended with it. Every 45 minutes or so, everything would disappear, and I wanted to preserve all of it, proof that such things are possible, and at any age. After a week, I told my best friend back East what was happening. She told me a story about a co-worker who had an online relationship with a woman for two years. Now they are married. I laughed it off and thanked her, but I told her I had no illusions. We were always brutally honest about our future, namely in agreeing there wasn’t one. It wasn’t even clear that she was coming back to Reno; she would go wherever she managed to land a job. We were a most pleasant distraction for each other, but school would eventually resume for her, and I’d eventually meet someone in Reno. On the Words With Friends board, we were both masters of the endgame, but there didn’t seem to be any endgame for us in real life. I also knew that it was the baked-in distance and the impossibility of a date that had allowed me to fall so deeply in the first place. In person, I’m typically so shy in romantic situations that I can barely make eye contact with someone I’ve just met. With her, I felt free to open myself up entirely. Two weeks in, after playing and chatting four to six hours every night, she warned me that she was meeting her father in South Korea the coming weekend and wouldn’t be around to keep up our nightly ritual. It’s strange to miss someone you have never actually met. In the morning, I awoke to a message she had sent from the airport, waiting out a delay. This single message meant more to me than the thousands of others we had exchanged. When I took my first business trip as a single man a few years earlier, I remember wishing I had someone to text from the airport. I had internalized the idea that love is having someone who cares about every utterly benign detail of your travel. “I made it!” I wanted to tap out. “Man, I think I parked in the furthest possible spot.” “The line at security is insane — is it spring break or something?” “Ok, at my gate!” “Boarding!” “Shutting down now, about to take off :).” All those imagined texts with no recipient. It stung even more when my plane touched down several hours later with nobody to tell I’d arrived safely. Our three days “apart” didn’t stall anything. After she returned, we slid right back into our routine of increasingly intimate disclosures. The times we each tried to rescue a hurt animal we came across. The worst thing I did as a kid that I still feel guilty about. Growing up in broken homes. Worst dating experience. Favorite sex position. Ever fake an orgasm? She agreed with me that the biggest commitment either of us could ever make would be combining our libraries, and that we probably shouldn’t take that step until we had at least two kids. One night, I told her my memory is extremely selective: I’ll remember she played the clarinet until sixth grade, yet consistently forget her birthday. It turned out that very day was her birthday. By that point, we had long stopped being surprised at the freakish number of coincidences. Fittingly and as promised, I don’t remember what day that was. Another night, I pre-emptively apologized and told her not to hate me, then played “eutaxies” — a triple word bingo with the “x” on a triple letter for 227 points. She messaged me a considerable growl, and five minutes later I went to bed with a smug grin plastered across my face. I took a screen shot of my play, printed it out and proudly showed my three interns the next day at work. It still hangs in my office today. And then, as I had long feared, something shifted. Two games at once turned into one. Our six-hour chat sessions dwindled to five, then four, then three. Eventually we played a full game without either of us sending a message. At one point, I gathered my courage and asked if I’d said anything wrong. She was quick to assure me I hadn’t. Yes, there were other factors at play. Her teaching break had ended, and she was back at work. That same day, my mother called to tell me her breast cancer had come back and she was having a mastectomy. Three days later, my father ended up in the hospital with a blood clot — a complication from leukemia. Still, if there was ever a week when I could have used six hours of nightly companionship, that was it. We stretched it out for another few weeks, playing a single move per day accompanied by a single chat, neither of us willing to concede the end. One night, I sent her a message thanking her for the last two months, letting her know that however unorthodox it had been, I had loved every minute. She told me she felt exactly the same. One day, we started what would be our final game. We each played a move. The next day, she didn’t play. Nor the day after. Ten days passed before Words With Friends automatically killed the game. The last time I saw her screen name was with the message, “They Timed Out.” Midsummer is when she was due to return to the States, but I don’t know if she ever did. July was also my one-year anniversary in Reno. Yet my happiest memories here have nothing to do with Nevada or the mountains or the university. They are of me sitting on my couch furiously tapping away on a three-inch screen to a woman on the other side of the world, a woman I know both intimately and not at all. I know how she felt when staring into the eyes of a buffalo up close. I know she would love to see “Owl Jeopardy,” where every response starts with “Whoooo.” I know she gets mildly aroused talking about compound miter saws and has a weird thing for hands and likes to sing songs about her cat. But I don’t know what she looks like when she sleeps. I don’t know the sound of her voice or the feel of her hair. I don’t even know her last name.

Drug discovery and development is very expensive; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards, who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries. In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades. How much does it cost to develop approvals?","output":"The text does not provide a specific cost for developing approvals.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In sentence entailment, the truth of one sentence (the conclusion) is directly based on, or entailed by, the truth of another sentence (the premise). In this case, the first sentence, \\"RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SAMPLE REPORT (continued)\\", is a factual statement describing a report, but it does not provide any particular context or expectation for what comes next. It is setting the tone for a further discussion regarding a research and development report but does not suggest anything about any drafts. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"They wanted to write a draft first,\\" is a separate idea. It tells us about an action that a group of people (referred to as \\"they\\") intend to take. This statement could be about any number of things – maybe it's about a report, an essay, a book or any other piece of content that might be drafted – but we don't have any direct information to connect it with the research and development report from the first sentence. A link between the two sentences cannot be assumed, as details like who \\"they\\" refers to and what \\"draft\\" is referring to are missing. An implied connection, for example if the two sentences were included in the same paragraph or context, still wouldn't cause the second sentence to be entailed by the first. It would be a connection based on implication and context, not direct entailment. In conclusion, the second sentence does not follow directly from the first sentence. As such, it's not accurate to say that the second sentence is entailed by the first. Sentence entailment involves a clear cause-and-effect relationship or logical sequence between the two items, and in this case, there is not sufficient information to establish such a relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the Probability that they are both Kings or both Queens? Two cards were drawn, without replacement, from a pack of 52 cards. What is the probability that they are both Kings or both Queen? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, both questions have the same meaning. They are asking for the probability that two cards drawn, without replacement, from a pack of 52 cards are either both Kings or both Queens. Let's calculate the probability step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the total number of possible outcomes. In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, and there is only 1 King and 1 Queen in each suit. Therefore, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in total. Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing the first King or Queen. When we draw the first card, there are 52 cards in the deck, with 8 cards being either Kings or Queens. The probability of drawing a King or a Queen for the first card is: P(K or Q) = 8/52 Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing the same type (King or Queen) as the first card for the second card. a) If we draw a King on the first draw, there are now 51 cards remaining and 3 Kings left in the deck. The probability of drawing the second King is: P(K2|K1) = 3/51 b) If we draw a Queen on the first draw, there are now 51 cards remaining and 3 Queens left in the deck. The probability of drawing the second Queen is: P(Q2|Q1) = 3/51 Step 4: Calculate the overall probability using the conditional probabilities: Both Kings: P(K1 and K2) = P(K1) * P(K2|K1) = (4/52) * (3/51) Both Queens: P(Q1 and Q2) = P(Q1) * P(Q2|Q1) = (4/52) * (3/51) Step 5: Since we want either both Kings or both Queens, we can add the probabilities together: P(Two Kings or Two Queens) = P(K1 and K2) + P(Q1 and Q2) = ((4/52) * (3/51)) + ((4/52) * (3/51)) Step 6: Simplify the probability: P(Two Kings or Two Queens) = ((4 * 3) + (4 * 3)) / (52 * 51) = (12 + 12) / (52 * 51) = 24 / (52 * 51) = 24 / 2652 ≈ 0.00905 So, the probability of drawing two cards that are either both Kings or both Queens is approximately 0.905%."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Prince helped extend phonology with?\\" is in \\"In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\\".

(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Sharon Rocha was expecting her pregnant daughter, Laci Peterson, at dinner on Christmas Eve. Instead, she received a call that Laci was missing. Teams of police and community members scoured the woods and fields near Modesto, California, that night, again on Christmas Day, and for weeks afterward, but there was no sign of her. Four months later, her body washed ashore 90 miles away in the San Francisco Bay. She was 27. But it is Christmas, not springtime, that stirs a deep sadness in Laci Peterson's mother. Every Christmas season brings a reminder that Laci's life and her unborn son's were taken during what should have been a time of joy and anticipation. If anyone knows the pain of celebrating the holidays when they are indelibly connected to tragedy, it is OPTIONS: - CNN. - California. - Christmas. - Christmas Eve. - Laci. - Laci Peterson. - Modesto. - San Francisco Bay. - Scott Peterson. - Sharon Rocha.","output":"The correct answer is:  - Sharon Rocha. Reasoning: The context refers to the tragedy faced by a specific person during the celebration of the holidays, which is related to the loss of her daughter. In the given options, Sharon Rocha is the mother of Laci Peterson who went missing on Christmas Eve and hence is the person profoundly affected by this tragedy. Therefore, \\"Sharon Rocha\\" is the correct answer. Why other answers are wrong: - \\"CNN\\" is a news organization and it doesn't make sense in this context as it cannot celebrate holidays nor associate them with any personal tragedy. - \\"California\\", \\"Modesto\\" and \\"San Francisco Bay\\" are geographical locations. They cannot feel pain or celebrate holidays. - \\"Christmas\\" and \\"Christmas Eve\\" are timeframes or events, not entities capable of emotions or experiences. - \\"Laci\\" and \\"Laci Peterson\\" refer to the person who was tragically lost. However, she is the victim of the tragedy, not the one who is experiencing the pain of celebrating the holidays. - \\"Scott Peterson\\" is Laci Peterson's husband and the convicted murderer. While he might be associated with the tragedy, the question is about the experience of pain during holiday celebrations due to the tragic event, which is more relevant to Sharon Rocha who lost her daughter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya.  - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.  - Christian IV (12 April 1577  28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies.  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.  - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Lysaker is an area in Bærum municipality, Akershus county, Norway. Lysaker is the easternmost part of Bærum, and borders Oslo proper. Lysaker was initially a farming community, later becoming a residential area. Today it is primarily known as a business and trade area, and a public transport hub. It is considered part of Stor-Oslo (Greater Oslo), and is home to offices of numerous domestic and international businesses.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015  25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Prior to becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire.  - Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator . Though based in Lysaker outside Oslo , Norway the company operates in the United States and Brazil .  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited.

The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast.

The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What company does the main Rwandan drink manufacturer license soft drinks from? from the following article ?  The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.

Summarize: London, Reading and Aldershot had the highest wages, according to the report. It suggested the north-south divide is \\"wide as ever\\" and that salaries across the UK have fallen by £1,300 a year. The lack of affordable housing is putting pressure on workers in the South-East of England, it warned. In its annual report, Centre for Cities, highlights the link between low wages and the need to top up people's incomes with welfare benefits. It looked at the UK's 63 largest cities and found that there was a difference of £253 in average weekly incomes from the highest to the lowest paid. But the amount claimed in benefits was roughly the same across the cities covered by the report. Hull had the lowest weekly wage at £376, Blackburn was second at £404 and Blackpool was a little higher at £414. The leader of Hull City Council Stephen Brady said: \\"We understand the need to address and boost skills within knowledge intensive, digital and professional industries.\\" He said the city was seeing high levels of investment from the offshore wind industry and that being named UK City of Culture 2017 would help create new jobs in the region. The cities with the highest salaries were London at £629, Reading at £591, and Aldershot at £571. They also saw the fastest jobs growth. But in the areas where salaries were near the top of the scale, the high cost of housing meant many were still having to claim benefits. The report says the lack of affordable homes means the government's plans to reduce the welfare bill would be difficult to deliver. Only one in four places was delivering a \\"high wage, low welfare\\" economy, the report said. Alexandra Jones, chief executive of Centre for Cities said: \\"One of the most pressing issues is the need to tackle skills gaps and improve school attainment. As well as investment in infrastructure the top priority should be on addressing housing shortages.\\" On a more positive note the report shows that 14 UK cities have hit the target for \\"high-wage, low-welfare\\" economies.  It calls on the government to give local councils more power to invest in employment programmes, which if successful, would reduce their need for benefits. Summary:","output":"The Centre for Cities' annual report reveals that London, Reading, and Aldershot have the highest wages in the UK, but the north-south divide remains significant.

The bars are brightly lit. As Derek heads into the night, the lights from the bars get (A) brighter (B) darker The answer is:","output":"B) darker. As Derek is leaving the bars for the night, the brightly lit environment of the bars slowly transitions to the darker streets outside. The well-lit bars create a vibrant and inviting atmosphere, whereas the night outdoors generally has less lighting, making the area darker when compared to the bars. When people step out of establishments, such as bars or restaurants, which are brightly lit, they often experience a significant difference in the level of light outside. This is particularly true at night when natural sunlight is not available, and artificial lighting varies from area to area. As Derek heads further into the night, he moves away from the concentrated light sources near the bars. Streetlights, neon signs, and other light sources in the area might illuminate the streets, but they usually do not provide the same level of brightness as the indoor lighting of the bars. Moreover, the lighting conditions outside are often affected by several factors, such as the weather, presence of nearby buildings, and the density of light sources in the area. For instance, a foggy or rainy night can make the streets appear even darker by causing light to scatter, reducing the overall visibility. Similarly, if Derek is walking down a street with fewer light sources around, the level of light will decrease, giving a darker impression. In conclusion, as Derek leaves the brightly lit bars, the lights from the bars get darker due to the differing levels of lighting between the indoor and outdoor environments, as well as other factors that may affect the visibility outside. Thus, the correct answer to the question is option B) darker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the shortest field goal kicked in the game?","output":"Title: Shortest Field Goal in NFL History: Discovering the Record-Breaking Moment Introduction Field goals in American football represent an essential part of the game. They have the potential to determine the outcome of a match, rewarding a team with 3 points for successfully launching the ball through the opposing team's goalposts. The National Football League (NFL) has witnessed numerous memorable moments involving field goals, from significant comebacks to agonizing disappointments. In this article, we aim to explore the shortest field goal ever recorded in an NFL game. Step 1: Research the NFL Record Books To understand the shortest field goal ever kicked in an NFL game, we need to dive into the league's record books. Official statistics are available on the official NFL website, allowing us to have credible and reliable data. Step 2: Identify the Record After examining the NFL record books, we discovered the shortest field goal on record: a 6-yard attempt by Jim Turner of the Denver Broncos. This incredible record was set on September 25, 1971, during a match against the Buffalo Bills at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in the 3rd quarter. Step 3: Explain the Context The football game between the Denver Broncos and the Buffalo Bills took place on September 25, 1971, during the 3rd week of the NFL season. The two teams were competing for the eventual playoff spot, and this game played a crucial role in determining their success that year. The 6-yard field goal by Jim Turner occurred in the 3rd quarter of the match. Denver Broncos had a 3rd down and goal from the 4-yard line, which led to a defensive penalty that edged the ball half the distance to the goal line. As a result, the ball was placed 2 yards from the end zone, leading to the record-setting 6-yard field goal attempt. Step 4: Discuss the Aftermath Despite the historical field goal, the Denver Broncos lost the game to the Buffalo Bills with a score of 37-14. However, the legacy of this 6-yard field goal remains intact. In the decades that followed, no player has been able to break or equal this record in the NFL. It serves as a testimony to Jim Turner's skill as a kicker and the unique circumstances that led to this unusual situation. Conclusion The shortest field goal ever kicked in an NFL game is a 6-yard field goal, achieved by Jim Turner of the Denver Broncos in 1971. This record remains unbroken over the past 50 years, standing out among the various accomplishments in the league's history. The fascinating story behind this unique event serves as a reminder of the unpredictable and exciting nature of the game and the records that continue to keep fans engaged and passionate about American football."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a statement and an explanation giving you further knowledge about an entity in the statement.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve for the variable 'j' in the equation -15*j - 57*j - 1470 = 33*j , you'll need to perform some simple algebraic steps.  1. Combine like terms on the left side. Both -15*j and -57*j are like terms because they both contain the variable 'j'. When you add -15*j and -57*j, you get -72*j:      -72*j - 1470 = 33*j. 2. Next, add 72*j to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable on one side. This eliminates -72*j from the left side:     -1470 = 33*j + 72*j. 3. Now, combine like terms again on the right side, by adding 33*j and 72*j:     -1470 = 105*j. 4. The last step is to isolate 'j'. Do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 105:     j = -1470 / 105. Calculate the result:     j = -14.

Continue writing the following text. The countertop was made using plastic instead of wood as the  OPTIONS: * plastic was quite unavailable.; * wood was quite unavailable.;","output":"primary material for counters, wood had become increasingly scarce over the years. In an effort to preserve our planet's precious forests and minimize deforestation, many homeowners and designers have turned to alternative substances for their countertops. One such alternative is plastic. Plastic countertops provide various advantages over traditional wood-based ones. They come in a vast range of designs and colors, which allows homeowners and designers to create countertops that perfectly match the aesthetic of the room and adhere to specific interior design preferences. Additionally, plastic countertops are flexible and can be molded into various shapes to suit the layout and building structure – a feature that wood simply cannot compete with. Moreover, plastic surfaces are easy to maintain and clean. They possess a non-porous surface, which prevents bacteria and other microbes from breeding – making it a hygienic choice for kitchens and other spaces where contamination is a concern. In comparison, wood surfaces have a porous nature that necessitates regular maintenance and treatment to maintain hygiene and prevent germs from seeping in. Another major advantage of plastic countertops over wood is their durability. Despite being lightweight and flexible, plastic surfaces are durable and resistant to scratches, wear, and tear. They can withstand heavy usage, making them an ideal choice for busy households and commercial countertops. In contrast, wood countertops tend to show signs of wear more quickly and require frequent attention to maintain their appearance. Moreover, plastic counters are environmentally friendly. In recent years, advances in technology have enabled manufacturers to utilize recycled plastics to create new and innovative plastic materials. This not only reduces waste and the need for raw materials but also promotes a circular economy. By incorporating plastic countertops into home and commercial designs, individuals can indirectly contribute to reducing their carbon footprint and preserving the environment. In terms of cost, plastic countertops offer remarkable affordability compared to traditional wood or stone options. This makes them more accessible to a wider range of budgets, enabling more individuals to invest in functional and visually appealing countertops without breaking the bank. Despite plastic's various advantages, some detractors argue that wood countertops have a certain warmth and beauty that the alternatives simply cannot replicate. While it's true that wood has its own unique charm, it's essential to weigh the environmental and practical consequences when making a decision. In conclusion, the increasing popularity of plastic countertops is no surprise as the material offers an impressive list of benefits over traditional wood options. Plastic's ease of maintenance, durability, affordability, and environmental friendliness make it a wise choice for those looking to create visually appealing, hygienic, and long-term living and working spaces. It's clear that in an era of limited resources and growing concerns about the environment, plastic countertops present a viable alternative that can accommodate a range of tastes and budgets while safeguarding our planet's valuable wood sources."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(II). engineering knowledge when hiring..","output":"Pat majored in computer engineering and not history because tech employers valued engineering knowledge when hiring. This choice was primarily driven by the fact that the technology industry is continuously evolving and growing at an unprecedented pace. In order to remain competitive in this dynamic market, tech companies constantly seek for individuals who have a strong foundation in engineering principles, as well as the ability to adapt and apply these concepts to new and emerging technologies. Computer engineering, being a discipline that combines both electrical engineering and computer science, offers graduates a comprehensive understanding of the hardware and software components that make up modern computing systems. This background enables them to contribute effectively to the design and development of cutting-edge technologies. Furthermore, computer engineering graduates are well-equipped to troubleshoot, optimize, and maintain these complex systems as the need arises. On the other hand, while history is undoubtedly an important and fascinating subject, its relevance in the context of a tech-oriented job market is considerably limited. Although history can provide valuable insights into the development of technology over time and help to contextualize technological advancements, it is not a primary criteria for employers seeking to hire professionals in the tech industry. In addition to the specific technical skills gained through a computer engineering degree, employers in the technology sector often look for candidates who possess soft skills such as problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and adaptability. Graduates from computer engineering programs tend to have experience working on collaborative projects, internships, and other real-world applications that help to develop and hone these sought-after traits. Moreover, when considering long-term career prospects, computer engineering graduates often find that their specialized skills open up numerous opportunities for growth and advancement. From software development and systems analysis to artificial intelligence and robotics, their education provides a solid foundation that can be further developed and adapted to suit a wide range of roles within the tech industry. In conclusion, Pat's decision to major in computer engineering rather than history was influenced by the increased value and emphasis that tech employers place on engineering knowledge when hiring. As the technology sector continues to expand, computer engineering graduates are well-positioned to capitalize on the multitude of opportunities that arise, ultimately leading to exciting and rewarding careers in the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed? is inside the article: The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram.

The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the label, and making a name for themselves locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held in and around Boston. The 2004 single \\"Tessie\\" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest charting singles to date. The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's \\"The Warrior's Code\\", included the song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"; the song was featured in the 2006 Academy Award-winning movie \\"The Departed\\", and went on to become the band's only Platinum-selling single to date, and remains one of their best-known songs. The band is known for their loud, energetic live shows.  - Charged GBH, commonly known as GBH, are an English street punk band which was formed in 1978 by vocalist Colin Abrahall, guitarist Colin \\"Jock\\" Blyth, bassist Sean McCarthy (replaced by Ross Lomas by the time they had signed to Clay records) and Drummer Andy \\"Wilf\\" Williams. GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \\"UK82\\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement. A retroactive label, the musicians involved were not originally associated with each other, coming from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes.  - Cock Sparrer is a punk rock band formed in 1972 (but didn't release an album until 78) in the East End of London, England. Although they have never enjoyed commercial success, they are considered one of the most influential street punk bands of all time, helping pave the way for early 80's punk scene and the Oi! subgenre. Their songs have been covered by many punk, Oi!, and hardcore bands.  - Viking is the second and final studio album by the American punk rock band Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards .  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Anti-Heros were an American Oi!/street punk band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. They took a hiatus from 19891993, but continued to record and play concerts through the early 2000s. Anti-Heros are one of the first and most popular American Oi! bands. The original lineup consisted of Mark Noah (vocals), Mike Jones (bass), Phil Solomon (drums) and Joe Winograd (guitar). The band released two records on Link Records in the late 1980s, \\"That's Right!\\" (produced by John Blackwell) in 1987 and \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" (produced by John Blackwell) in 1988.

Hellcat Records, like many independent labels, also embraces the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) ethos common in punk culture. In addition, Lars Frederiksen has a personal relationship with Hellcat Records beyond his role as a musician. As a record producer, he has produced albums for several bands associated with the label. This includes working with bands like The Business, Agnostic Front, and the Dropkick Murphys, who were signed to Hellcat Records for the release of some of their albums, reinforcing the connection between Frederiksen and the label.  Thus, the album \\"Viking\\" by Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards is related to Hellcat Records as the record label that released it, reflecting the interconnected nature of artists, their works, and their labels within the music industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Disgraced ex-Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette - who wrote a first hand account of the mission to kill Osama bin Laden - allegedly 'recruited' other fellow SEALs to provide classified information to the makers of popular video game 'Medal of Honor: Warfighter'. Senior Navy officials confirmed today that seven members of the secretive SEAL Team Six, of which Bissonnette was a member, have been disciplined for providing classified information to Electronic Arts. Spending two days as paid consultants for the game-makers, the SEALS were punished for the latest embarrassing leak involving the elite special forces unit  with letters of reprimand and forfeited their pay for two months but will not face jail time. Four other SEALs, all based on the West Coast, are also under investigation for similar alleged violations, one other official said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Privileged information: Some Navy SEALs are in trouble for showing the creators classified documents. Seven members of the secretive Navy SEALs (pictured left) including one involved in the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, have been punished for disclosing classified information to a video game maker (right) According to CBS News, it was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book - published under the pseudonym Mark Owen - that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal. 'As they were looking into his book deal, the money, whether he violated the non-disclosure agreements he signed ... what they ended up learning is that 11 Navy SEALs had been brought in allegedly by Owen into this deal with a video company for the production of Medal of Honor: Warfighter, a Navy SEALs-based video game,' said CBS Senior Correspondent and former assistant director of National Intelligence John Miller. This issue raised the same concerns as Bissonnette's book. 'There was no notification of their commanding officer, no waivers signed...none of the boxes had been checked.' One serious point for U.S. Defense chief's is the possibility that classified information - known as 'Tactics, Techniques and Procedures' or TTPS - can be picked up by Somalia pirates or indeed terrorists just by playing what should be a simple video game. 'What do the warfighters do, what tricks do they use, how do they work?' said Miller. 'I guess if you stretch it there you could say that if you played that video game enough based on real Navy SEALs knowledge, you could learn to counter some of those TTPs.' The worry for Pentagon chiefs is if the 11 SEALs in total divulged information on equipment and tactics that could be used against the elite fighting force. The popular video game boasts that was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.' In fact, according to Miller, the good publicity that came from the succesful bin Laden raid is now backfiring on the elite and secretive unit. 'The special operations community looks on this as too much of a good thing,' said Miller. 'They have run into the Facebook generation - they are used to living out loud, used to talking as individuals. they are used to it being all about me and that's a conflict.' Each of the seven received a punitive letter of reprimand- which generally prevents individuals from being promoted- and a partial forfeiture of pay for two months. The deputy commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Garry Bonelli, issued a statement acknowledging that nonjudicial punishments had been handed out for misconduct, but he did not offer any details. 'We do not tolerate deviations from the policies that govern who we are and what we do as sailors in the United States Navy,' Bonelli said. He alluded to the importance of honoring nondisclosure agreements that SEALs sign. He said the punishments this week 'send a clear message throughout our force that we are and will be held to a high standard of accountability.' Navy SEALs (pictured) have entered into the public consciousness since the legendary Team Six conducted their successful raid on Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May of 2011. Secrets: One of the scenarios in the game is based on a real battle with Somali pirates. The two main complaints against the SEALs were that they did not seek the permission of their command to take part in the video game project and that they showed the video designers some of their specially designed combat equipment unique to their unit, said a senior military official. The official was briefed about the case but was not authorized to speak publicly about it. In the actual game promotional materials Electronic Arts claimed that it was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.' It adds that give 'players a view into globally recognised threats...letting them experience the action as it might have unfolded.' Tier 1 Operator is a military term for units involved in the most sensitive and classified operations. While Pentagon officials refused to discuss the exact nature of the information the SEALs allegedly gave away, the leak is just the latest in a series since the May 2nd 2011 bin Laden raid. Last year the White House itself was involved when the administration was accused of improperly disclosing details of the mission to the New York Times for political gain. Worrying: Several Navy SEALs have been pulled off active duty to deal with the fallout from the controversial book about the killing of Osama bin Laden. And then infamously, this fall, Pentagon officials began an investigation after the publication of 'No Easy Day' which is a first person account of the bin Laden raid by former SEAL Team Six member, Matt Bissonnette. Matt Bissonnette, who participated in. the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, but later retired from the SEALs, published his book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, but he landed. in hot water with the Pentagon even before it was published in. September. The Pentagon. accused him of disclosing classified information in violation of the. nondisclosure agreements he had signed as a SEAL. He disputes the. charge. Matt Bissonnette - The  Navy SEAL Team 6 member who used the pseudonym Mark Owen to write No Easy Day. Watching: In this undated image from video. seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV. programme showing an image of President Obama. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad. compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the. Situation Room of the White House. While they have not taken any formal action against him, the Pentagon have said they are looking at their legal options. The SEAL mission to capture or kill Laden, while stunningly successful, encountered a number of unexpected obstacles, including the loss of a stealthy helicopter that was partially blown up by the SEALs after making a hard landing inside bin Laden's compound. The head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, responded to the Bissonnette book by telling his force that 'hawking details about a mission' and selling other information about SEAL training and operations puts the force and their families at risk. SEALs, both active duty and retired, possess highly sensitive information about tactics and techniques that are central to the success of their secret and often dangerous missions overseas. That is why they are obliged to sign nondisclosure agreements when they enter service and when they leave, and it is why the Pentagon seeks to enforce such written agreements. The punishments were first reported by CBS News.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Problem:look opposite left thrice after look opposite left twice Solution:","output":"To execute the command \\"look opposite left thrice after look opposite left twice\\", we will break it down into smaller actions: 1. \\"look opposite left twice\\": To look opposite left twice, the agent will first have to turn left by 180 degrees, which can be achieved by performing two left turns. Then, it will look, and finally turn back to the original direction by performing two left turns again. This process is repeated two times because of the word \\"twice\\". Actions for this part:  I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT 2. \\"look opposite left thrice\\": Similar to the previous part, but this time, the agent will repeat the process three times because of the word \\"thrice\\". Actions for this part:  I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT Since we need to execute \\"look opposite left thrice\\" after \\"look opposite left twice\\", we combine the actions from both parts sequentially: Solution:  I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_LOOK, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The short-term gratification might be overwhelming, but it's really not good in the long run.  Acne is a bacteria that lives in your pores. Popping the pimple gives the acne a chance to spread over the skin to other pores, infecting them. Popping pimples causes inflammation and may lead to scarring. So if you want your acne to be less visible, resist the urge to pop. Stop before you pop. Washing your face is good: try to wash once in the morning and once at night. But over-washing your face can cause further irritation and unnecessarily dry out the skin. Washing your face over and over again will not give you a better shot at treating your acne. Your skin is an organ in your body, just like your kidney. Like your kidney, it needs to be fed with water and moisture to function properly. That's where moisturizing comes in. After every time you wash your face, moisturize. Different skin types call for different moisturizers. Cream-based moisturizers are probably more effective for dry skin, as they tend to be oily. Gel-based moisturizers are better for oily skin, as they disperse more evenly on the skin. Preferably the kind that doesn't irritate your skin, but still protects you from sun damage. Acne can be made worse by overexposure to the sun and by sun damage, making this an easy proposition. For better-looking skin, wear sunscreen. These things may seem to have nothing to do with the quality of your skin, but they in fact have a very meaningful relationship with quality of skin.  Doctors don't exactly know why, but stress worsens acne. When stress is produced in humans, the hormones that regulate sebum, an excess of which produces acne, stop working as well. So find healthy ways to reduce stress in your life and see your skin get better! The more you sleep, the less stress you put your body through. You have about 15% more stress for every hour of sleep you lose per night. And we just learned that stress causes acne. So get those ZZZs and see your acne improve. Exercise is a healthy way to give stress an outlet. Plain and simple, it's harder to be stressed when we're all tuckered out. So join a gym, play an intramural sport, or start running on your own. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter version of a longer text that includes the main ideas and important details. So, for this article, a summary would be: Natural remedies can help with acne, but it's important not to pop pimples, because it can make them worse and leave scars.

Scott was born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, North East England, the youngest of three sons of Elizabeth (nee Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy Scott (who served in the Royal Engineers). He followed in his elder brother's footsteps, studying at Grangefield School, West Hartlepool College of Art and graduating from Sunderland Art School with a fine arts degree. At the age of 16 he appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his 23-year-old brother Ridley. Scott studied art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London at his first attempt. On 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm. PDT, Scott killed himself by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division found contact information in a note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness said he did not hesitate before jumping, but another said he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds, and jumping into the water beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.  On 22 October 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office announced the cause of death as \\"multiple blunt force injuries.\\" Therapeutic levels of mirtazapine and eszopiclone were in his system at the time of death. Both drugs have been known to cause suicidal thoughts or ideation.

Tony was feeling very, very unhappy, in a way that is hard to understand. People around him didn't exactly know why he was so sad.

His brother later also said he was quietly fighting with a bad sickness called cancer. But nobody knows exactly why he chose to do what he did.

Next question: when did fast and furious 7 start filming?","output":"Fast & Furious 7, also known as Furious 7, began principal photography and started filming on September 9, 2013. The production of this high-octane action film, directed by James Wan, had to overcome several obstacles and complexities during the filming process. The film starred an ensemble cast, including late actor Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, and Jason Statham. The shooting locations spanned across various parts of the United States and internationally, such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo. Some notable scenes included car chases, shootouts, and, most memorably, the famous car jump between skyscrapers in Abu Dhabi. Tragically, on November 30, 2013, lead actor Paul Walker passed away in an unrelated car accident in Santa Clarita, California, which significantly impacted the filming timeline and methodology. The production team halted the filming temporarily to cope with the devastating loss and to devise a plan to continue the movie without Walker while still honoring his memory. Following Walker's untimely passing, the script underwent multiple revisions, and the original release date, scheduled for July 11, 2014, was inevitably postponed. In January 2014, Universal Studios announced that the revised release date would be April 3, 2015. The production resumed in April 2014, and innovative techniques were employed to honor Paul Walker's role in the film. Stand-in actors, digital facial reconstructions, and even Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, were brought in to complete his unfinished scenes. The collaboration between the Walker brothers and the production team marked an emotional tribute. Ultimately, Furious 7 premiered on March 16, 2015, at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, and it was met with immense commercial success and positive critical reception. The film has since stood as a testament to the dedication of its cast and crew, along with being a fitting tribute to Paul Walker, who was an integral part of the Fast & Furious franchise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Steven applied for the position of Bingo Caller while Derrick did not because","output":"he felt that his introverted nature and lack of enthusiasm for engaging with large crowds would deter him from efficiently performing the role. Steven, on the other hand, was a highly extroverted individual who thrived in social situations, making him an ideal candidate for this position. His innate ability to build rapport with practically anyone he encountered, combined with his unique charisma and charm, allowed Steven to project a very appealing and compelling presence. As a Bingo Caller, he would be responsible for maintaining the seamless flow of the game, calling out numbers in an entertaining and engaging manner, and stimulating a lively atmosphere that kept participants coming back for more. Derrick, who was more comfortable working behind-the-scenes, understood that he wouldn't be able to match Steven's level of energy and animated demeanor towards such a role. While Derrick admired Steven's outgoing personality, he knew that finding a suitable position that aligned with his own set of strengths and interests was of equal importance. Unbeknownst to him, Derrick would soon discover his passion for graphic design, which would catapult him into a successful career of visual communication and storytelling. In this new path, he would play a crucial yet subtle role in the world of Bingo; designing the promotional material and adverts for various Bingo events. As the visual mastermind behind numerous eye-catching posters and vibrant digital content, Derrick's skills eventually became sought-after within the industry. Steven flourished as an exceptional Bingo Caller for the next several years, winning numerous awards in the process and earning the praise of guests and colleagues alike. During this time, he and Derrick ran into each other at a Bingo convention, recognizing each other from their high school days. The once classmates then rekindled their friendship and began collaborating, with Steven enlisting Derrick's design skills to create captivating ads for his events, while Derrick started attending Steven's energetic bingo sessions to witness first-hand the impact of his designs. In a twist of fate, Derrick, who had initially shied away from a more extroverted on-stage role, now found himself immersed in the world of Bingo, creating stunning visuals that lured enthusiasts from near and far. Both their careers flourished through this synergistic partnership, and the duo credited their individual success to respecting their unique strengths while embracing their differences. Encouraging one another, Steven’s lively sessions as a Bingo Caller and Derrick’s artistic contributions came together seamlessly, making a dynamic impact in the world of Bingo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Enriched cages, which have replaced battery cages, are not ideal but produce better conditions than some free-range farms, said Prof Christine Nicol of Bristol University. Not all free-range farms meet standards consumers expect, she added. Other research contradicts this, said Humane Society International. About 50% of UK hens are now housed in enriched cages. The cages, which contain more space for birds, including a perch and nest area, typically contain around 90 hens and are stacked on top of each other in tiers. Researchers at Bristol University compared the welfare of laying hens kept in different farming conditions, including battery cages (which have been phased out in the EU), enriched (or furnished) cages, barn systems and free-range. Professor of animal welfare, Christine Nicol, said enriched cages performed better on animal welfare measures than some free-range farms. \\"I'm not saying it's great, there's still a lot of room for improvement but the birds have space, they've got a little perch, they've got things they can scratch on,\\" she said. \\"And the welfare measures that we take show that these birds had fewer fractures, they had much lower mortality, they had lower stress levels, they did less damaging pecking to each other than the birds on the smaller free-range systems.\\" She said the battery cage was completely unacceptable and was right to be banned. \\"The furnished cage that's replaced it at the moment gives the best welfare outcome but it is also limited, it is not the best system that there could be at all, and there's very little that you can do to improve the furnished cage further. \\"And it would be nice to think that the free-range system currently gave birds the best welfare. The problem is that the management of free range systems in the UK at the moment is so variable, that although you get some brilliant farms, you also get some that are really really not good.\\" She said the challenge for the hen industry was realising the potential of the free-range system \\"so that they actually do what consumers think they do which is provide all hens with good welfare\\". Prof Nicol said the study from 2010 had been supported by more recent research. However, Chetana Mirle, director of farm animal welfare for Humane Society International, said other research had produced conflicting results. She said proper management of hens was essential in any environment to stop troublesome behaviours such as hen pecking. But she said there was not enough space in enriched cages to allow birds to perch adequately or run and jump. \\"In a furnished cage system unlike a barn or a free-range system the animal doesn't have the ability to express their natural behaviour in the way they need to,\\" she told BBC News. \\"A number of behaviours that are natural to a hen are not possible in a furnished cage system - that's an important indicator to look at.\\" Robert Gooch of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association said the most important criterion in bird welfare was allowing birds to express their natural behaviour. \\"There are many criteria of bird welfare,\\" he said. \\"The leading one is that birds should be able to express their natural behaviour and hence why free range and organic systems have been developed so birds can do that.\\" He said birds in free-range environments were exposed to risks such as predation by foxes or could injure themselves flapping from perches, which could account for injuries found in research studies.

Sometimes, in a hurry, you may click the Delete option provided in the Nikon Coolpix camera.\\" Allow me to elaborate more on this given scenario. The situation described involves the removal of unwanted or unnecessary photos from your camera or its memory card. This is a common task for photographers or individuals who like to capture many photos, as it helps free up some space for taking more pictures. This operation is typically performed when your camera's or memory card's memory space is nearing its capacity.  However, in conducting this task, there's a risk as well. There might be situations where you accidentally delete some of the photos you never intended to remove. And these aren't just any ordinary photos – but photos that hold memorable or sentimental value to you. It's even more regrettable if these photos are irreplaceable, such as those from special events, trips, celebrations, or milestones. The instance portrayed points specifically to hurried situations, where you might haphazardly select the delete feature on the Nikon Coolpix camera. The Nikon Coolpix series, like many cameras, has an intuitive interface with options for deleting images. However, during hastened photo removal, you might not thoroughly check the photos before deleting them. As a result, valuable images could inadvertently be selected and deleted in the process. Consequently, you might realize it later and regret the unfortunate mistake. Therefore, it's always advisable to take extra caution when deleting images from your camera, especially in situations where you are in a rush. You should spend some time reviewing each photo before deciding to delete it, ensuring you don't accidentally remove photos you wish to keep. Plus, partnering this methodical practice with regular backups of your photos – either on a physical drive or a cloud service – can further minimize the risk of losing precious memories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Criterion and criteria are related terms but have a key difference in their usage due to their grammatical number. Criterion refers to a singular principle, standard, or rule serving as a basis for judging, evaluating, or selecting something, while criteria are the plural form of criterion, meaning multiple principles, standards, or rules used for the same purpose.  These two questions are indeed asking the same thing in that they both seek to understand the difference between a single standard (criterion) and multiple standards (criteria). However, since \\"a criteria\\" is grammatically incorrect, the second question should be rephrased to: \\"What is the difference between criteria and a criterion?\\" This would more accurately convey the intended meaning. To further illustrate the difference between criterion and criteria, let's use an example: When evaluating job applicants for a specific position, there may be several criteria (plural) used to judge their suitability, such as experience, education, and skills. These individual principles or standards can each be referred to as a criterion (singular). For instance, \\"Jane met the experience criterion for the job by having five years of work in the field.\\" On the other hand, when evaluating other specific elements, you could say, \\"The company considered the criteria of experience, education, and skills to find the best candidate.\\" In summary, criterion and criteria have the same general meaning, but criterion refers to a singular principle or standard, while criteria denote multiple principles or standards used for judging, evaluating, or selecting something.

Samsung will buy LoopPay, a mobile payments company that let's people pay for goods using their phones. It is expected to reveal the service on March 1st, when it launches its new Galaxy S6 handset. LoopPay (left) calls itself a 'wallet solution' that lets customers pay with their phones and tablets 'virtually everywhere'. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. If the firms do partner up, LoopPay's technology could be built into Samsung phones (Galaxy S5 pictured right), tablets and watches. LoopPay calls itself a 'wallet solution' that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets 'virtually everywhere'. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. These can be used to pay for shopping in 90% of shops and banks in the US. Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader. LoopPay's technology allows mobile payments through traditional magnetic credit card readers, so it can theoretically work in a lot more places than Apple Pay, which requires special payment pads to work. Samsung did not say how much it's paying to buy LoopPay. 'Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced that it has agreed to acquire LoopPay, the acclaimed mobile wallet solutions provider that turns existing magnetic stripe readers into secure, contactless receivers,' the firm said. LoopPay's technology has the potential to work in approximately 90% of existing point-of-sale (POS) terminals. 'This acquisition accelerates our vision to drive and lead innovation in the world of mobile commerce. Our goal has always been to build the smartest, most secure, user-friendly mobile wallet experience, and we are delighted to welcome LoopPay to take us closer to this goal,' said JK Shin, President and Head of IT and Mobile Division at Samsung Electronics. As part of the acquisition, LoopPay founders and veteran payment industry entrepreneurs Will Graylin and George Wallner will work closely with Samsung's Mobile Division. Samsung has an existing relationship with LoopPay, having first identified the potential for the pioneering technology when it became a strategic investor along with Visa and Synchrony Financial. 'We are excited to take our relationship with LoopPay to the next level, by bringing consumers a mobile wallet solution that is not just safe and reliable, but also widely accepted at more locations than any competing service,' said David Eun, EVP of Samsung's Global Innovation Center. 'LoopPay's outstanding leaders and team have deep-rooted relationships with banks, card networks and merchants that will complement those Samsung has established over the years.' 'LoopPay is focused on delivering a digital wallet solution that is dependable for consumers around the world, one that provides more value from card issuers and the merchants that serve them,' said Will Graylin, CEO of LoopPay. Never one to be outdone by its biggest competitor, Samsung is now looking to launch its own mobile payment service to rival Apple Pay (pictured at its launch with Tim Cook). Sources said the Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones. Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. 'We are excited to join the Samsung family to continue our goal of making smartphones trusted, secure smart wallets and unlock the limitless possibilities of mobile enabled commerce.' Late last year, sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay. Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely. LoopPay calls itself a 'wallet solution' that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets 'virtually everywhere'. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a specially-designed phone case. The sources revealed that Samsung is already in talks with the Massachusetts-based provider, and prototypes have been created, but there is no word on when the service will launch - if at all. The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. These can be used to pay for shopping in 90 per cent of shops and banks in the US. Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road. Mail truck. Must be time for breakfast. About time I ate something. Question: Why was Justin's face like leather? Answer: A:","output":"Justin's face was like leather due to years of exposure to harsh environmental conditions and manual labor. As a rancher or farmer, he likely spent a significant amount of time outdoors under the sun and in all kinds of weather. This constant, long-term exposure to sunlight, wind, and dust leads to skin damage, which results in a leather-like texture on the skin, particularly on the face. Additionally, as people age, their skin naturally loses elasticity and becomes more susceptible to wrinkles and toughening, which could have also contributed to Justin's leathered appearance. These factors combined explain why Justin's face had a leather-like quality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:It was a notable moment for Steve Paterson, part of a story that began with a £10,000 cash inducement before he fell into gambling, a drinking problem and now, a sense of having come out the other side to a place of serenity. \\"I've been at the highest level and now it's almost like I've returned to my roots,\\" Paterson says. \\"That makes me happy.\\" The arrival of Tommy Docherty in an expensive car in the small Moray village of Mostodloch in 1974 would have caught the attention of locals, although Paterson was already well known at home and beyond. He made his Scotland Under-18 debut while only 15 and after playing against England at Old Trafford his signature was widely chased. Media playback is not supported on this device Paterson was drawn to the history and romanticism of Manchester United, although he insisted on completing his education before moving south. By that time, he was already an enthusiastic gambler. \\"[It] began about a year before, when I got money from Man United,\\" he says. \\"It was laid out in £10 notes in the middle of my living room and my mother and father - pretty working class, just managed to pay the rent and get a couple of screw tops on a Saturday and fags - couldn't cope with the sum of money and left it to me. \\"It was £10,000, a huge amount. I stuffed it in a big Bisto tin and kept it in my mother's wardrobe. I started to dip into it. \\"The club should have put it into a trust to get at the end of your contract, but it was a long time ago. And it would have been illegal. Back then, the top schoolboys were getting bunged, that was the norm, but I was naive and I'd have signed for nothing.\\" The game's culture at the time offered no protection from his personal demons. At Old Trafford, the youth players spent their afternoons playing snooker or gambling. Attending the Wednesday afternoon drinking club was expected. \\"I fell into the bookie and racing gang,\\" Paterson says ruefully. \\"If I had to change anything, it would be that.\\" He left Old Trafford in 1980, with a move to Sheffield United eventually falling through because of an injury, followed by spells in Hong Kong, Australia and Japan, before a return to Moray, his \\"comfort blanket\\". Back home, Paterson ended up as player-manager of Elgin, embarking on the next chapter of his football career. \\"I couldn't do anything but win for the first 10 years of my [management] career, yet off the park I wasn't putting in anything,\\" Paterson says. \\"I wasn't into the theory and science of the game. I had a good eye for a player.\\" His finest hour and a half came at Celtic Park in February 2000, when he steered Inverness Caledonian Thistle to a 3-1 Scottish Cup victory over Celtic. At the time, Paterson was considered one of the most promising managers operating outside the top-flight, but the success was in spite of an increasingly chaotic personal life. \\"I got away with an awful lot of things at Inverness,\\" Paterson says. \\"Some of my behaviour was shocking. I let a lot of people down, none more so than myself. \\"I was very much into gambling. I was very much into drinking. But I pulled off the football because you can put on a mask and function when inside you're in turmoil. \\"I was a runaway train, an accident waiting to happen and unfortunately it happened when I got the biggest job of my life.\\" Paterson joined Aberdeen in December 2002, but within three months the addictions in his personal life finally spilled over into his professional one, and he failed to turn up for a game against Dundee following a night of heavy drinking. Aberdeen stood by him, but he was eventually sacked at the end of the 2003-04 season, and left Pittodrie in the boot of a car to avoid the waiting press. \\"I had a drink problem whereby I never knew when to stop,\\" he says. \\"It's the biggest regret of my life and I firmly believe I should have been sacked right away. I've never been back to Pittodrie because I feel ashamed. \\"If [Aberdeen] had done a bit more research they would maybe have had second thoughts, but I was so successful and in days gone by, it was fairly common that a lot of managers would have a drink or gambling problem. \\"For the next five years I lost the plot, my behaviours escalated in terms of irresponsible drinking and gambling. I hit a few years of clinical depression.\\" Paterson spent two months at the Sporting Chance clinic in 2008 and wrote a book about his life that was in many ways a confession. Even then, it took longer to fully cope with his addictions. Football, though, was a constant, with Paterson managing Forres Mechanics, Peterhead, Huntly, Formartine United and now Dufftown since leaving Aberdeen, combined with his job as a social worker. \\"I was very much into self-pity and I had loads of really bad character defects,\\" he says. \\"It's only the last few years that I've grown a bit. When you're in the grip of an addiction, your emotional growth is stunted. \\"My life has been really good [now] and I feel at peace. I've changed a lot for the better. My ambitions and aims now all revolve around my family and friends and my partner. I'm in a good place. \\"I played for a wee village team called Fochabers and I'm now managing Dufftown, which is a lovely wee club. I've come a full circle.\\" Listen to the full interview with Steve Paterson on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound on Thursday evening, from 18:30 BST. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article revolves around the life and career of Steve Paterson, a former football player and manager who faced numerous challenges due to his gambling and drinking problem. Paterson started his career at a young age, receiving a £10,000 cash inducement from Manchester United which he admits led to his inexperienced handling of money and the beginning of his gambling addiction. Despite success on the field and a promising career, Paterson's personal problems took a toll, leading to his dismissal from Aberdeen in 2004. After years of dealing with addiction and depression, Paterson attended the Sporting Chance clinic and began a journey of healing and reflection. Currently, he works as a social worker and football manager for Dufftown, finding solace and happiness in his life by focusing on family, friends, and his partner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Encephalitis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the brain caused by viruses, has claimed several lives and left numerous others debilitated. With limited resources and a strained healthcare system, Nepal desperately seeks funds to fight this deadly disease and safeguard the health of its citizens. Step 1: Address the Seriousness of the Situation Encephalitis poses a significant threat to the population, particularly to children and individuals with compromised immune systems. It is crucial to raise awareness about the severity of the situation and emphasize the need for urgent action to prevent further damage to the affected region. Step 2: Explain the Causes and Symptoms A comprehensive understanding of the causes and symptoms of encephalitis is vital for prevention and control measures. The Japanese encephalitis virus, transmitted through mosquito bites, has been identified as the primary cause of the outbreak. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, seizures, and eventual coma or death if left untreated. Identifying these signs early can help seek timely medical intervention. Step 3: Examine the Current State of Healthcare The healthcare system in Nepal is overburdened and under-resourced, which makes it challenging to manage the increasing number of encephalitis patients. A significant portion of the population resides in rural areas with limited access to advanced healthcare facilities, exacerbating the problem. Financial support is essential to improve diagnostic capabilities and treatment options. Step 4: Outline the Proposed Solutions To effectively combat encephalitis, Nepal needs adequate funding for implementing the following solutions: 1. Strengthening the surveillance system: This will enable the early detection of encephalitis cases and curtail the spread of the disease. 2. Enhancing healthcare infrastructure: Improving healthcare facilities and equipment, particularly in rural areas, would increase the accessibility and quality of care for encephalitis patients. 3. Training healthcare professionals: Equip medical workers with the knowledge and skills necessary to identify, treat, and manage encephalitis cases. 4. Launching public awareness campaigns: Educate the public on preventive measures such as maintaining proper hygiene, using mosquito repellents, and getting vaccinated. Conclusion: The outbreak of encephalitis jeopardizes the lives and well-being of countless individuals in Nepal. By providing financial assistance, it is possible to implement targeted strategies and solutions that can contain the spread of the disease, while also improving the overall healthcare landscape in the country. As the battle against encephalitis intensifies, concerted efforts from global organizations, governments, and citizens can undoubtedly make a difference in curbing this devastating illness and safeguarding the future of Nepal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Elysium A:","output":"Title: Elysium Enterprise Genre: Science Fiction, Action, Drama Plot: In the year 2125, Earth's dwindling resources and overpopulation have forced humanity to look for sustainable alternatives. Elysium Enterprise, a visionary company, successfully creates a colossal space habitat called Elysium, orbiting Earth at a safe but reachable distance. Elysium is an engineering marvel, housing millions of people and providing a haven for humankind where Earth-like conditions are replicated in a controlled environment. The inhabitants, called Elysians, have access to the best technology, healthcare, and education. However, with the limited space, only a privileged few can enjoy life on Elysium, mainly the wealthy and powerful. Down below on Earth, life has become almost uninhabitable. Tech-savvy marine biologist, Dr. Lydia Evans, resides in one of Earth’s few remaining livable zones, striving to find a way to reverse the planet's catastrophic state. She discovers classified information that points to a conspiracy perpetrated by Elysium Enterprise's CEO, Alexander Kane, whose ultimate goal is to monopolize life on Elysium for his elites while exploiting Earth's remaining resources for profit. Lydia, together with her former love interest, Noah, a skilled pilot who shares her passion for saving Earth, infiltrates Elysium in search of incriminating evidence that will expose Kane's sinister plot. Their mission proves challenging as they must blend with the Elysians, who hold deeply engrained prejudices against Earth-dwellers. As Lydia and Noah navigate the treacherous world of Elysium, they discover an underground movement led by Robin, a charismatic Elysian engineer, who understands the problems facing Earth and shares the same objective as the duo - to seek justice for those on Earth and reshape the future of humanity. Robin has valuable evidence that Elysium is drawing Earth's resources at a disastrous rate, creating an irreversible tipping point for Earth. Together, they work to expose Alexander Kane's scheme and gain the support of sympathetic Elysians. Faced with mounting adversities, they put their lives at risk in an audacious bid to broadcast the evidence to the citizens of Elysium, sparking an uprising that leads to a revolution. In the climactic confrontation, Alexander Kane is defeated, and alternative leadership takes control, promising fundamental policy changes. Ultimately, Lydia and the revolutionaries devise long-term strategies to alter the course of Earth's demise, including a plan to rejuvenate the planet and unite Elysium and Earth as partners. In the end, the story leaves us with a hopeful future where collaboration, empathy, and technological advancements give humanity a fighting chance at a sustainable existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room.  Are the electrons in the small sign more or less energized than the large sign's electrons? A:","output":"To determine if the electrons in the small sign are more or less energized than the large sign's electrons, we need to consider the information given and analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. Both neon signs are plugged into the wall, which means they should both have access to the electrical power needed to energize the electrons. 2. When Kathy flips the light switch, only the large sign lights up. This means that the large sign's electrons are being energized by the electric current, causing them to jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light, which is visible. 3. The small sign doesn't light up, despite being plugged in. This could indicate a few possibilities: a faulty connection, a malfunctioning power supply or transformer, or some other issue preventing the electric current from reaching the small sign's electrons. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the electrons in the small sign are currently less energized than the large sign's electrons. This is because the small sign's electrons are not being exposed to an electric current, and therefore not jumping to a higher energy level and emitting light. However, this could change if the underlying issue preventing the small sign from lighting up is resolved and an electric current is able to energize its electrons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The aroma of the hot meal waiting for them filled the air, and everyone couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort that was much needed after the tumultuous evening they had all experienced. Once the table was set, everyone took their seats, Josephine began serving the meal. She had prepared a soul-nourishing feast of roast chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and warm dinner rolls. The group eagerly dug into their plates, savoring every single bite. As they ate, they began to share their individual experiences during the chaotic events that had unfolded earlier. The stories filled with fear, uncertainty, and courage as they spoke about helping others, hiding together for safety, and the eventual relief when they realized that everyone had emerged unharmed. Doris chimed in with stories of her own – how she had rushed to the aid of a scared family and how she had joined Josephine in the church to pray for everyone's safety. She mentioned the clergy members and other volunteers who opened the church doors as a sanctuary for those who were frightened and seeking refuge. After their meal, the group gathered in the living room, where they continued sharing stories late into the night, cherishing the camaraderie and rediscovering their gratitude for the blessings in their lives. The events of the evening had demonstrated to them how fragile life could be and how important it was to cherish their relationships and support one another. It also reinforced the fact that their community was built on a strong foundation of love, trust, and resilience – a realization that brought them closer than ever. As the night turned into the early hours of the morning, the weary group finally decided it was time to say goodbye and head back to their homes. They departed with tight embraces and promises to keep in touch and look out for each other in the days to come.

Q: My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her. According to the above context, answer the following question. What was Grandmother, Rosemary's dream?

A bromate is a chemical compound that contains this ion. Examples of bromates include sodium bromate,, and potassium bromate,.  - An oxoacid is an acid that contains oxygen. Specifically, it is a compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, with at least one hydrogen atom bound to oxygen that can dissociate to produce the H cation and the anion of the acid.  - Bromic acid, also known as hydrogen bromate, is an oxoacid with the molecular formula HBrO. It only exists in aqueous solution. It is a colorless solution that turns yellow at room temperature as it decomposes to bromine. Bromic acid and bromates are powerful oxidizing agents and are common ingredients in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  - Calcium bromate , Ca ( BrO3 ) 2 , is a salt of bromic acid and lime . It may be prepared by the anodic oxidation of calcium bromide . It is used as a flour improver ( E number E924b ) in some countries .  - Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with physical systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium but can adequately be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.  - Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"stench\\", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.  - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'calcium bromate' with the relationship of 'instance of'.  Choices: - acid  - anion  - branch  - cation  - chemical  - chemical compound  - chemical element  - chloride  - edifice  - formula  - hydrogen  - ion  - liquid  - may  - molecular formula  - number  - oxoacid  - salt  - solution  - state  - system  - temperature  - transport  - water The answer is:","output":"chemical compound"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work.  The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

Background: Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.  Paragraph: Two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, are approximately 100 miles apart and are currently experiencing different weather. Appleton is windy and cloudy, but Orangeburg has very calm air but is also cloudy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city has clouds with less electrons? The answer to this question is:","output":"Orangeburg has clouds with less electrons. Step 1: Analyzing the given information The background information states that friction between clouds and air can cause the clouds to become charged by transferring electrons. In both cases, the cities Appleton and Orangeburg are experiencing cloudy weather. The key difference between the two cities is the presence of wind in Appleton, while Orangeburg has very calm air. Step 2: Comparing the two cities Since Appleton is windy, there will be more friction between the clouds and the air in the city. This friction will result in a transfer of electrons to the clouds, causing them to become negatively charged. In contrast, Orangeburg has calm air, which means there is less friction between the clouds and the air. Consequently, there will be fewer electrons transferred to the clouds in Orangeburg. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the analysis of the situation in both cities, it can be concluded that Orangeburg has clouds with less electrons, as the calmer air conditions result in less friction and consequently, fewer electrons transferred to the clouds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This feat was documented in 1975, in the film \\"The Man Who Skied Down Everest\\". The film won the Academy Award for best documentary, the first sports film to do so.  - Lhotse (Nepali: ) is the fourth highest mountain in the world at , after Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga. Part of the Everest \\"massif\\", Lhotse is connected to the latter peak via the South Col. Lhotse means South Peak in Tibetan. In addition to the main summit at above sea level, the mountain comprises the smaller peaks Lhotse Middle (East) at , and Lhotse Shar at . The summit is on the border between China, Tibet and the Khumbu region of Nepal.  - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 11th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight-thousanders  for every 2 people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to. However, this is primarily because most climbers tend to try to ascend to the primary peak of Lhotse, rather than the lowest summit of the mountain. It was first climbed by Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter on May 12, 1970.  - The Man Who Skied Down Everest is a documentary about Yuichiro Miura , a Japanese alpinist who skied down Mt . Everest in 1970 . The film was produced by Canadian film maker Budge Crawley . Miura skied 6,600 feet ( 2000 m ) in 2 minutes and 20 seconds and fell 1320 feet down the steep Lhotse face from the Yellow Band just below the South Col. He used a large parachute to slow his descent . He came to a full stop just 250 ft. from the edge of the crevasse . The ski descent was the objective of The Japanese Everest Skiing Expedition 1970 . Six members of this expedition died . At the same time , another independent Japanese expedition ( called The Japanese Mount Everest Expedition 1970 ) undertook a combined ascent of ( a ) the normal route ( including Naomi Uemura who made the summit ) and ( b ) the first attempt at the South - West Face ( this is the tall black face on the movie poster with the Y - shaped snowy gully ) . Two members of this second expedition died . Crawley won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for this picture .

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards.' The veto threat came as lawmakers began debate on the measure in the House. A vote is expected on Friday. Republicans say the bill would restore local control in schools and stop top-down education mandates. Democrats say it would allow billions in federal dollars to flow out without ensuring they will improve student learning. The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards' The bill maintains annual federal testing requirements. It consolidates or eliminates many federal programs, creates a single local grant program and allows public money to follow low-income children to different public schools. It would also prohibit the federal education secretary from demanding changes to state standards or imposing conditions on states in exchange for a waiver around federal law. Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia said the bill would allow states to redirect federal funds away from districts with high concentrations of poor students. 'In other words, the low-income areas would get less, the wealthy areas would get more,' Scott said. 'If that's the solution, I wonder what you think the problem was.' The White House said it was opposed to the bill because it 'abdicates the historic federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of America's students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners, and students of color.' Furthermore, the bill 'fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources,' the White House said. The statement was the latest in a series of veto threats issued by President Barack Obama since both chambers of Congress went under Republican control last month. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio called the education measure 'a good conservative bill that empowers America and does not empower the bureaucracy here in Washington.' 'If you step back and look at what the president’s doing, the president’s trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington,' he said in a statement. 'We’re for an opportunity society and empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that’ll help them be successful in life.' At a news conference Wednesday, Boehner called education 'the civil right of the 21st century.' The measure, pushed by Education Committee Chairman John Kline, of Minnesota, would provide states and local communities greater flexibility over how 'federal dollars are used to educate America's kids,' Boehner said. Kline said education can be the 'great equalizer' in America, but only if schools succeed. About 1 in 5 students drops out of high school, and many who do graduate enter college or the workforce with subpar education, Kline said. He decried federal mandates that dictate how to gauge student achievement, define qualified teachers and spend money. 'We need to place less faith in the secretary of education and more faith in parents, teachers and state and local leaders,' he said. Speaker of the House John Boehner accused the president on Wednesday of 'trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington.' Republicans, he said, are for empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that’ll help them be successful in life' The bipartisan No Child Left Behind law President George W. Bush signed in 2002 sought to close significant gaps in the achievement of historically underserved group of students and their more affluent peers. It mandated annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three to eight and again in high school. Schools had to show student growth or face consequences. No Child Left Behind required that all students be able to read and do math at grade level by 2014. The Obama administration in 2012 began allowing waivers around some of the law's more stringent requirements if schools agreed to certain conditions, like using college- and career-ready standards such as Common Core. House Republican leaders view the bill as a way to show their opposition to the Obama administration's encouragement of the Common Core state standards. The standards have been adopted in more than 40 states and spell out what English and math skills students should master at each level. They have become a political issue in many states because they are viewed by critics as a federal effort even though they were developed by U.S. governors. In the Senate, there appears to be more of a bipartisan effort to fix the law. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, have said they were working together on a proposal. Alexander said this week he wants to get a bill to the full Senate in March.

Sentence 1: One day, soon perhaps, the public will have to stop gaping at the ability of Boris Yeltsin 'to be good at times of crisis. - This sentence suggests that at some point in the future, the public will need to stop being amazed by Yeltsin's ability to handle crisis situations effectively. Sentence 2: The public thought Yeltsin failed at times of crisis. - This sentence suggests that the public believed Yeltsin was unsuccessful during crisis situations. Step 1: Identify the main subjects and actions - In both sentences, the main subject is Boris Yeltsin, and the action involves his performance in times of crisis. Step 2: Compare the actions - Sentence 1 highlights Yeltsin's ability to be \\"good\\" during crises, whereas Sentence 2 states that the public thought Yeltsin \\"failed\\" during crisis situations. Conclusion:  - Due to this difference in the actions (being good at handling crises vs. failing during crises), Sentence 2 is NOT entailed by Sentence 1, as they present contrasting perspectives about Yeltsin's performance in times of crisis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ian had to buy the house alone.; (ii). Benjamin had to buy the house alone.;","output":"(ii). Benjamin had to buy the house alone. In this situation, Ian's poor credit history is a roadblock to obtaining a loan or mortgage when looking to buy a house. Credit history is a critical factor in the eyes of lenders when evaluating loan applications. A poor credit history indicates that Ian has had difficulties managing his finances in the past, which renders him a high-risk candidate in the eyes of the lenders or banks. It might lead to loan application rejection or, if approved, high-interest rates. On the other hand, Benjamin does not have a poor credit history. His good standing in financial matters makes him more reliable and less risky in the eyes of lenders when assessing loan applications. Consequently, Benjamin would have a higher chance of securing a loan or mortgage at favorable interest rates. As a result, Benjamin would need to proceed with buying the house alone to ensure the best loan terms and success in the buying process. Having Benjamin purchase the house alone minimizes the risk associated with Ian's poor credit history for both the lender and the applicants. Once Benjamin has secured ownership of the house, both parties can explore options to address Ian's credit history and include him in future financial decisions involving the property if desired. It's essential for Ian to work on rebuilding his credit by making payments on time, reducing debt, and managing his finances better. It may take some time for Ian's credit history to improve, but with diligence and commitment, it is possible. As Ian's credit history improves, they can explore opportunities to refinance the mortgage or add Ian to the title of the property, considering Benjamin's willingness and their shared goals. In summary, due to Ian's poor credit history and the potential issues it can cause while applying for a loan or mortgage, Benjamin has to buy the house alone. This decision helps secure the house with more favorable loan terms, aiming for long-term ownership and financial stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The whole thing is about two kids whose dance crew is challenged by some preppy wanna-be-black suburbanites who steal the crew's moves thanks to a treacherous friend named Sonny. Omarion and Marques's character fall out over Omarion dating Marques's sister and things get more problamatic from then on. The acting is atrocious and the dance moves might be cool at first but get pretty mundane after a while. Omarion as well as Marques Houston cant act. Lil Kim looks like recovering heroine junkie and the attractive Jennifer Freeman(My Wife and Kids) is whiter than Jenny McCarthy. You can tell this was a vanity project for the suspiciously effeminate Chris Stokes. And it still bombed! If you're into a movie all about dancing then go right ahead but if you're looking for something more than a dull dance film with heavily edited dance scenes look elsewhere. You just got served suckaz! Is this product review negative? A:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the movie \\"You Got Served,\\" citing various aspects that they find unsatisfactory. Firstly, the reviewer states that the movie was the worst film of 2004, setting an overall negative tone. They criticize the plot, calling it mundane, and implying that it lacks originality and depth. They elaborate on the story's conflict between dance crews, highlighting the tension caused by a relationship between Omarion's character and Marques Houston's sister. The reviewer goes on to strongly criticize the acting, specifically mentioning that Omarion and Marques Houston cannot act. They also criticize Lil Kim's appearance, comparing her to a recovering heroin junkie, and comment on Jennifer Freeman's skin tone. This adds to the negative assessment of the movie, as it suggests the actors were poorly cast or unable to deliver strong performances. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that the dance scenes get mundane after a while, implying that the primary focus of the movie—dancing—is not engaging enough to keep the audience's interest. They also comment on the film being a vanity project for Chris Stokes, suggesting that the movie was made for his personal benefit, rather than for the purpose of producing a quality film. Lastly, the reviewer's closing remark, \\"You just got served suckaz!\\" serves to emphasize their negative view of the movie, and the title, \\"You got served junk...suckaz!\\" sets a mocking and negative tone. In conclusion, this product review can be considered negative, as the reviewer expresses their disapproval and dissatisfaction with the movie \\"You Got Served,\\" criticizing the plot, characters, acting, and the focus on dancing as both dull and uninteresting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father.

Given the background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.  and the situation: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together.

Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

On a hot summer day, as the boys trek through the woods on one of their many adventures, they veer off their usual path and come across something unexpected: a girl their age named Amina, standing in a small, forgotten clearing. A flustered Amina introduces herself, mentioning that she's an orphan from a nearby village who has been living alone in the forest to escape the town's scrutiny. She explains that she possesses a strange magical ability to communicate with the animals, an ability she has honed while living in the woods.

They waste no time in showing her their secret hideout, and she instantly becomes a cherished member of their group. Amina opens up to the boys, confiding that she can also see hidden paths throughout the woods that are invisible to others.

Zoos and research centers look after about 160 pandas. Scientists are studying how they live and more baby pandas are born in the zoos. Pandas live in the forests and mountains of Southwest China. They mainly live on bamboo, and each panda needs to eat a lot of bamboo every day. The area of bamboo is becoming smaller for many different reasons, so pandas have less and less land to live on. Pandas don't have many babies, and baby pandas often die. The situation is becoming very serious. Our government is working hard to save pandas. There are more than 30 nature reserves to protect pandas but these are not enough. The government has made a new plan to help pandas. The nature reserves will be bigger and the bamboo will grow better. Then the pandas will have enough food to eat and enough places to live in. Pandas born in the zoos may go back to live in the nature reserves. Most people love pandas. The panda is one of the best-known animals in the world. It is the symbol for the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF works to protect all animals in danger, so the panda has become the symbol of all animals in danger.

Mr Lewis, who joined the retail giant from consumer goods firm Unilever just five months ago, has pledged to slash costs and sell assets to fund lower prices and mend Tesco's finances. Retail union Usdaw said the store closures were \\"devastating news\\" for the 2,000 staff involved. \\"Our priority is to maximise employment within Tesco, seek redeployment opportunities for members, where possible, and to keep job losses to a minimum,\\" said Pauline Foulkes from the union. Tesco's announcement marks a stark contrast to Tuesday's update from Waitrose that detailed plans to create 2,000 jobs in new shops and by expanding existing sites. The retailer is opening 14 new shops from spring this year, seven of them smaller convenience outlets. However, of the so-called \\"big four\\" supermarkets, which includes Tesco as well as Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda, most are shelving expansion plans or even closing stores.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The younger your birds, the more quickly they'll adjust to you and your home. Younger birds will only ever be familiar with you and your space, and they shouldn't have to overcome any bad experiences with previous owners. Mature domesticated pigeons should eventually learn to trust you as well, but they may require a little more time and patience. Pigeons are extremely social birds who need constant companionship. If your pigeons choose to court and mate, they'll be together for life. Plan on keeping at least two birds. If you have room, consider creating a small flock of four to six pigeons.  If you end up with a mated pair, you may need to keep the pigeons from breeding. Female pigeons lay eggs every month. Once they've laid two eggs, remove the eggs and replace them with warmed-up wooden eggs. Both pigeons will continue to sit on the wooden eggs until they realize they won't hatch. Destroy the real eggs by leaving them outside for other animals to eat. This process will need to be repeated each month.  If your female bird is sitting on a fake egg, it won't continue to lay eggs. Laying eggs too often can result in calcium deficiency and death. Any female bird can lay eggs, though without a male bird they will be infertile. You can find fake eggs online. For example, try http://theeggshop.com/. There are many domesticated pigeons without homes located at animal or bird shelters and rescues. While adopting may not allow you to choose the exact age or breed of pigeon that you'd like, you'll be helping out a bird in need. Adoption is also a generally less expensive option than purchasing birds through breeders.  Most adoption services will cover any initial vet bills. They sometimes also allow you to foster your birds to see if you make a good match. Adopting may provide you with birds that either require more time before they're tamed, or that never become fully comfortable being touched or handled by you. Be ready to spend lots of time building trust. Find reputable breeders by contacting them directly. Ask how long the breeder has been operating, and see if they'd be willing to send photos of their facility to make sure their birds are well treated. Breeders can allow you to choose younger birds, or racing, homing, and other types of unique pigeons. They'll also be able to provide you with a pair of birds that's used to spending lots of time with people. Birds from breeders may be ready to be handled more quickly than rescued birds. However, they'll likely cost more than rescued birds. If you find a lost or injured wild pigeon, take the bird to a wildlife rescue that won't kill the bird. While wild pigeons may eventually become comfortable as pets, they'll likely never be as tame as domesticated pigeons. It's also not fair to the wild bird to prevent it from enjoying its previous lifestyle.  Before you take the pigeon to the rescue, call the facility to be sure they're prepared to care for and then safely release the pigeon. You can find a map of bird-safe rescues located in the United States here: http://www.pigeonrescue.org/resources/some-pigeon-dove-friendly-rescues-in-the-us/  Most animal rescues will not kill the bird unless it is beyond saving or has a low quality of life. Summary:","output":"This article discusses the benefits and challenges of keeping pigeons as pets, emphasizing the importance of adopting younger pigeons for easier acclimation, managing breeding and egg-laying, adopting from shelters or purchasing from reputable breeders, and handling injured wild pigeons responsibly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON â Even as they were popping corks on Thursday night after a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate to pass an immigration bill, supporters of the overhaul were laying plans for the far more difficult task of moving something similar through the Republican-controlled House. Speaker John A. Boehner, at a briefing on Thursday, said the House would advance its own bill only if Republicans backed it. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio insisted on Thursday that the House would not take up the Senate bill and would pass its own measure only if a majority of Republicans backed it, instead of relying more on Democratic votes. As a sign of the conservative direction of the debate in the House, its Judiciary Committee recently approved a bill to enforce immigration laws away from the nationâs borders that was much tougher than anything from the Senate. The House has yet to produce a bill that includes a core piece of the Senate legislation: a path to citizenship for 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. While supporters are hardly confident, they say House Republicans will soon discover a crucial difference this year from failed immigration efforts of the past. They say their coalition is broader and far more energized and committed than in 2007, when an immigration overhaul by President George W. Bush did not even reach a vote in the Senate. Latinos, who showed their strength when they overwhelmingly supported President Obama last November, are a leading force, but are not the only one, supporters said. Business and technology industry groups, labor unions, agricultural growers, farmworkers, law enforcement associations, churches, educators, youth groups and other immigrant organizations are also in the mix. The diversity gives supporters a variety of pressure points for approaching reluctant House Republicans, said Clarissa MartÃ­nez de Castro, an organizer for NCLR, the national Latino organization also known as the National Council of La Raza. A lawmaker who does not have many Latino voters in a district might have vegetable farmers, or labor unions, or a university, or an evangelical Christian megachurch, she said. Asked why he thought the overhaul had a fighting chance in the House, Ali Noorani, a veteran of many immigration wars, pointed to a big green mobile billboard that had circled Capitol Hill every day this week. Its flashing message was âPraying for immigrants. Praying for Congress.â Groups of evangelical Christians prayed on the Capitol lawn for the Senate to pass its bill. Mr. Nooraniâs group, the National Immigration Forum, has worked with Southern Baptists and other large evangelical denominations to coordinate prayer campaigns and run pro-overhaul spots on Christian radio stations in states where lawmakers might be persuaded to change their views. âIn 2007, we werenât even on the radar,â said the Rev. Samuel RodrÃ­guez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an evangelical group. Mr. RodrÃ­guez said he had been on the road continuously, addressing primarily non-Hispanic Christian conferences to spread the message on the overhaul. Business groups are also pledging to stay in the fray. âWhat will shock a lot of people in the House is the level of interest and intensity of the business community compared to 2007,â said Scott Corley, the executive director of Compete America, which represents tech companies that are pressing for an increase in visas for skilled immigrants. In 2007, Silicon Valley companies stayed in the background, and after a bruising and finally fruitless fight with labor unions, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lost enthusiasm.Â This year, the Senate bill includes a compromise that the chamber and the A.F.L-C.I.O. worked out to bring in low-wage migrant workers in the future, as well as provisions for high-skilled immigrants. On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee approved its own bill to offer more visas for foreign computer engineers and scientists, which was also to the liking of Mr. Corley and leaders of other tech groups. But Mr. Corley said tech companies remained convinced that such measures had to be part of a comprehensive package like the Senate bill, including the path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the band that preachers frequently objected? is inside the article: Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons. As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as Stoller put it, \\"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\\" At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \\"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\\", can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would the universe look without gravity? It would have no planets and no stars. Thats how it looked when it was young. When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons. It also formed our Sun. This force caused more than just our solar system to form. It caused all the other solar systems to form. It caused the formation of all the galaxies of the universe.  Question: \\"Did the universe always have a sun?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. (i). no (ii). yes...I think the answer is","output":"(ii). yes Yes, the answer is correct. The universe did not always have a sun. Our Sun is just one of countless stars in the universe, and it was formed about 4.6 billion years ago. The universe itself is much older, estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old. In the early stages of the universe, it was just a dense, hot mixture of fundamental particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, basic elements such as hydrogen and helium began to form, and these gas clouds would later give birth to galaxies, stars, and planets under the influence of gravity. The process of star formation, including how our Sun was created, involves gravity acting on massive clouds of gas and dust. Small regions within these clouds began to contract due to the gravity, compressing and heating the matter inside. As the pressure and temperature increased, nuclear fusion eventually ignited, and stars were born. Similarly, galaxies, which are vast assemblies of stars, gas, and dust, were formed through gravitational interactions between these early cosmic structures. Without gravity, the universe would look completely different. The gas and dust that initially permeated the early universe would not have clumped together to create stars, planets, and galaxies. There would be no structure or organization; only a dispersed mixture of particles floating aimlessly in the vast expanse of space. Solar systems, including our own, would not have formed, and life as we know it would not exist. In conclusion, gravity has played a fundamental role in shaping and driving the development of the universe. From the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies to the phenomena that we observe around us every day, the force of gravity has been an indispensable element in the story of our cosmos. Without it, the universe would be a vastly different and lifeless place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Emerson, a young former surfing pro and his younger sister Nicole move to Luna Bay, California, following the death of their parents, to live in a house owned by their aunt Jillian. Chris leaves his address at the home of Edgar Frog, the town's surfboard shaper, in hopes of getting a job. Chris is approached at their new home by former pro surfer, Shane Powers (played by Angus Sutherland the half brother of Kiefer Sutherland who played David from the original film), who invites him to a party that night. Chris and Nicole go to the party, where Shane and his friends Kyle, Erik and Jon are entertaining themselves with the human guests. Chris showers with a girl named Lisa and Shane gets Nicole alone, chats with her for a bit, and then tricks her into drinking his blood. When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house. Then, Lisa shows up and pretends to chat with Chris for a bit before she finally tries to seduce and feed on him. In fending her off, he accidentally impales her on a mounted rack of antlers, killing her explosively when she turns into stone and explodes. Finally convinced of the situation, remembering what Edgar said and believing that he was right, Chris seeks out Edgar's help. Edgar explains that Nicole is only half-vampire, and will remain that way unless she feeds, and she can be turned human again if they kill the head vampire before that. Chris interrupts her just before she can feed on Evan Monroe, a nice guy who has been courting her, and explains what is happening to her, and Nicole is surprised at what she almost did (because she believes herself to be a vegetarian). However, Shane draws her to their lair and they have sex.

Write a title for this article: WOODEN wall panels, cream leather sofas and flatscreen televisions… it may look like a penthouse suite, but this swanky pad has wheels. These stunning pictures reveal the luxurious surroundings enjoyed by workers at one of Europe’s largest travelling fairs. The families who run Hull Fair in East Yorkshire have opened the doors to their dazzling homes, some of which are even towed by articulated lorries. Mum-of-three Dayna Gray’s lives in a 30ft caravan that comes with a six-figure luxury price tag. The 42-year-old insisted people shouldn’t be surprised by the impressive surroundings the families live in. Dayna, a seventh-generation showperson, said: “Some people think we’re rolling in it. But we’re always on the move so these are our homes.” “People see lads with tattoos all over them and oil all over their clothes from the rides and they think we’re all like that. “But actually they’re likely to be the casual workers we take on.” The Hull Fair, one of the largest travelling funfairs in Europe, comes to the city once a year and is said to be more than 700 years old. Dayna continued: “We are always on the move. It would make no sense having an unreliable car that isn’t capable of pulling a ride that might be worth tens of thousands of pounds.” That’s not to say they aren’t fans of more traditional vehicles, with a number of flash Mercedes and Mustangs parked outside the massive caravans. One shiny red Mustang sitting outside the caravan is barely six months old and cost £25,00,000. A 2012 silver Mercedes Benz parked nearby has the personalised licence plate 4440 MG, while another Benz parked by the caravans was bought new in 2013 and is worth at least £10,000. The house-proud fair workers have also spoken out against how they claim to be portrayed in the community – insisting they “work hard, play hard”, pay their taxes and ensure their children are well-educated. While Dayna’s husband Victor, 44, looks after the children’s rides, their own kids – Jaeger, 12, Sienna, nine and Alana, four – are at a make-shift school created for the fairground children in the nearby sports stadium. The camaraderie between the families is also important. Dayna’s long-time friend Stacey Greatorex, 44, who was keen to dispel rumours about their lifestyle. She said: “We do get portrayed as travellers and Gypies. We share a lot of the same values as the Gypies – similar views on marriage, that kind of thing. “We also look after our own. We pay public liability insurance and our taxes, which might surprise some people.” The lifestyle of a travelling fair worker had changed dramatically over her lifetime, Stacey said. She added: “I left school at 12. They weren’t interested in teaching you when you were only going to be there for a few weeks. “It’s different now. Now our children are given work packs to take away or they get schooled at temporary schools set up for them.” “My little boy is marvellous at maths because he deals with money all the time. He earns his pocket money on the rides.” Dayna’s brother, David Wallis, is also part of the travelling community and lives in his own impressive caravan with his wife, Penelope, and their children Isabella, 11 and Adina, seven. Of people’s misconceptions, Penelope said: “A lot of people don’t understand us. “People imagine this tiny, little caravan. We have a lovely home with everything you’d expect to see in a house – cooker, washer, dryer, dishwasher. “I am very proud of what we have and what we have achieved as a family.” We pay for your stories!

The sentence \\"CAMRA have surveyed the 50,000 pubs in Britain and they believe that there are very few pubs that still have classic snugs.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"According to CAMRA, how many pubs in Britain possess classic snugs?\\" This is because the sentence does not offer specific quantitative information about the number of pubs with classic snugs. Although the sentence states that CAMRA believes there are \\"very few\\" pubs with classic snugs, this is a subjective and imprecise term that could result in different interpretations. In order to provide a valid answer to the question, an exact figure or a more concrete range would be needed. Including such information in the response would help readers better understand and quantify the prevalence of classic snugs in British pubs. For example, the answer could be considered valid if it were phrased like: \\"According to CAMRA, out of the 50,000 pubs in Britain, only 1,000 (or some specific number) possess classic snugs.\\" This way, readers would receive a clear and precise answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First published in 1923, it’s a magazine that has adorned many coffee tables for decades since - and given us a fascinating insight into broadcasting over the past nine decades. Now an exhibition at the Museum of London will soon showcase 90 years of the Radio Times, with memorable covers including the 1966 World Cup, EastEnders launch in 1985 and George VI’s coronation in 1937. Also included in the set is the magazine’s first issue from September 28 1923, the first Christmas issue from the same year - and the award-winning Doctor Who ‘Vote Dalek’ cover from 2005. 'Organ of the BBC': The Radio Times first edition from 28 September 1923 (left) and the first Christmas edition from 21 December (right) in the same year are pictured. Famous dates: This front-cover through a window was for George VI's coronation on 7 April 1937 (left). The other for 9 August 1940 (right) is 'Bombers over Germany' Other highlights include a 1941 Luftwaffe map, which plots the magazine’s printing plant in Park Royal, north-west London, as a Nazi air-raid target along with transport hubs, factories and landmarks. Radio Times staff had been moved there from central London when the Second World War began - and the plant became a strategically-important target as part of the war on propaganda. The map - showing the plant which also printed fellow BBC magazine The Listener - was found by U.S. air force intelligence officer Captain Andrew Wilson at the Fritzlar airbase in Germany in 1944. The exhibition also features a Doctor Who display - a Radio Times regular since 1964 - and visitors will be able to put themselves into a photograph of the ‘Vote Dalek’ cover against a backdrop of Westminster Bridge. Iconic: The Charlie Chaplin cover from 10 October 1952 (left) is joined in the exhibition by the World Cup cover from 7 July 1966 - the year England won the competition. Sports and comedy: The Wimbledon cover from 29 June 1967 (left) marked the summer which saw the first colour broadcast to air on British TV - the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The Morecambe & Wise cover from 3 January 1976 (right) is also seen. The front-page was voted most iconic cover ever by the Periodical Publishers Association in 2008. 'To flick through the covers of Radio Times over the past 90 years is to watch a popular history of Britain unfold' Ben Preston, Radio Times editor. Radio Times editor Ben Preston said: ‘To flick through the covers of Radio Times over the past 90 years is to watch a popular history of Britain unfold. ‘Royal weddings, coronations, the outbreak of war and peace, moon landings and even a victorious World Cup, household names created and stars born - all have graced the cover of Radio Times. ‘No other magazine can rival Radio Times for showcasing the work of some of the nation’s finest artists and photographers, creating unforgettable magazine covers that resonate today.’ Albert Square: The EastEnders cover from 16 February 1985 (left) preceded the first episode of the soap that month. Call the Midwife is seen (right) from 11 February 2012. Famed: The 'Vote Dalek' cover against a backdrop of Westminster Bridge from 2005 was voted most iconic cover ever by the Periodical Publishers Association in 2008. Historic: London street map printed for use by Luftwaffe pilots. Colour-coded bombing targets - including the Radio Times print works in Park Royal, north-west London, have been printed on the map in red and purple.

I have a new situation: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted.                                                                                            Thomas is a research assistant and has taken samples of rat liver enzymes that need to be stored overnight. He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top.  But I can use this background: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  What is an answer for this question: Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","output":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one in refrigerated storage. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in matter. 2. In everyday usage, temperature indicates how hot or cold an object is. 3. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. 4. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. 5. Many unstable materials, such as enzymes, will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Based on the background information provided, it can be concluded that the enzyme sample stored in refrigerated storage will be viable for a longer period. The lower temperature of the refrigerator slows down the chemical reactions and helps preserve the integrity of the enzymes. In contrast, the sample left out on the countertop will be exposed to higher temperatures, leading to faster degradation of the enzymes and impacting its viability."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The other options listed do not fit the context of wearing a suit as well:  - Urban area: While urban areas may include business districts, they could also encompass various other places like residential areas, shopping centers, and parks.

Since you're working with a fraction, you know that your answer will be less than one, so this first step is necessary.

Though 3 and \\"3.0\\" are the same, adding the extra zero will allow you to divide 4 into the 3.0. .

The answer to this question is:","output":"True"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following movie (choose your answer from the options) review sentence? misogynist  Options:  (1). negative.  (2). positive. The answer is:","output":"(1). negative.  The term \\"misogynist\\" refers to someone who dislikes, despises, or is strongly prejudiced against women. In the context of a movie review, labelling a movie as misogynist would generally mean that the reviewer perceives the movie as promoting or endorsing such negative attitudes towards women. This is likely to mean that the reviewer had a negative sentiment towards the movie.  An important aspect of sentiment analysis is understanding the connotations associated with certain words. \\"Misogynist,\\" despite being just a word, has a negative connotation. It inherently denotes a harmful and regressive viewpoint, making it a strong indicator of negative sentiment. Therefore, when a reviewer uses this term to describe a movie, they are most likely expressing a negative opinion about it.  Moreover, depending on the sociocultural context, a movie described as misogynist might not only displease individual viewers but also groups advocating for gender equality, causing general disapproval. Hence, the sentiment associated can be considered negative.  To conclude, given the connotation and implication of the term \\"misogynist,\\" when it is used in a movie review, it denotes a negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Eric Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia (nee Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). As a child, Eric developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In April 1986, police officers raided his house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing \\"harmful material to minors\\" in the Dead Kennedys album Frankenchrist. However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster Landscape XX (Penis Landscape) included with the album. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost-effective way of sending a message out to other musicians with content considered offensive in their music.  Music author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a \\"small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.\\" Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a 2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances.  Biafra has a cameo role in the 1988 film Tapeheads. He plays an FBI agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by Tim Robbins and John Cusack). While arresting them his character asks \\"Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?\\" lampooning the obscenity prosecution.  On March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program This American Life, \\"Episode 285: Know Your Enemy\\", which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the Frankenchrist trial.  In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that after Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some 75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band.  According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \\"posthumous\\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.  In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \\"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\\" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay 200,000, including 20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works -- which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.  In the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and Adrian Borland (of The Sound) for the electropunk musical project The Witch Trials, releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime.  In 1988, Biafra, with Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of the band Ministry, and Jeff Ward, formed Lard. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which is being recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. While working on the film Terminal City Ricochet in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors. Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy the following year. Biafra also provided lyrics for the song \\"Biotech is Godzilla\\" for Sepultura's 1993 album Chaos A.D..  In 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band the No WTO Combo to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hiphop group Spearhead. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled Live from the Battle in Seattle.  As of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band The Melvins under the name \\"Jello Biafra and the Melvins\\", though fans sometimes refer to them as \\"The Jelvins.\\" Together they have released two albums, and have been working on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra's 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra is also working with a new band known as Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, which includes Ralph Spight of Victims Family on guitar and Billy Gould of Faith No More on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O.  In 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock, Mojo Nixon and Down entitled, \\"Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch & Soul All Stars\\" who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics at Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, Walk on Jindal's Splinters, and a companion single, Fannie May/Just a Little Bit, were released in 2015.","output":"This text is about Eric Boucher, better known by his stage name Jello Biafra.

It is found in northern and central Eurasia , including northern China and the Korean Peninsula . This species is somewhat larger and longer - tailed than most other voles .  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Pitymys is a subgenus of voles in the genus Microtus. Species in this subgenus are:  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.  - Shanghai (\\": Zånhae\\" ), often abbreviated as Hu or Shen, is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. It is the most populous city proper in the world, with a population of more than 24 million . It is a global financial centre and transport hub, with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.  - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.  - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.  - The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army.   - Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are:  - Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: References. D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference. Third Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.  - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world.  - A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory.  - Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, roots, and bark at other times. The genus is also called \\"meadow voles\\". (ITIS database) The species are: Subgenus \\"Microtus\\" Subgenus \\"Terricola\\" Subgenus \\"Mynomes\\" Subgenus \\"Alexandromys\\" Subgenus \\"Stenocranius\\" Subgenus \\"Pitymys\\" Subgenus \\"Pedomys\\" Subgenus \\"Hyrcanicola\\"  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.    What entity does 'reed vole' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? Answer:","output":"The reed vole (Microtus fortis) has the parent taxon relation with the genus Microtus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: US adds 252,000 jobs in December amid improving employment outlook The US economy appeared to be improving as the country added 252,000 jobs in December, with the unemployment rate dropping to 5.6%. The number of unemployed Americans declined by 383,000, which still leaves about 8.7 million people out of work. December’s job report exceeded expectations. Economists expected the Bureau of Labor statistics to report growth of 240,000 in December, making the 2014 gains largest since 1999. Over the year, the job growth averaged 246,000 jobs a month – a significant jump compared to 194,000 in 2013. The “unusual warm-yet-snowy December” meant that weather did not have much impact on the jobs numbers, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. While job growth saw positive gains, pay is not improving. Average hourly earnings took a hit, decreasing by 5 cents in December, following a 6 cent increase in November. Goldman analysts predicted gains of 230,000 jobs and average hourly earning going up by 0.1%. Overall, the average hourly earnings for all workers rose 1.7% in 2014, which according to Goldman is “still below the 3% - 4% rate that Fed chair Janet Yellen identified as normal.” Without the 3% to 4% wage growth, average workers will not benefit from the economic growth, the Economic Policy Institute said. The number of American workers who wanted a full-time job but were only able to find a part-time job remained unchanged at 6.8 million. About 7.3 million Americans held more than one job. That’s means about 374,000 more people who took on a second job since 2013. About 3.9 million of them had one full-time job and one part-time job. The number of Americans participating in the labor force in December declined by 776,000, causing the labor participation rate to drop to 62.5% from 62.8%. Participation rate for black Americans was even lower, at 61.3%. Their unemployment rate was 10.4%, which more than double the white unemployment rate of 4.8%. The job gains of the past few months have not gone unnoticed and as both Democrats and Republicans prepare for 2016, they look to take credit for the improving economy. “2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. We’ve had 57 straight months of private sector job growth, created nearly 11 million new jobs,” Barack Obama said on Thursday while visiting Phoenix, Arizona. “Since 2010, we’ve put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined.” Earlier this week while visiting Ford assembly plant in Detroit, the president especially lauded job creation in manufacturing. Car sales jumped 6% last year to the highest level since 2006, according to Autodata Corp. Analysts forecast that sales will reach 17m this year, near the record of 17.3m set in 2000. That should lead to more jobs at automakers, parts suppliers and dealers. “Demand for autos remains robust. Low interest rates, falling gasoline prices and pent up demand [are] driving sales,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey, said in a presentation on Wednesday. Brusuelas expects the jobs growth to continue into 2015, but pointed out that long-term underemployment and unemployment remain a challenge. In December the number Americans who were unemployed for over 27 weeks “was essentially unchanged at 2.8 million”, reported the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That accounts for 31.9% of the unemployed. Not everyone is sure that the growth will continue. “It is doubtful that hiring will be sustained at this pace for much longer,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. According to Markit’s research, economy is losing momentum as companies grow more concerned about the economic outlook at home and abroad. Those fears are not unfounded. Europe is barely growing, and its unemployment rate is nearly double the US level. Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, is in recession. Russia’s economy is cratering as oil prices plummet. China is straining to manage a slowdown. Brazil and others in Latin America are struggling. Fears about significantly cheaper oil spooked investors earlier this week before financial markets recovered. But most economists remain optimistic that lower energy prices will benefit US consumers and many businesses and give the American economy a further boost. Summary:","output":"The article talks about the significant improvement in the US economy as it added 252,000 jobs in December, causing the unemployment rate to decrease to 5.6%. This exceeded economist's predictions of an increase of only 240,000. However, while job growth increased, average hourly earnings decreased by 5 cents. The Economic Policy Institute claimed that without a wage increase of 3% to 4%, the average worker would not benefit from the economic growth. Despite this, the number of people with multiple jobs rose by about 374,000. The labor participation rate dropped to 62.5% as 776,000 Americans stopped participating in the labor force, with an even lower participation rate among Black Americans at 61.3%. However, both Democrats and Republicans are looking to take credit for the improving economy. Car sales also showed significant increases, and with predictions that sales would increase further, more jobs are expected to be created. However, despite the many positives, there is still concern of long-term underemployment and unemployment, with the number of Americans unemployed for over 27 weeks remaining at 2.8 million. There is also fear that the economy is losing momentum, with worries about the economic outlook at home and abroad. However, economists are hopeful that lower energy prices will help to further boost the economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Multisite surveys hold numerous advantages over single-site studies, especially when it concerns global or regional issues. By conducting research across various sites, researchers are able to: 1. Collect a larger and diverse sample size: By selecting different locations, the study benefits from a broader range of participants, making the findings more generalizable to wider populations. 2. Control for site-specific biases: Some locations may have unique characteristics that influence study outcomes, making it difficult to determine if the results can be applied elsewhere. In multisite surveys, researchers can identify such biases and adjust their analysis accordingly. 3. Improve reliability and validity: If similar findings emerge from different locations, it strengthens the reliability and validity of the study. This multisite approach bolsters the argument that the observed effects are not merely a result of site-specific factors but reflect a more widespread pattern. Given these advantages, it can be inferred that the researchers behind the study, \\"Behavioral risk factors in emergency department: a multisite survey,\\" are keen on conducting an in-depth investigation into the topic. While their multisite approach provides valuable insights, it is difficult to predict if this will be the first of many attempts to research the matter more thoroughly. This hypothesis could be better supported if more information were available, such as: - The researchers' stated goals or objectives: If the researchers explicitly mentioned their long-term intentions to explore the topic further, it would support the hypothesis directly. - Previous research in this field: If this multisite survey fills a gap in existing literature, it might spark further interest and lead to additional research. - Follow-up studies or data collection: If the researchers propose follow-up studies or plan to monitor the participants for an extended period, it would indicate a commitment to expanding their research efforts. - Interest and investment in the field: If notable organizations or institutions show interest and invest resources in this area, it signifies a growing commitment to thoroughly understanding behavioral risk factors in emergency departments. In summary, while the premise demonstrates that the researchers are committed to investigating the issue of behavioral risk factors in emergency departments across multiple locations, it cannot be definitively concluded that this study will be the first of many attempts to explore this matter more thoroughly without additional information. However, given the multisite approach, the study does suggest a dedication to conducting comprehensive research and understanding the topic on a broader scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers:  (1). no  (2). yes The answer is:","output":"(2). yes Both questions are fundamentally asking the same thing, which is to explore the distinct features or characteristics that anacondas have evolved over time to enhance their survivability and success in their environment. Although the phrasing of the questions may be slightly different, they essentially inquire about adaptations that anacondas have developed.  Anacondas are large, non-venomous snakes from the Boidae family and are found mainly in South America within the Amazon and Orinoco basins. They are primarily aquatic and are well-suited for an amphibious lifestyle. Some of the prominent adaptations that these robust snakes possess include: 1. Strong Muscles: Anacondas have powerful muscles that allow them to constrict their prey and suffocate them. They are also able to use these muscles for propulsion through the water and on land, giving them great strength. 2. Camouflage: Their dark coloration with blotchy patterns enables them to blend seamlessly into their surrounding environments, such as murky water and dense vegetation, making it easier for them to ambush unsuspecting prey. 3. Heat Detection: Anacondas are equipped with labial pits, which are sensory organs that can detect heat emitted by warm-blooded animals. This feature helps them hunt in the dark or locate prey hidden in their surroundings. 4. Jaws and Teeth: These snakes have flexible jaws that allow them to open their mouths wide enough to consume large prey, such as deer, capybaras, and caiman. Their row of inward-curving teeth is designed to grip and hold onto struggling prey, preventing it from escaping while the snake constricts it. 5. Nostrils and Eyes: Anacondas have upward-facing eyes and nostrils, which enables them to see and breathe while being mostly submerged in water. This adaptation assists in their stealthy hunting approach in aquatic environments. 6. Lung Capacity: These snakes have relatively large lungs, providing them with ample breathing capacity for extended periods underwater, allowing them to stay submerged while stalking prey or hiding from predators. 7. Slow Metabolism: Anacondas have slower metabolism rates, permitting them to survive without eating for extended periods. This is helpful in environments where prey may be more scarce or when they need to digest a substantial meal. In conclusion, both questions are concerned with identifying the various adaptations that anacondas have developed to increase their likelihood of survival and success within their natural habitats. Despite the varied phrasing, the essence of the inquiry remains consistent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: The first step is to shut off the water for the bathroom you’ll be working in. Locate the main line and turn it all the way off. Then, turn on the faucet in your tub to drain the lines. Use a screwdriver to unscrew the faucet and disconnect it from the water lines by unscrewing it. Remove the handles, overflow drain cover, and the drain cover on the bottom of the tub. If you have a showerhead, remove that as well.  You may need to pry off a plastic cover to gain access to the screws. You may be able to reuse some of these accessories, so keep them if you don’t want to buy new ones. You need to expose the studs in the wall in order to install a new bathtub, so you must remove the existing surround and the drywall behind it. Using a utility knife, cut through the drywall around the outside edge of the entire surround. Then, use a pry bar to pry the drywall and surround or tiles out of place. Be careful not to damage any pipes or wires!  Be sure to wear safety gear, including goggles and a dust mask, throughout this process. Work from the top of the surround down to the bottom. In some homes, you may be able to access the plumbing from the room next to the bathroom. In other cases, the plumbing may be situated in the floor under the tub. Most likely, you'll need to cut a hole in the wall or floor in order to access the plumbing. First, unscrew the tub drain and overflow from the P-trap underneath the tub. If your tub is acrylic or fiberglass, cut it into pieces with a jigsaw to make the removal process easier. If you want to try to keep the tub in one piece, use a jigsaw to cut away the tub flange that’s nailed to the studs, then tip up the tub and pull it out. You may need to slice through the caulk that connects the tub and floor before removing the tub. Use a utility knife to do so.","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to remove an existing bathtub in a bathroom.

Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, which eventually leads to seismic waves shaking the earth, is the accumulation of energy in the earth's crust. This energy builds up due to the movement and interactions of the Earth's tectonic plates.

As they collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, stress and strain are generated along their boundaries, causing the energy to build up.

Now, I do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like Moonwalker comes along, and it's watchable, despite numerous flaws. This film is no more than a highly entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement. Beginning with sickly video set to 'Man in the Mirror' a montage listing his achievements, and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all the highs of his life, then crashes down into a really, really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed Demon', following the adventures of MJ as he runs from manic stop-motion fans, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. The stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. It's passable. Then we see the great video for 'Leave me alone', and straight into the main feature. Yes, the plot is laughable. Very laughable. We see Michael walk out of a building, then get shot at by thousands of troops. Then we hit flashback, showing MJ and three children stumbling upon an underground lair. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' (no specifics are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada. The plot isn't really the important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship thing, and of course, the amazing 'Smooth Criminal' sequence. It's a so-so film, but it is fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of his greatest hits, and some cool little bits, and some quite good special effects (the Robot/Spaceship sequence in particular) Worth it, especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay.

This sentence is an evaluation of a ghost story, stating very directly that it is \\"weak and ineffective.\\" This signals dissatisfaction, disappointment, or disapproval from the speaker. It's a critique that asserts the ghost story does not meet the speaker's standards or expectations for quality and effectiveness.  Breaking this down, the word \\"weak\\" is used here to suggest a lack of strength, which could refer to any number of potential issues. This might refer to a lack of depth or complexity in the plot, poor character development, unoriginal or predictable storylines, or flat, unimaginative wording. In terms of a ghost story, this could suggest that the story does not provoke the desired response of fear, suspense, or intrigue. The word \\"ineffective\\" amplifies this sentiment, suggesting that not only is the ghost story weak, it also fails to achieve its intended goal. In this context, the goal would likely be to scare, startle, or disturb the audience, to make them question the boundary between reality and the supernatural or to leave them pondering the story long after it's over. Again, the use of \\"ineffective\\" implies a failure on several potential fronts: perhaps the plot was not engaging, the writing was not immersive, the horror elements were not well-executed, or the conclusion was not satisfying or impactful. These kinds of loaded terms and clear-cut critiques tell us unequivocally that this statement is expressing a negative sentiment. The sentence does not leave much room for interpretation or ambiguity; its tone is clearly critical and its verdict on the ghost story is decisively unfavorable. Overall, in a more extended and comprehensive discussion or review, the speaker might explore these impressions in greater detail, pointing to specific cases in the story where these weaknesses and ineffectiveness were most evident and suggesting ways in which these issues might be resolved or avoided in future storytelling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether you are looking to test an existing program, or planning tests for a program that isn’t written yet, you’ll need to break it down into discrete parts (“units”). You’ll then write a unit test for each one. The definition of a “unit” varies widely depending on the type of program you are developing. A unit could be a class, but also a single function or procedure. A unit test can be used to check two kinds of scenarios. State-based testing is used to see if a program unit produces proper or expected results. Interaction-based testing, on the other hand, is used to see if a unit sets anticipated methods into action. To write a good test, you’ll need to identify what you are trying to test for, so keep one of these approaches in mind as a model. Keep in mind that you’ll need to write lots and lots of unit tests. You’ll want to run a unit test for every portion of your program. Keeping your tests simple will have several benefits:  Simple tests will help ensure that you really are testing only one unit at a time. The tests’ code will be reliable. If you have complex test code, it will be more prone to problems, making it just that harder to see bugs in the code of the program you are testing. The tests will be faster, decreasing the overall amount of time it takes to do the testing. A simple test will be readable, meaning you may see some potential problems just by looking at the code itself. Seasoned developers know that there are different ways to test a program. Unit tests are narrow, specific, and look at only one portion of a program. Integration tests, on the other hand, look at the whole program in a real environment.

Article: Six Chinese surveillance ships have entered waters near islands claimed by both China and Japan. China said the ships were carrying out \\"law enforcement\\" to demonstrate its jurisdiction over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. At least two of the vessels left after the Japanese coast guard issued a warning, Japanese officials say. The move came after Japan sealed a deal to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. \\"Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,\\" the coastguard said in a statement. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. \\"These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,\\" a statement said.

A: Later treaty was included in the 1924 Soviet Constitution,[clarification needed] adopted on January 31, 1924 by the Second Congress of Soviets of the USSR.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, which was later put into the 1924 Soviet Constitution, was passed and adopted on January 31, 1924, during the Second Congress of Soviets of the USSR. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, commonly known as the Soviet Union or USSR, was a federal socialist state that existed in Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. It was a union of several national republics, but the full naming convention is often abbreviated to the USSR. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party. This treaty was an important document in the formation of the USSR as it legally formalized the union of several Soviet socialist republics. It proclaimed the sovereignty of these republics while recognizing their unity as a part of the USSR. On January 31, 1924, the Second Congress of Soviets of the USSR brought this treaty into effect by passing and adopting it along with the first constitution of the Soviet Union. The Constitution defined the legislative, executive and judicial bodies of the USSR, along with other crucial roles and responsibilities, in order to maintain order, sovereignty and economic stability. Prior to this, the idea of a union was first proposed when a congress of representatives of Soviet republics met in December 1922 and signed a treaty of union which eventually transformed into this Treaty on the Creation of the USSR. The treaty and the subsequent constitution were considered fundamental pieces of legislation that guided the governance of the Soviet Union for seven decades until its dissolution in 1991.  Overall, the adoption of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR marked a critical juncture in the history of the Soviet Union, setting the foundation for its governance structure, its foreign policy, and its commitment to the development of a socialist economy. It also evidenced the resilience and unity of the various Soviet republics, further reinforcing the ideology of socialist internationalism."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Just when it seemed that things couldn't get any better for Thomas, however, his life was suddenly transformed into a waking nightmare. One night, a violent criminal breaks into Thomas' home, attacking his wife and senselessly murdering his innocent young son. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Thomas implores the police for help in catching the criminals while attempting to pick up the pieces of his broken life by visiting a highly respected therapist (Christopher Plummer). When local law enforcement fails to turn up any leads, Thomas' therapist suggests that the vengeful father contact a mysterious group with the resources to ferret out his son's killer and let the father exact the any kind of justice that he sees fit. His marriage failing, Thomas decides to take his therapist up on the offer, sending the lives of everyone involved down a dark path from which there is no escape, and no return.","output":"In the movie \\"Already Dead,\\" the disconsolate man is Thomas Archer (played by Ron Eldard).

Here are possible answers to this question: - motor park - building - neighbor's house - downtown - modern house  I believe the correct choice is \\"neighbor's house\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"neighbor's house\\" because the question specifies that the garage is located \\"across the street from his house.\\" This statement provides important contextual information that helps us eliminate the other options and determine the most accurate location. Let's analyze each of the other choices and explain why \\"neighbor's house\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Motor park - A motor park, also known as a parking lot or car park, is a designated area where motor vehicles can be parked. Although it is possible that the garage could be located within a motor park, the context of the question, \\"across the street from his house,\\" does not suggest a motor park. Residential areas typically do not have motor parks across the street from houses. 2. Building - The term \\"building\\" is quite broad and could encompass a variety of structures, including garages. However, the question specifically refers to a garage, and the fact that it is across the street from the person's house implies that it is more likely part of a residential property. \\"Building\\" is too vague a description and does not offer enough information to determine the exact location of the garage. 3. Downtown - This option seems to be the least relevant of all the choices. \\"Downtown\\" refers to the central or main business district of a city or town, which is usually a geographical area that includes a hodgepodge of commercial and residential buildings. It is unlikely that a garage would be located downtown and directly across the street from a resident's house. 4. Modern house - While it is possible that the garage could be part of a modern house, this description does not provide any specific information about the location of the garage relative to the person's house. The question, on the other hand, clearly states that the garage is \\"across the street from his house.\\" As a result, the \\"modern house\\" descriptor is not directly related to the location of the garage and does not serve as a suitable answer. Taking all of these factors into account, the correct choice is \\"neighbor's house.\\" The fact that the garage is located directly across the street from the person's house suggests that it is part of a residential property, probably belonging to one of the person's neighbors. This answer aligns with the information provided in the question, making it the most accurate and appropriate option."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Also keep in mind that 1 mile = 5280 feet. 2. Guidelines: The formula to calculate speed is \\"Speed = Distance ÷ Time.\\" 3. Use the guidelines:    a. First, find the speed in feet per second (ft/s): Speed = Distance ÷ Time = 300 feet ÷ 5 seconds = 60 ft/s.    b. Now, we need to convert the speed from ft/s to mph:       - To do this, convert the distance from feet to miles: 60 ft × (1 mile / 5280 ft) = 60/5280 miles (cancel out the 'feet' units).       - Next, convert the time from seconds to hours: 1 second × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 1/3600 hours (cancel out the 'seconds' units).       - Now, find the speed in miles per hour: (60/5280 miles) ÷ (1/3600 hours) = (60/5280) × (3600/1) = 40.90909 mph. 4.

Several recurring James Bond characters, including M, Q and Eve Moneypenny return, with the new additions of Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann, Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh and Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What actor portrays Mr. Hinx in Spectre?","output":"The actor who portrays the character of Mr. Hinx in the movie 'Spectre' is Dave Bautista. Dave Bautista, also known as David Michael Bautista Jr., is an American actor, former professional wrestler, and mixed martial artist. He gained much of his fame from his stint in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he was popularly known by his ring name 'Batista'.  In the context of the James Bond franchise and specifically 'Spectre', Bautista plays a formidable antagonist. As Mr. Hinx, he is a brutally efficient assassin working for the criminal organization Spectre, known for his physically imposing frame and silent yet deadly demeanor. This role further affirmed Bautista's versatility as an actor, who is also known for his humorous portrayal of Drax the Destroyer in the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movies under Marvel Cinematic Universe. Despite having a wrestling background, Bautista has successfully transitioned into acting and made a significant impact in Hollywood with diverse roles. His robust physique, combined with his acting skills, made him ideal for the role of the menacing Mr. Hinx in 'Spectre', adding an extra edge of physical threat to James Bond's enemies.  In conclusion, Dave Bautista's portrayal of Mr. Hinx was received positively and added another memorable character to the ever-growing list of James Bond adversaries. His casting choice enhanced the scope of the Bond franchise by incorporating a villain who represents a formidable physical threat and uses violence as his primary language, offering a stark contrast to the suave, sophisticated image of James Bond."},{"instruction":"Drought is major concern in the Midwest.

Anthony Weiner and a 17-year-old girl and are looking for any other young women who may be involved, though the nature of the communications wasn't immediately clear.      The police probe comes as Weiner, who is married, fends off calls from both sides of the aisle in Congress for him to quit after he admitted to lying about his inappropriate online and phone communications with a half dozen women.      Weiner's interactions with the Delaware girl \\"were neither explicit nor indecent,\\" Weiner spokeswoman Risa Heller said Friday night.      Two officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the high school junior's home around 4:30 p.m. Friday when FoxNews.com was inside speaking with a family member. The Delaware cops asked FoxNews.com to step outside so they could speak with the 17-year-old's mother in private. While FoxNews.com was walking down the driveway, the daughter was walking up.      The girl, whose name is being withheld because she is a minor, told FoxNews.com, \\"I'm doing OK.\\"      The police left the home after about 30 minutes, followed by the daughter and mother, who left in a separate car. It was not clear if the mother and daughter were going to continue the conversation with police at another location.      Sources close to the student said the girl followed Weiner on Twitter after seeing him speak during a school trip to Washington on April 1. Weiner, after signing on to follow the girl's Twitter feed, direct-messaged the girl on April 13, the sources said, though it is not clear what other communication the two may have had between or after those dates. Weiner no longer follows the girl on Twitter.      At a news conference Monday, Weiner responded to mounting reports of inappropriate online communications by admitting he had sent lewd photos and sexually suggestive messages to six women through social networking sites over a three-year period.      Those women were all adults, \\"to the best of my knowledge,\\" he said, though he admitted that he couldn't know for sure. \\"All I know is what they publish about themselves in social media,\\" he said.      The confession came after Weiner had lied for a week about how a photo of his bulging underwear was sent to all of his Twitter followers before he quickly deleted it. Weiner claimed his Twitter account was hacked and that he was the victim of a prank. In fact, he had intended to send the photo to a 21-year-old college student but accidentally made it public. ||||| Last week, Mr. Weiner acknowledged that he had sent other explicit photos and messages to at least six women he met over social media.      The family member said: “I am angry. This is surreal and unbelievable. It is absolutely crazy. We are just regular people who go to baseball games and basketball games, as ordinary and plain as can be.”      In the past few days, the girl and her family have become subjects of intense interest in the news media. On Friday, the local police arrived at their home and asked the girl and her mother to bring the girl’s phone and computer to the police station so they could be checked to make sure no crime had occurred. In a statement on Saturday, the police said that detectives had interviewed the teenager and that she had made no disclosure of inappropriate activity or inappropriate contact by the congressman.      The girl’s contact with Mr. Weiner started in early April, after her trip to Washington. The congressman spoke to her school group, and she began following him on Twitter, posting a public message saying how much she liked his speech.      Two days later, Mr. Weiner began following her on Twitter. On her profile, she says she aspires to be president. In a private message he sent to her, he said: “How hip am I talking to a future president.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Delighted that she had heard directly from a congressman, the girl wrote a public post on her Twitter feed: “talking to Rep Weiner from New York right now! is my life real?”      At the time, a group of conservatives was monitoring Mr. Weiner’s Twitter activity, after noticing that he was sending messages to a pornographic star from Tennessee.      When members of the group saw the girl’s post, suggesting she was engaging in a private conversation with Mr. Weiner, they alerted the congressman that they were watching him. “@RepWeiner new pal is a high school girl. First porn actresses now little girls. Weird.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      According to the girl’s family member, people in the group also copied the girl on some of the messages they sent to him, so she sent Mr. Weiner a private message telling him that she felt she was being harassed. He apologized to her in a private message, and removed her from the list of people he followed on Twitter.      About a month later, Mr. Weiner sent out a public message saying he wanted to attract more followers on Twitter and offered to follow people on his account if they wanted him to.      The girl responded to the appeal and posted a public message to him: “Don’t forget me. I used to follow you.” On May 16, he began following the girl again, and over the next 10 days they had three private message exchanges, the family member said.      One was about baseball. In another, he replied to a question she had about legislation by jokingly asking for her advice, the family member said. His third message to her was in response to a link she posted to a YouTube video of his giving a speech, with the message: “My true love.”      In a blog post on Tumblr, she later shared the contents of that private message from him. In it, Mr. Weiner appeared to liken himself to a superhero.      “I came back strong,” he wrote. “Large. Tights and cape ...”      On the Tumblr blog post she added, “My favorite Congressman.” |||||Summary:","output":"Police in New Castle, Delaware are investigating direct online communications between New York Rep. Anthony Weiner and a 17-year-old girl. The nature of the communications is not immediately clear, but Weiner's spokeswoman Risa Heller stated that they were \\"neither explicit nor indecent.\\" This comes as Weiner faces calls to resign after admitting to lying about inappropriate online and phone communications with several women. The girl's contact with Weiner began after she followed him on Twitter, and they had several private message exchanges.

He answered on the third ring. \\"Is this Mr. Ray--uh. . .\\" The sound of shuffling papers. \\"Yes.\\" The voice brightened perceptibly, strapped on a mask of friendliness. \\"My name is John Donovan. I'm an attorney representing the family of Donald Ackerman. I'm sorry to be calling so late.\\" \\"It's not late for me.\\" A laugh, intended to sound nervous or flustered.

Do you mind if I tape record this conversation?\\" Smooth segue, meant to catch him off guard, startle him into acceptance. \\"Yes, I do mind. Can I help you?\\" You fucking bastard. John Donovan paused on his end of the line. Ray imagined him reaching for a legal pad upon which to take notes (just as he was supposed to imagine), though, of course, the tape recorder was still running. \\"Um, I was wondering if I could get some information?\\" \\"Sir, federal law prohibits me from acknowledging either to confirm or deny the presence of the individual of whom you have spoken or his participation in our program.\\" Ray grinned. \\"Very well done,\\" the lawyer said. \\"I guess that sets the parameters.\\" \\"I guess it does.\\" \\"Were you working two nights ago.\\" \\"Sir, I am bound by Center policy and state law from discussing with you the work schedule of our employees at this facility unless you are an officer of the law or bearing a subpoena, in which case, I am only authorized to refer you to my supervisor.\\" Ray grinned again.

There are several elements within the conversation that hint at this possibility. Firstly, the fact that an attorney, John Donovan, is representing Donald Ackerman's family implies that there may be some legal matters concerning Donald that need to be addressed. The attorney could be reaching out to Ray because he might have information about Donald's whereabouts or involvement in the program where they both work. Secondly, Ray's insistence on not providing any information about Donald and mentioning that he is bound by federal law and Center policy indicates that Donald is likely involved in something confidential or sensitive. This could mean that Donald is missing, and the attorney is trying to gather information on his location. Alternatively, it could mean that there is a legal dispute surrounding Donald, and the attorney is attempting to gather evidence in the matter. However, the information provided does not lead to a concrete conclusion about whether Donald Ackerman is dead or still alive. Based on the information available, we know that he is either missing or involved in a legal situation, but there is not enough information to definitively determine his current status."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The French (French: Francais) are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural. Historically the French people's heritage is diverse, including populations of Gauls, Ligures, Latins, Franks, Iberians, Alamans and Norsemen. France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences, and while most French people still speak the French language as their mother tongue, languages like Norman, Occitan, Catalan, Auvergnat, Corsican, Basque, French Flemish, Lorraine Franconian, Alsatian and Breton remain spoken in their respective regions. In the roughly 900 years after the Norman invasions France had a fairly settled population. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the Americas, with the exception of the Huguenots, due to a lower birthrate than in the rest of Europe. However, significant emigration of mainly Roman Catholic French populations led to the settlement of the Province of Acadia, Canada (New France) and Louisiana, all (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the West Indies, Mascarene islands and Africa.  On 30 December 1687 a community of French Huguenots settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but have since been quickly absorbed into the Afrikaner population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of New France. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000. From 1713 to 1787, 30,000 colonists immigrated from France to the Saint-Domingue. In 1805, when the French were forced out of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), 35,000 French settlers were given lands in Cuba.  By the beginning of the 17th century, some 20% of the total male population of Catalonia was made up of French immigrants. In the 18th century and early 19th century, a small migration of French emigrated by official invitation of the Habsburgs to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now the nations of Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and Romania. Some of them, coming from French-speaking communes in Lorraine or being French Swiss Walsers from the Valais canton in Switzerland, maintained for some generations the French language and a specific ethnic identity, later labelled as Banat (French: Francais du Banat). By 1788 there were 8 villages populated by French colonists. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did people feel about that?","output":"Since the text doesn't provide any direct quotes about how people felt, I can still give an idea. People might have had different feelings about the French settling in various places. Some might have been excited about starting a new life, while others may have been nervous about adapting to new cultures and environments. Overall, the French likely saw these migrations as opportunities for growth and exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release, and MAN, did it look scary, Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon. I was incredibly interested, and thought that this could finally be a decent horror/thriller film after years if crap. Well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is: maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements. The advertisements for the movie did both, which lead to my ultimate disappointment. By no means is this \\"the most disturbing movie in years\\". Hell, I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week's release. This movie takes the whole \\"based off of fact\\" thing too far. This movie wasn't complete crap. I must admit, it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means. Other than that, though, this film is one big cliché. After John's wife dies, he learns about EVP, which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances. He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife! My God! It's not just his wife reaching him, it's other dead people. Gee, imagine that. A movie about helping dead people. Come on, give me a break! The clichés don't stop there. There's also the obligatory clock-stopping-at-the-same-exact-time-every-night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero. Not only was the movie cliché, it WASN'T SCARY. The film literally had two jump scenes, and those two scenes are almost identical. The ending is horrible, as it leaves the door WIDE OPEN for a sequel. There's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening, with a nice happy tune playing. Way to break the mood, you guys. Jeez! In the end, if you want another forgettable horror film, see White Noise. The only reasons I could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a Keaton fan or that they are interested in EVP. Sure, the EVP aspects may be slightly interesting, but I don't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face. This film tries to be scary, original, and disturbing, but it's just the opposite. You know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film. \\"I WILL SEE THIS FILM NO MORE.\\" Now, what is this review like? Options are: [I] negative [II] positive","output":"After reading the review, I can conclude that this review is: [I] negative Reasons for this conclusion: 1. The reviewer seems ultimately disappointed with the film. 2. They mention that the movie was filled with clichés and was not scary enough. 3.

Paris, France (CNN) -- Former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her six-year captivity in a book due to hit the shelves Tuesday.  Betancourt, a former presidential candidate in Colombia, was held for more than six years by Marxist rebels before the Colombian military rescued her and 14 others in 2008.  \\"Meme le Silence a une Fin,\\" or \\"Even Silence Has an End,\\" will go on sale around the world, the publishing house Gallimard said.

Betancourt and her family members say the government did not do enough to protect her.  Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members.  In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp.

The reviewer seems to be unhappy with a previous purchase due to it being a \\"remastered\\" version. They mention disappointment with the bass, solos, and backing tracks in the remastered album. Step 2: Focus on the review title. Though the title says \\"5 stars, IF...,\\" it sets a conditional precedent that the 5 stars only apply if the product meets the reviewer's specific expectation, which is that the album is based on the original recordings, not the remastered ones. Step 3: Consider the reviewer's experience with the previous purchase. The user mentions that they already \\"wasted money\\" on a \\"remastered series,\\" and their dissatisfaction with the previous purchase could potentially reflect poorly on the product in question, making it seem less appealing. Step 4: Evaluate the reviewer's request for information. While the reviewer asks other users for insight on the original vs. remastered issue, this uncertainty adds to the potential buyer's hesitance in purchasing the product without further information.

Question: What is Jeff Costello's profession? Movie title: Le SamouraÃ¯ Movie plot: Hitman Jef Costello (Delon) lives in a single-room Parisian apartment whose spartan furnishings include a little bird in a cage. A long opening shot shows him lying on his bed, smoking, when the following text appears on-screen: There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps... ââBushido (Book of the Samurai) Costello's methodical modus operandi includes airtight alibis involving his lover, Jane (Nathalie Delon). Having carried out a murder contract on a nightclub owner, he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses, including piano player ValÃ©rie (Cathy Rosier). Their statements are inconsistent but the investigating officer (FranÃ§ois PÃ©rier) believes Costello is his man based on the witnesses who viewed Costello and his alibi that he was with Jane the whole time. Costello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass to get paid by his employers. However, instead of getting money, he is shot and wounded by a man sent by his employers. Having bandaged his wound and rested, he returns to the nightclub and goes for a car drive with the piano player. He is grateful to her, but does not understand why she protected him from the police even though she was the key witness to the murder. In the meantime, police officers bug his room, which agitates the bird in its cage. Upon returning, Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely. Suspecting an intrusion, he searches his room, finds the bug and deactivates it. In the meantime, the police ransack Jane's apartment and offer her a deal: withdraw your alibi for Jef and we will leave you alone. Jane rejects the offer and shows them the door. Back in his apartment Costello finds himself held at gunpoint by the overpass shooter who gives him money and offers him a new contract (the intended target is not revealed to the audience at this point). Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss, a man by...","output":"Jeff Costello's profession is a hitman.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Information:  - An agonist is a chemical that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response. Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist.  - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body.  - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation.  - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair.  - Pharmacology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals.  - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\".  - Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle.  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear...  - Anakinra ( brand name Kineret ) is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis . It is an interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) receptor antagonist .  - A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered organ located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \\"hand\\" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \\"hands\\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \\"hands\\" though opposable thumbs are lacking.  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms. The cause is not entirely clear. It is believed to involve hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. There is no cure for SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful. Rates of disease vary between countries from 20 to 70 per 100,000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of...  - Efficacy is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as, and for practical purposes is synonymous with, \\"effectiveness\\". It is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer to both the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings.  - Lupus erythematosus is a name given to a collection of autoimmune diseases in which the human immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissues. Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus.  - Alpha-blockers or -blockers are pharmacological agents that act as neutral antagonists or inverse agonists of -adrenergic receptors (-adrenoceptors).  - A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active orthosteric (= right place) site or to allosteric (= other place) sites on receptors, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonistreceptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonistreceptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.  - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of otherwise unrelated drugs defined by their use in rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The term is often used in contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (which refers to agents that treat the inflammation but not the underlying cause) and steroids (which blunt the immune response but are insufficient to slow down the progression of the disease).  - Calcium channel blockers (CCB), calcium channel antagonists or calcium antagonists are several medications that disrupt the movement of calcium through calcium channels. Calcium channel blockers are used as antihypertensive drugs, i.e., as medications to decrease blood pressure in patients with hypertension. CCBs are particularly effective against large vessel stiffness, one of the common causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in elderly patients. Calcium channel blockers are also frequently used to alter heart rate, to prevent cerebral vasospasm, and to reduce chest pain caused by angina pectoris. N-type, L-type, and T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are present in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, and CCBs can directly influence the biosynthesis of aldosterone in adrenocortical cells, with consequent impact on the clinical treatment of hypertension with these agents.  - A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions.   - In the field of pharmacology, an inverse agonist is an agent that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that agonist. A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either.  - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.  - In biochemistry, a binding site is a region on a protein or piece of DNA or RNA to which ligands (specific molecules and/or ions) may form a chemical bond. An equilibrium exists between unbound ligands and bound ligands.  - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.  - In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus; and (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as \\"wrist joints\\". This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum.  - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients.  - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.  - Psoriatic arthritis (also arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that will develop in between 6 and 42% of people who have the chronic skin condition psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Approximately 60% of those affected have the tissue type HLA-B27.  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed...  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (17721840) was a French surgeon best known for his description of rheumatoid arthritis. Born in Orléans, he studied under Pierre-Joseph Desault and Marie François Xavier Bichat in Paris, and then from 1792 under Jean Louis Petit in Lyon. In 1796 he obtained an internship at the famed Salpêtrière Hospital, where he assisted Philippe Pinel. He was appointed professor of clinical medicine at the Salpêtrière in 1799. After the restoration, he also held the professorship at the Paris polytechnic school. He was removed in 1830 at the insistence of King Louis-Philippe of France.

A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and  then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why that  makes sense? Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most  efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive  from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic  regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the  business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relied  upon to \\"regulate\\" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as  distribution utilities. Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to  set pricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters  a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for  lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign  contributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policies  simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. The  generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively  low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.). These components of the  power and gas business can be \\"regulated\\" by the market with respect to rates  and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any more than  grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other \\"retailers\\"  (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition  and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of  service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for  such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign  contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed, the legislation, and the  legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading  in the alternative. But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be  perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents  have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim  of \\"ignorance or mistake\\" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise  of \\"prosecutorial discretion\\".

Question: -  A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step in the coal production process, after the coal has been loaded onto a truck, would be to transport the coal to its final destination. This could involve a few sub-steps, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the coal's end users.  1. Transportation to processing plants or storage facilities: The coal-laden trucks could first carry the extracted coal to specialized processing plants or storage facilities. At processing plants, the coal might undergo cleaning treatments to remove impurities, such as rocks, dust, and other extraneous materials. Cleaning the coal enhances its overall efficiency and value when combusted, while also reducing the amount of harmful emissions produced. Alternatively, the coal might be transported to temporary storage facilities where it can be adequately stored and maintained until further use or transport. 2. Quality control and testing: Before coal is distributed to end-users, it may undergo quality control and testing to ensure it meets relevant industry standards and regulations. This process might involve taking samples of the coal, identifying its quality and composition, and determining its various properties, such as calorific value, ash content, sulfur content, and moisture content. This information is important to optimize the utilization and management of coal resources.  3. Distribution to end-users: Once the coal has been processed, tested, and deemed suitable for use, it will be distributed to various end-users. This may include industrial consumers like power plants, steel mills, cement plants, and chemical manufacturers, as well as commercial and residential consumers for heating and cooking purposes. The coal can be transported by a variety of means, including by trucks, trains, barges, or ships, depending on the location and accessibility of the end-users. 4. Handling and storage at the destination site: Upon arrival at its final destination, the coal will be unloaded from the truck and transferred to appropriate handling and storage systems. This may include coal bunkers, silos, stockpiles, or conveyor belts. Proper handling and storage of coal are crucial to maintain its quality, prevent issues related to spontaneous combustion, and minimize environmental impact resulting from dust or contamination. 5. Environmental compliance and monitoring: Throughout the entire coal production and consumption process, it is vital to ensure compliance with local and international environmental regulations and standards to minimize the negative impacts on the environment and human health. This might involve installing and maintaining pollution control equipment, monitoring emissions, conducting regular inspections, and implementing best practices in coal mining, transport, and utilization. In summary, the last step in the coal production process would involve transporting the coal to its final destination, meeting quality control and testing requirements, distributing the coal to the end-users, ensuring proper handling and storage at the destination site, and complying with environmental guidelines and monitoring. The primary objective of these steps is to optimize the use of coal resources and minimize its detrimental environmental and health effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

USA Football developed Heads Up Football to improve the safety of the sport. We deliver education, resources and best practices to youth organizations and high schools and their coaches, players and parents.      In our continuing effort to improve player safety, USA Football commissioned the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention to conduct an independent study to review the effectiveness of Heads Up Football. The New York Times story published July 27 has raised issues with how the research conducted by Datalys was reported. We have acknowledged our error in using preliminary data after the study was peer reviewed and published. In early July, we informed our partners and constituents of this issue and have since set a policy that when USA Football commissions research, we will share it only once it has been peer reviewed and published.      USA Football stands behind the efficacy of Heads Up Football. We are proud that nearly 70 percent of youth football organizations and a growing number of high schools have joined us in working toward a better, safer game.      ***      Allow me to reinforce the facts that demonstrate the impact and value of Heads Up Football.      FACT: We believe in this program      Heads Up Football is an important football safety program, and it is having a positive effect on youth organizations and high school programs nationwide.      FACT: USA Football is changing behavior for the better      Through the program, coaches learn not only how to teach proper fundamentals and techniques but how to communicate with players and parents in order to foster a positive football experience.      Before Heads Up Football, there was no national focus on teaching and training football coaches, parents and players on concussion recognition and response, heat preparedness and hydration, equipment fitting, sudden cardiac arrest, Heads Up Tackling and Heads Up Blocking. This has led to hundreds of thousands of coaches being trained in the highest standards in the sport, resulting in a safer and more positive environment for the players.      FACT: Heads Up Football is more than tackling      This program delivers the sport’s highest standards on all-player football fundamentals and mechanics alongside important health and safety components.      Through a train-the-trainer model, Heads Up Football is changing behavior by unifying the football community under consistent terminology and techniques.      Launched nationwide in 2013, Heads Up Football originally included the core elements of:      In working with youth and high school football organizations, alongside input from our Medical Advisory Committee and Football Advisory Committee, the program has since added Heads Up Blockingand sudden cardiac arrest protocols as part of the only nationally accredited youth coaching certification program available in the sport .      FACT: Heads Up Football is more than a course      Heads Up Football is a multi-pronged approach that works hand-in-hand with other USA Football resources to create a positive learning environment in which millions of young athletes can learn the sport more safely. These resources are available to all youth leagues, and USA Football strongly recommends their implementation by all coaches to further advance safety.      National Practice Guidelines for Youth Tackle Football. Released in February 2015, these guidelines include a limit of 30 minutes per day for drills operated at full-contact speed defined by USA Football’s Levels of Contact.      Levels of Contact. USA Football is the first national organization in the sport to formally define full contact within practice sessions, breaking drills down into non- or light-contact levels (Air, Bags, Control) and full contact (Thud, Live).      Practice Planner. Youth football coaches can organize their drills quickly and easily while assigning a level of contact and time for each drill.      FACT: Heads Up Football is being embraced      More than 6,300 youth organizations and 1,100 high schools signed up for Heads Up Football in 2015, improving the quality of the sport for their athletes.      Since Heads Up Football’s inception, USA Football has trained thousands of Player Safety Coaches, selected by their leagues to serve as the conduit for the program, along with certifying hundreds of thousands of coaches. Player Safety Coaches are responsible for:      Completing USA Football’s Level 1 online coaching education course      Attending a one-day clinic led by a USA Football-trained Master Trainer      Overseeing his or her organization’s implementation of Heads Up Football      Ensuring that all coaches are certified      Holding in-person clinics for head coaches      Attending practices and games to serve as a reference point for coaches and parents while ensuring that Heads Up Football elements are being taught      FACT: Heads Up Football continues to evolve      USA Football works alongside experts in medicine and sport to constantly evaluate and improve what it offers through Heads Up Football.      As we have added elements and other materials to help coaches do their job better, we will continue to seek and recognize information that adds to the value and benefit of the sport and the children who enjoy playing it.      FACT: Research is showing Heads Up Football works      Heads Up Football reduces injury rates during practices by 63 percent, as shown by a peer-reviewed and published study in The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine (OJSM) in July 2015 (linked).      There also is additional independent research that underscores Heads Up Football’s efficacy in reducing concussions at the high school level:      Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools, the 10th-largest school district in the country, has employed Heads Up Football since 2013. In this time, the district has reported a 43.3 percent decline in concussions among its 3,000 football-playing student-athletes within its 25 high school programs, all of which are enrolled in Heads Up Football. Overall football injuries have declined 23.9 percent.      High schools within the South Bend (Ind.) Community School Corporation (SBCSC), with approximately 1,000 football-playing student-athletes reported concussions from football to decline by 40 percent from 2014 to 2015, the first year the school system implemented Heads Up Football district-wide.      FACT: People believe in Heads Up Football      A number of constituents have provided statements of support of Heads Up Football and its effectiveness.      Bill Curran, the director of student activities and athletics for Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools, has made the following statement:      “In our three seasons within USA Football’s Heads Up Football program, our independent data clearly show that our student-athletes are benefitting from it. We are seeing significant returns. Since adopting the program in 2013, total injuries spanning practices and games among our football-playing student-athletes have decreased 23.9 percent and concussions have decreased 43.3 percent. I have 25 high school football coaches who will tell you Heads Up Football works.”      ***      Dr. Michael Koester, chairperson of the Oregon Schools Activities Association’s Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, states:      \\"Heads Up Football is the logical next step forward as sports medicine experts continue to work with coaches to implement innovative ways to minimize the risk of football injuries. The Oregon School Activities Association's endorsement of the program – and requiring our football-playing schools to adopt Heads Up Football – is an important opportunity for high school coaches statewide to set an example for youth leagues in their communities. As a team physician and the parent of a high school football player, I stand behind Heads Up Football as a leading intervention for safer play.\\"      ***      Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc., is also standing behind Heads Up Football stating:      “As we continue to make football safer and better for young people, Pop Warner places value on changes that make a difference. That’s why we have done things like reduce contact to twenty-five percent of practice time, eliminate kickoffs for our youngest divisions and require that any player who suffers a suspected head injury receive medical clearance from a concussion specialist before returning to play. Giving our coaches the tools they need to teach the game the right way enhances those efforts. It’s why we made USA Football’s Heads Up Football training mandatory for all Pop Warner coaches. Because we’re confident that a well-educated coach is critical to a safer football experience.” ||||| Coach Certification      Heads Up Football ensures that every coach is thoroughly trained in fundamental aspects of football safety, injury prevention and injury recognition.      That’s why one of the key features of the program is Coach Certification — using the only nationally accredited courses in the sport with content created by football experts and health professionals. It is available for middle school and high school coaches through NFHSLearn.com and for youth coaches at usafootball.com/certification. As an added benefit, coaches with valid USA Football certification are eligible for coaching insurance up to 1 million. ||||| Tuesday's Heads Up Football news:      * The Heads Up Football program received validation Tuesday when an NCAA-related study said lifting the head can make a big difference in helping players avoid a concussion, according to CBS News.      \\"Something as simple as lifting their heads up when they're tackling can prevent fatal and catastrophic injuries,\\" said study lead author Zachary Kerr, director of the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program at Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention in Indianapolis.      ... In the new study, published online Aug. 11 in Pediatrics, researchers reviewed more than 2,500 reports of high school football-related concussions in the United States for the school years 2008-09 and 2012-13. All of the concussions resulted from player-to-player collisions -- almost 60 percent during games, the rest at practices.      Of the concussions, 45 percent occurred from injuries to the front of the head. Impacts to the side of the head (22 percent), back of the head (6 percent), and top of the head (6 percent) accounted for the rest where a cause was reported.      The researchers found that the location of the impact didn't affect the symptoms or prognosis for the players. Overall, they were likely to suffer headaches (93 percent), dizziness and unsteadiness (76 percent), difficulty concentrating (61 percent), and confusion and disorientation (52 percent).      However, athletes hit at the top of the head were more likely to be knocked unconscious (8 percent) compared to those smacked somewhere else on the head (3.5 percent lost consciousness). ||||| The NFL has been working hard for the past several years to assuage parents who worry that football is too dangerous for their children. Since early 2015, it has thrown much of its weight and money behind Heads Up Football, a program run by USA Football that teaches youth football coaches safety precautions and drills to ensure proper tackling form. The NFL and USA Football claimed that an independent study showed that the program reduced injuries by 76 percent and concussions by 30 percent.      That sounds great! Except, according to a New York Times report, those claims are not substantiated. The Times reviewed the study by Datalys, a sports injury research firm, and found that youth leagues that used Heads Up Football by itself did not see a reduction in in-game injuries, and that the number of concussions actually went up, albeit by a statistically insignificant margin.      The numbers claimed by the NFL and USA Football were reportedly the results of a preliminary study by Datalys passed along to both organizations in February 2015. When Datalys released its full study the following July, it did not inform either organization that the full data was significantly different from the preliminary findings.      Both the NFL and USA Football acknowledged the errors and told the Times that they would be updating their materials about the program. Scott Hallenbeck, USA Football’s executive director, said that his organization “erred in not conducting a more thorough review.”      The Times report is a significant blow to the NFL, which has been trying to keep youth football programs afloat and ensure that football can remain lucrative in the future. According to the Times, the NFL gave USA Football 45 million in March 2014, largely to encourage more youth leagues to adopt programs like Heads Up Football.      The funding has yet to stem the decline of young athletes playing football. Via the Times:      The N.F.L. and its players’ union formed U.S.A. Football in 2002 to oversee the sport and help it grow among children aged 6 to 14. But participation has dropped precipitously in recent years, from 3 million in 2010 to about 2.2 million last fall — a decline generally attributed to concerns about injuries, particularly to the brain.      One positive takeaway from the report is that Pop Warner Football leagues have had success at reducing injuries by eliminating dangerous head-on tackling drills and reducing full-contact practice time. Those adjustments made by Pop Warner leagues appear to account for Datalys’ preliminary findings of drastically reduced injuries, not Heads Up Football. Again, from the Times:      Similarly, Heads Up Football leagues saw no change in injuries sustained during games unless they also used Pop Warner’s practice restrictions. The drop in practice injuries among Heads Up Football-only leagues was 63 percent, a very meaningful figure. But combined with the in-game injuries the total reduction became about 45 percent, far less than the 76 percent presented by U.S.A. Football and the N.F.L. for the past year and a half.      Bad science is a pattern for the NFL      The NFL and USA Football can plead they were misled, given that Datalys seemingly never informed them that the data they were using was incorrect. This isn’t the first time that the NFL has relied on faulty data to corroborate its best interests, however. In March, the Times found that the NFL omitted at least 100 concussions from a database it used for years to downplay the dangers of head injuries. In May, ESPN’s Outside the Lines released details from a congressional investigation that found that the NFL pulled funding from a concussion study because it didn’t like the lead researcher, forcing taxpayers to cover the cost, and then tried to steer funding to a more sympathetic researcher.      The fact that the NFL didn’t know what Datalys’ study said may have been an honest oversight, but there’s no denying that for more than a year that oversight worked in its favor. Time and again, the NFL has had no problem admitting it was dumb about claims that were conveniently helpful to its cause. Apparently when the league tries to be proactive about its problems, it can’t help tripping over itself.      When the NFL is forced to be reactive, it has taken half measures, from post-career programs that under-service retired players to poor oversight over NFL medical staffs leading to class action lawsuits by former players alleging rampant and dangerous administration of painkillers. Somehow overlooking a published study wouldn’t be the worst thing the NFL has ever done, but it sure doesn’t help a league that is nominally looking out for the health of the people who play its game. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain.

It was good news for everybody, especially the NFL, which has a financial interest in reversing the precipitous drop in youth football participation since the dangers of brain trauma have become better known. It was also not true at all.      What the press releases did not state, and what the NFL and USA Football are indicating, somewhat unbelievably, that they did not realize, were that those findings were preliminary results, released five months before the full study that would completely contradict those figures. Not until now, more than a year since the publication of that full study, and only after being confronted by the New York Times, will they sheepishly retract those claims.      “U.S.A. Football erred in not conducting a more thorough review with Datalys to ensure that our data was up to date,” Scott Hallenbeck, the executive director of U.S.A. Football, said in an email to The Times. “We regret that error.” He added that the material would be removed from the organization’s print and online materials, and that “our partners and constituents” would be notified of the errors. Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman, said that the league would also include updated information from now on.      Heads Up Football is a series of accreditation programs for coaches to teach better and safer practice drills and tackling techniques, much of which instruction took place online. (Our own Drew Magary is certified!)      In 2014, USA Football (which receives nearly all its funding from the NFL) commissioned a study by the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention. In February 2015, preliminary results from Datalys’s research were released, showing that youth football programs who used Heads Up Football showed 34 percent fewer in-game concussions and 29 percent fewer practice concussions than programs that didn’t use it.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The full study, published last July, didn’t show that at all. Instead it found that the actual safety gains were made by Pop Warner Football, which has banned certain blocking and tackling drills and has reduced full-contact practice time, changes not endorsed or enacted by USA Football. (As always, football is safer the less you play it.) After taking Pop Warner leagues out of the equation, the study finds that youth football leagues utilizing Heads Up Football actually saw more concussions than those that did not—though the change was statistically insignificant.      Datalys took the blame for publicizing the positive preliminary results, but not informing USA Football of the full findings until one day after being interviewed by the Times.      Mr. Dompier, the president of Datalys, said in an interview: “We’re the ones that put out the numbers. We’re the ones that kind of blew it.” In an email, Mr. Kerr said that the company had released the early data because, “The results were so compelling, we felt morally obligated to make the youth football community aware of the results.”      This is the sort of thing that happens across all research fields when studies are funded by clients who are clearly seeking a certain result. And it stretches disbelief that the NFL and USA Football did not see the full study when it was published. Either they didn’t want to know anything beyond the positive preliminary press release, or they knew and didn’t want to publicize.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The frustrating thing here is that we’re all on the same side. All of us—NFL executives, youth football administrators, players, parents, fans—want football to be safer. (Our motivations may differ, but not the desired outcome.) But in the meantime, all we ask for is information, not propaganda, to let players and their families make educated decisions. This latest embarrassment is in keeping with decades of evidence that show you should never trust the people who run football to tell you the truth about it.      [New York Times] ||||| Allison Joyce/Getty Images      The NFL and USA Football, the governing body for youth football in America, are desperate to convince the world that the sport is safe and wholesome and not a pathway to debilitating brain injuries. To that end, the league and the nonprofit have touted an educational program called Heads Up Football that promises “to advance player safety.” As Alan Schwarz explains in the New York Times, Heads Up Football has been touted “to thousands of leagues and parents as having been proved effective,” with the NFL and USA Football claiming “that an independent study showed that the program reduced injuries by 76 percent and concussions by about 30 percent.”      It turns out the study, which was published in July 2015, didn’t show anything of the sort. “Heads Up Football showed no demonstrable effect on concussions,” Schwarz writes, “and significantly less effect on injuries over all, than USA Football and the league have claimed in settings ranging from online materials to Congressional testimony.”      Advertisement            The NFL and USA Football—which is closely tied to the NFL, financially and ideologically—told the Times they didn’t know they’d been using faulty data to convince parents to let their children bash their tiny, helmeted heads into other kids. Both organizations blamed the contracted research company, the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention, for providing them with preliminary data that indicated the Heads Up Football program did reduce instances of injury and concussions. Datalys, which received a 70,000 grant from USA Football to conduct the study, took all the blame when questioned by the Times.      The lead researchers for Datalys, Thomas Dompier and Zachary Kerr, confirmed in interviews that, despite knowing that the final paper contradicted their preliminary claims, they did not inform USA Football of this until last month, one day after speaking with the Times.      Mr. Dompier, the president of Datalys, said in an interview: “We’re the ones that put out the numbers. We’re the ones that kind of blew it.”      In an email, Mr. Kerr said that the company had released the early data because, “The results were so compelling, we felt morally obligated to make the youth football community aware of the results.”      Advertisement            Blaming this all on a couple of bumbling researchers isn’t going to fly. After receiving the preliminary findings in February 2015, USA Football announced the results on its website, making no mention that they were not final. USA Football’s blog post, which as of this moment remains online in its original, uncorrected state, claimed a study of more than 6,000 players had found that “compared to non-Heads Up Football leagues, leagues that adopted Heads Up Football had a 76 percent reduction in injuries” and “29 percent reduction of concussions in games.”      In reality, the final study concluded there was no change in injury levels in Heads Up leagues, though leagues that had adopted Pop Warner’s 2012 safety rules changes, which include limiting head-to-head tackling and blocking, did see a reduction in concussions. As Slate’s Science columnist Daniel Engber pointed out on Twitter, the NFL and USA Football strangely didn’t seem interested in touting the latter result.      Jaw-dropping behavior from NFL and/or associated contractors. It's not *even* a cover-up! — Daniel Engber (@danengber) July 27, 2016      This is a story of ppl being *disinterested* in the truth. Study outcome irrelevant, even tho it's not so bad for NFL! — Daniel Engber (@danengber) July 27, 2016      What accounted for the drastic change between the widely covered preliminary findings and the final study, which was all but swept under the rug? Datalys won’t say. The Times writes:      The authors did not address how the paper’s data contradicted their preliminary conclusions from five months before. Regarding the fact that Datalys did not inform USA Football or the NFL of the discrepancies, Mr. Kerr said in an email: “Datalys stands by our decision to release preliminary data in our Feb 2015 release because if we prevented even one youth football player from suffering an injury (sprain, fracture, strain, severe contusion, or concussion), then the release was a success.” ||||| Photo      As increasing numbers of parents keep their children from playing tackle football for safety reasons, the National Football League and other groups have sought to reassure them that the game is becoming less dangerous.      No initiative has received more backing and attention than Heads Up Football, a series of in-person and online courses for coaches to learn better safety procedures and proper tackling drills. The N.F.L. funds and heavily promotes the program. The league and U.S.A. Football, youth football’s governing body, which oversees the program, have sold Heads Up Football to thousands of leagues and parents as having been proved effective — telling them that an independent study showed the program reducing injuries by 76 percent and concussions by about 30 percent.      That study, published in July 2015, showed no such thing, a review by The New York Times has found. The research and interviews with people involved with it indicate, rather, that Heads Up Football showed no demonstrable effect on concussions during the study, and significantly less effect on injuries over all, than U.S.A. Football and the league have claimed in settings ranging from online materials to congressional testimony.      As the 2016 youth football season dawns, the revelation will most likely fuel skeptics of football’s claims of reform, and discourage parents who want solid information about the sport’s risks for their children.      “Everybody who is involved in trying to improve the safety of youth sports, when parents such as myself are so desperate to have effective solutions, has the responsibility to make sure that any information that they are putting out to the public is accurate, is comprehensive, and is based on legitimate science,” said Elliot F. Kaye, the chairman of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, who has worked with U.S.A. Football and the N.F.L. on improving helmet safety. “It does not appear that this met that standard.”      Photo      Representatives of U.S.A. Football and the N.F.L. said in interviews that they had been unaware that their claims of Heads Up Football’s effectiveness were unsupported by the study, which was conducted by the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention through a 70,000 grant from U.S.A.

The program requires one “player safety coach” per team to attend a clinic that focuses on concussion recognition and response, blocking and tackling techniques, proper hydration and other safety topics. A team’s other coaches must take online courses in those subjects as well.      In March 2014, the N.F.L. gave U.S.A. Football 45 million, in large part to get more youth leagues to adopt the program.      While U.S.A. Football is said to operate independently from the N.F.L., the league is its primary source of operating funds, and some researchers consider the two almost indistinguishable.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people whose employers forbid them from creating a human-animal hybrid? from the following article ?  Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

This wasn’t just auto-filling an online form — according to various recordings tweeted from the conference, this was a phone call between Google’s AI Assistant and a human working at a salon.      But more immediately, it might be able to make calls and book your appointments in a very-natural-sounding human voice, if a recent demo is to be believed.      Google’s Assistant AI is getting better every year. It can tell you the weather, or perhaps crack a terrible joke if that’s more your speed. Give it another year or two, and it’ll be able to pre-order your lunch before you even had your morning coffee.      A machine playing the part of a human? Well someone nudge forward the Doomsday Clock, the singularity is almost here.      This is bananas. Google Assistant just called to book a haircut for someone. #io18 pic.twitter.com/gr2V0NjfiH — Daniel Bader (@journeydan) May 8, 2018      With practically no delay, Google’s AI seemed to navigate the conversation effortlessly. Granted, it didn’t take too much back-and-forth to settle on a time.      But it’s eerie to listen to. The lines between human and AI have been tremendously blurred; it’s nearly impossible to tell the cheerful salon worker from Google’s Assistant. The intonation was spot on, and far from monotonous, or robotic. The AI even threw in a couple of “uh’s” and “hmm’s,” before it answered, the way a real human would.      Whether or not it lives up to its demo, Google’s Duplex feature shows how far AI has come. But we might have to wait a bit until we can find out for ourselves. “We are still developing this technology,” CEO Sundar Pichai announced after the demo at Google I/O. Duplex will be rolled out to a limited number of testers as part of an “experiment in the coming weeks.”      Duplex wasn’t the only impressive AI feature announced at the conference. Google also announced a Smart Compose feature that can write emails for you, expanding on its “canned response”-style Smart Reply feature. Google’s AI can even colorize black-and-white photos now using machine learning and advanced object recognition. Oh, and John Legend’s silky-smooth voice could be the one to book those hair appointments for you, instead of the boring default Assistant’s.      But Duplex definitely seems to be the most impressive — and, perhaps, the most useful. I, for one, can’t wait to outsource all of my phone calls to a robotic assistant. ||||| Google CEO Sundar Pichai detailed a number of new Google Assistant features during his annual I/O keynote, the creepiest of which was an announcement that the voice assistant will be able to call up businesses on your behalf in the very near future.      The reasoning behind the new feature is pretty sound. 60% of small businesses in the US don’t offer any form of online booking, so you have to call if you want to book a haircut at a hairdresser, or a table at a restaurant.      But that’s where it gets a little bit creepy. So that you don’t have to call up the business yourself, Google has trained Assistant to be able to make the call for you.      Google’s first example was using the voice assistant to book a haircut. The user typed in what kind of haircut they’d like between what times and the assistant was able to call up and have a convincing conversation with the salon’s secretary. And by convincing we really do mean convincing.      “Powered by a new technology we call Google Duplex, the Assistant can understand complex sentences, fast speech, and long remarks, so it can respond naturally in a phone conversation,” says Google.      “Even though the calls will sound very natural, the Assistant will be clear about the intent of the call so businesses understand the context.”      Once the appointment was booked, Assistant knew to place a calendar event in the user’s Google Calendar.      A true digital assistant      The second interaction was even more impressive. Despite the fact that the restaurant didn’t accept reservations for the amount of people Google Assistant was trying to book for, the voice assistant was still able to navigate the conversation to establish that waiting times wouldn’t be too long if the party turned up that evening.      For its final trick, Pichai detailed how the Assistant could make a phone call to establish a business’s opening times, before automatically updating its listing on the search engine.      It was a pretty stunning moment from I/O, but we couldn’t help but be a little taken aback at how effective it was. The new functionality is going to be tested over the coming weeks and months, but no full release has yet been announced.      Would you trust Google Assistant to book a haircut on your behalf? Let us know @TrustedReviews. ||||| Onstage at I/O 2018, Google showed off a jaw-dropping new capability of Google Assistant: in the not too distant future, it’s going to make phone calls on your behalf. CEO Sundar Pichai played back a phone call recording that he said was placed by the Assistant to a hair salon. The voice sounded incredibly natural; the person on the other end had no idea they were talking to a digital AI helper. Google Assistant even dropped in a super casual “mmhmmm” early in the conversation.      Pichai reiterated that this was a real call using Assistant and not some staged demo. “The amazing thing is that Assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation,” he said. “We’ve been working on this technology for many years. It’s called Google Duplex.”      Duplex really feels like next-level AI stuff, but Google’s chief executive said it’s still very much under development. Google plans to conduct early testing of Duplex inside Assistant this summer “to help users make restaurant reservations, schedule hair salon appointments, and get holiday hours over the phone.”      Pichai says the Assistant can react intelligently even when a conversation “doesn’t go as expected” and veers off course a bit from the given objective. “We’re still developing this technology, and we want to work hard to get this right,” he said. “We really want it to work in cases, say, if you’re a busy parent in the morning and your kid is sick and you want to call for a doctor’s appointment.” Google has published a blog post with more details and soundbites of Duplex in action.      “The technology is directed towards completing specific tasks, such as scheduling certain types of appointments. For such tasks, the system makes the conversational experience as natural as possible, allowing people to speak normally, like they would to another person, without having to adapt to a machine.” Google envisions other use cases like having Assistant call businesses and inquire about their hours to help keep Maps listings up to date. The company says it wants to be transparent about where and when Duplex is being used, as a voice that sounds this realistic and convincing is certain to raise some questions.      In current testing, Google notes that Duplex successfully completes most conversations and tasks on its own without any intervention from a person on Google’s end. But there are cases where it gets overwhelmed and hands off to a human operator. This section on the ins and outs of Duplex is very interesting: ||||| MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google showcased its plans for the next several months as it kicked off its annual developers' conference Tuesday. Many of the new features center on the use of artificial intelligence to help save time.      Here are the highlights:      ___      MAPS: Google will use augmented reality to help guide you to your destination. When you pull up direction on Google Maps, you can look through the camera and get turn-by-turn directions while viewing the actual street. The app will also orient you and verify your position using local landmarks such as buildings and shops viewed through the camera. Google calls the technology VPS, or visual positioning system. The feature is expected this summer.      ___      GOOGLE DUPLEX: Google's digital assistant will take on the task of making appointments and other tedious calls with actual people at businesses. In two demonstrations — one setting up a hair appointment, the other a restaurant reservation — a realistic-sounding automated voice used pauses and \\"ums\\" and \\"mmm-hmms\\" to sound more human during interactions with people. Google says the technology is rolling out as \\"an experiment\\" in coming weeks.      ___      GMAIL: An autocomplete feature called \\"smart compose\\" uses artificial intelligence to suggest ways to finish sentences you start typing. For example, \\"I haven't seen you\\" might be autocompleted to \\"I haven't seen you in a while and I hope you're doing well.\\" The feature will start rolling out this month.      ___      PHOTOS: When Google recognizes a photo of someone who is one of your contacts, it can suggest sending the photo to that person. It can also convert photos to PDFs and automatically add color to black-and-white photos or make part of a color photo black and white. The changes are coming in the next few months.      ___      GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Google's digital assistant will get six new voices, including one based on that of singer John Legend, later this year. The voices aim to sound more natural and will include pauses that convey meaning. Google is also unveiling ways to let you issue multiple commands without having to say \\"Hey Google\\" each time. And it will reward kids who say \\"please,\\" similar to a feature Amazon is bringing to its Alexa voice assistant.      ___      LENS: Google's visual assistant will be built into the camera. Just point the camera at a building or sign to get more information. Or copy text from images of menus, documents and other sources into another app on your phone. Samsung phones aren't on the list of phones getting the feature starting next week. Samsung has its own version, Bixby Vision.      ___      NEWS: Google is redesigning the News feature to present five stories you need to know, plus others that it thinks will be most relevant to you. For outlets with subscriptions, Google will allow you to subscribe directly through your Google account, without needing new passwords or credit card information. The feature should be available to everyone by next week.      ___      ANDROID P: The version of Google's Android phone software will infuse basic functions with AI smarts. The battery will adapt to how you use apps in order to conserve energy. \\"Adaptive brightness\\" will learn how bright you like your screen based on manual adjustments, instead of automatically adjusting based on the how bright it is. Apple's latest system, iOS 11, has a similar feature. Owners of some Android phones — none from Samsung — can get an early test version now.      ___      WELL-BEING: Android P also includes features to combat overuse. A \\"shush\\" mode automatically turns on the \\"Do Not Disturb\\" mode when you turn your phone face down on a table. And \\"Wind Down Mode\\" will fade the screen to greyscale at a designated bed time to help you disconnect before bed. |||||","output":"Google is working on a new technology called Duplex that can help Google Assistant act like a human.

What is the answer: Who was King of England in 1400?","output":"In 1400, the King of England was King Richard II, although his reign ended later that year, being overthrown by Henry IV. Richard II, born on January 6, 1367, was the son of Edward, the Black Prince, and grandson of King Edward III. When his father died prematurely in 1376, Richard became the heir apparent to the throne. A year later, at just 10 years old, Richard found himself crowned as king after the death of his grandfather, Edward III, in 1377. Richard II's coronation marked the beginning of a tumultuous reign, characterized by frequent conflicts with the English nobility. As a minor, his early years on the throne were supervised by a series of powerful nobles acting as regents. However, as Richard came of age, he assumed greater control over the government, leading to high levels of dissatisfaction, particularly among other noble families. One of the most notable events during Richard's reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, a massive uprising against serfdom and widespread socio-economic inequalities in England. Despite being a teenager at the time, Richard demonstrated remarkable diplomatic skills during the revolt, managing to subdue the rebellion for a time by promising reforms and pardoning leaders like Wat Tyler. However, he later reneged on his promises and executed many rebels. In the 1390s, Richard became increasingly autocratic and retaliated against his perceived enemies, leading to the banishment or execution of several members of the nobility. With discontent at an all-time high, a group of nobles led by Henry Bolingbroke, the Duke of Lancaster and future King Henry IV, exiled Richard and seized the throne in 1399. On September 30, 1399, Richard II was forced to abdicate, and Henry IV was proclaimed King of England the following day. Richard was imprisoned in Pontefract Castle, where he died in 1400, most likely from starvation, although there were allegations of assassination as well. Although Richard II was the King of England at the start of 1400, his reign ended that same year with the ascension of Henry IV. It is important to note that England underwent a significant shift in power during that time, with political intrigue, conflict, and upheaval defining the transition from Richard II to Henry IV."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Matthias Wissmann warned that prolonged uncertainty could damage investment in the UK, where German manufacturers have about 100 production sites. Mr Wissmann told the BBC that the UK leaving the single market could force companies to move business elsewhere. Germany also exports more vehicles to the UK than any other country. Mr Wissmann, president of the German Automotive Association, said: \\"We need, relatively soon, a clear answer... Will we have tariff and non-tariff barriers between Britain on the one hand and the European Union? \\"That means a long period of uncertainties will block future investments in Britain, and that makes me really concerned. \\"Therefore I hope that the British government, at a certain crossroads within the next 12 months, decides to go for the single market and not for any other regime which would need years to discuss and negotiate. \\"Five or 10 years of uncertainties would be not very positive for both sides, the European Union and Britain.\\" On Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis described his meeting with the European Parliament's chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt as a \\"good start\\". Although they could not negotiate yet, he said their discussions had been able to cover structures and how both sides propose to approach the Brexit talks. He said a deal was possible that was in the interests of the EU and the UK. Mr Verhofstadt said he wanted an exit deal completed before the next European Parliament elections in 2019.

NHL Legend Mike Bossy -- My Super Rare Puck Is On eBay ... And I Want It Back!! NY Islanders Hall of Famer Mike Bossy is eyeing a legendary NHL puck on eBay, but refuses to pay a dime -- 'cause in his mind he's the rightful owner, and he's pissed someone's trying to sell it off. Here's the deal ... in 1981, Bossy scored 50 goals in 50 games -- a feat only accomplished by 4 other players -- but about 30 years ago the treasured 50th puck slipped out of his hands. We spoke to the eBay seller, Jake Jacobson ... a HUGE Islanders fan and former swim coach, who claims he ended up with the prized puck when Bossy's young daughter gave it to him as a thank you for her swimming lessons. A couple years ago he contacted Bossy and offered to return it, but claims Bossy \\"didn't really seem interested.\\" He says Bossy offered him a signed stick and that's about it. \\"He couldn't even meet. It just wasn't a good offer.\\" So, now Jacobson's gone the eBay route, and Bossy's ready to drop the gloves.

Governor Palin won the award for fighting the Department of Interior 's designation of the polar bear as a threatened species . The polar bear is threatened by a shrinking habitat due to global warming . Answer the following question: How has global warming affected Polar bear habitats ?","output":"Global warming has had significant and far-reaching effects on polar bear habitats over the past few decades. As temperatures rise, the Arctic has been experiencing rapid and unprecedented changes, leading to a loss of sea ice, alterations in prey availability, and shifts in the physical and biological characteristics of the polar bear's environment. This complex chain of events has left polar bears facing an increasingly precarious existence in their natural habitats. 1. Loss of sea ice: One of the most crucial consequences of global warming on the polar bear's habitat is the reduction of sea ice. Sea ice serves as a vital platform for polar bears, allowing them to hunt, breed, and migrate. As temperatures increase, the extent and thickness of the sea ice have been steadily declining, leading to shorter hunting seasons and reduced access to prey. This decline in sea ice has resulted in fragmented and thinner ice, which, in turn, has affected the polar bears' ability to find food. 2. Changes in prey availability: Polar bears primarily rely on seals, such as the ringed seal and the bearded seal, as their main food source. With the reduction in sea ice, these seals have experienced changes in their own habitats and population distributions. The disappearance of sea ice platforms has made seals less accessible to polar bears, leading to more difficult and less successful hunting endeavors. As a result, polar bears have been forced to expend more energy and travel greater distances to find food, causing increased stress on their bodies and reduced chances of survival. 3. Shifts in the physical environment: Global warming has led to changes in the physical characteristics of the Arctic environment. For example, melting glaciers and ice caps are contributing to rising sea levels, potentially inundating coastal habitats and denning areas. Moreover, the thinning sea ice has caused an increase in ice-free seasons, leading to the opening of new navigational routes for marine vessels. This development can potentially increase the risk of oil spills, which could pose a serious threat to the polar bears' habitat and survival. 4. Changes in the biological environment: Global warming has also led to shifts in the biological communities of the Arctic. This includes changes in the distribution, abundance, and behavior of various plant and animal species, some of which are critical to the polar bear's survival. One example is the decline in numbers of Arctic ice algae, a primary source of food for zooplankton, which forms the base of the Arctic marine food chain. This decline can have a ripple effect on the food web, impacting the availability of prey for polar bears in the long term. 5. Increased competition and stress: As a consequence of the habitat changes brought about by global warming, polar bears now face increased competition for the limited resources available to them. With less available food, the competition between polar bears for mates and territory intensifies, leading to increased aggression and stress among individuals. Such increased stress on the polar bear population further weakens their ability to adapt to the changing environment. In summary, global warming has significantly impacted the polar bear's habitat by accelerating the loss of sea ice, altering the availability of their primary prey, and causing various shifts in the Arctic's physical and biological environment. As their habitat continues to shrink, polar bears face increased stress, competition, and threats to their survival. Urgent and comprehensive efforts must be undertaken to mitigate the effects of global warming on the Arctic ecosystem to protect the polar bear populations and preserve their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would \\"Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs), each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere , so that handedness , or the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\\" be a reasonable answer?  [+] No; [+] Yes; The answer is:","output":"No; the given statement does not directly address the names of the parts of a hand, as it primarily focuses on the brain's control of the hand and the concept of handedness. A more appropriate response would be to provide a detailed description of the parts of a hand. Here is a suggestion: The human hand is a complex and versatile structure with a variety of components that work seamlessly together to enable our daily activities. These components include bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels, which can be further broken down into specific parts. 1. Bones: The hand consists of 27 bones that are divided into three categories:    - Carpals: These are eight small bones located in the wrist area called the carpal tunnel. They are arranged in two rows, helping connect the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) to the metacarpals.    - Metacarpals: Five long bones form the middle part of the hand and connect the carpals to the phalanges (finger bones). They are numbered I-V, with the I being the thumb and the V being the little finger.    - Phalanges (singular: phalanx): These are the 14 individual bones that make up the fingers and thumb. Each finger has three phalanges (proximal, middle, and distal), while the thumb has only two (proximal and distal). 2. Muscles: The muscles of the hand are responsible for its movement. They can be classified into two groups:    - Extrinsic muscles: These muscles originate in the forearm and insert into the hand via long tendons that pass through the wrist. They help in controlling gross motor functions like gripping, pinching, and flexing/extending the wrist and fingers.    - Intrinsic muscles: These smaller muscles originate within the hand itself and are responsible for fine motor functions, such as precise finger movements and opposition of the thumb. They can be further subdivided into three groups: thenar (thumb side), hypothenar (pinky side), and intermediate intrinsic muscles. 3. Tendons and ligaments: Tendons are the fibrous bands that connect muscles to bones, while ligaments connect bones to other bones, providing support and stability to the joints.    - Flexor tendons: Present on the palm side of the hand, they enable the fingers and thumb to bend (flex).    - Extensor tendons: Found on the back (dorsal) side of the hand, they facilitate the straightening (extension) of the fingers and thumb.    - Ligaments: They stabilize the joints and bones at the wrist, metacarpals, and phalanges. 4. Nerves: There are three major nerves in the hand, which control sensation and muscle function.    - Median nerve: Provides sensation to the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger, as well as motor function to the thenar muscles.    - Ulnar nerve: Serves the pinky and half of the ring finger, along with the hypothenar muscles and some intrinsic muscles.    - Radial nerve: Primarily responsible for wrist and thumb extension, and sensation to the back of the hand and fingers. 5. Blood vessels: The main arteries (radial and ulnar) supply blood to the hand, while the veins help to return the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In conclusion, the hand is a complex anatomical structure that includes bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels. The given statement about brain hemisphere control and handedness does not specifically address the parts of the hand; however, it highlights the intricacies of hand function and the brain's involvement in controlling our hand movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

China lifted its more than three-decade-old family planning policy, according to a statement issued on Thursday by the Communist Party of China Central Committee, under which roughly 90 million couples will become eligible to have a second child.      The estimate is based on the prediction that each child brings an average of 30,000 yuan expense each year, Liang Jianzhang, professor of economics at Peking University, told Securities Times. He added that the government is expected to expand its annual infrastructural investment by 225 billion yuan over the next five to 10 years.      A woman plays with a girl on a street outside the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Nov 8, 2013.[Zou Hong/Asianewsphoto]      The latest move comes amid the nation's changing demographics, which could lead to potential labor shortages in the future if not addressed.      The statement said the China's aging trend would be actively addressed by the national two-child policy, and that it would continue to stick to the family planning policy as a basic State interest.      \\"This policy change could have a positive impact on demographics, and hence the economic outlook, but any such impact will only crystallize over the long term,\\" Atsi Sheth, associate managing director of Moody’s, noted in a report on Friday.      In late 2013, the government first relaxed the family planning policy, allowing couples to have a second child in situations where one spouse was an only child. However, as of June, only 1.5 million of the 11 million eligible couples had applied to have a second child.      The country has suffered from low fertility rate, with the ratio hitting the bottom at 1.18 in 2010 and only slightly rebounding to 1.24 in 2013, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. A minimum of 2.1 is required to replace an aging population, experts said.

The Inner Mongolia Higher People's Court said yesterday that Huugjilt, who was 18 when he was killed by firing squad in 1996, was innocent.      \\"We learned a heartbreaking lesson in this case; we are sorry,\\" said Zhao Jianping, the court's deputy president. He presented 30,000 yuan (HK37,960) to the parents as an expression of \\"sympathy\\", according to Xinhua.      Huugjilt's parents later visited his grave, where they burned a copy of the verdict \\"to tell him that the wrongful conviction has been redressed\\", the family said on its Weibo account.      His 62-year-old mother broke into tears in front of the grave. \\"I knew you were innocent, but I could not help you; I miss you so much,\\" she said, according to video carried on the website of The Beijing News.      The court said it would set up a team to investigate the officials involved in the case.      The acquittal came three days after the Supreme People's Court ordered the Shandong Provincial Higher Court to review another controversial case. Nie Shubin was convicted of raping and murdering a woman in 1994 and was executed the following year. He was 21.      In 2005, a man arrested for a separate crime, Wang Shujin, confessed to the murder. The top court in Hebei , where Nie was executed, said it would review the case but there has been little progress in nine years.      The judicial system has been criticised as lacking independence, with government officials regularly steering court decisions, and prosecutors using \\"confessions\\" obtained through police torture.      Xu Xin, a law professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, had long pushed for reviews of the two cases. He said that without fundamental reform to improve judicial independence, \\"there will be more wrongful convictions even though some are being redressed\\".      He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University, said the two reviews were landmarks but little had been done to reform the judiciary. \\"There's no change to the problems in the system, such as inadequate judicial independence, government intervention, too much power in police hands, an unclear accountability mechanism and wide use of torture.\\"      Huugjilt's case drew wide public interest after a series of media reports, later supported by legal experts, claiming the information presented to the court was flawed. Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said the public sympathised with Huugjilt and Nie because they were executed at a young age.      Huugjilt was found guilty of raping and murdering the woman in a public toilet in Hohhot on April 9, 1996. He was sentenced to death and executed two months later. In 2005, an alleged serial rapist and killer, Zhao Zhihong, told police he had carried out the crime. But a retrial was held only in November. ||||| BEIJING China on Monday exonerated a teenager executed more than 18 years ago for the rape and murder of a woman, drawing approval from judicial reform advocates who saw his death as a symbol of the miscarriage of justice in capital punishment cases.      A retrial by an Inner Mongolian court found that Huugjilt, then 18 years old, was wrongly convicted in 1996 of raping and killing a woman in a public restroom.      Another man confessed to the murder in 2005, but a retrial was not conducted until this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported.      A court official apologized to Huugjilt's sobbing parents, who had been petitioning judicial authorities since 2006 to re-try the case, state media reported.      China has embarked on legal reforms, including reducing the use of death penalty, as public discontent mounts over wrongful punishment.      \\"This shows the spirit behind judicial reform in our country and that the will to pursue justice exists - that's a good thing,\\" said Chen Guangzhong, a top scholar of criminal law at the China University of Political Science and Law.      Chen added, however, that there remain significant obstacles to reform of the death penalty and that abolishing capital punishment completely is unlikely at present.      The decision to exonerate Huugjilt was the most talked-about topic on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, with 84,000 comments.      Huugjilt's family could not be reached for comment. Many ethnic Mongols in China use only one name.      While wrongful executions have often stirred public outrage, capital punishment itself has wide support from the Chinese public.      China guards the number of people executed annually as a state secret but anti-death penalty campaigners say it uses the death penalty in far greater numbers than other countries.      \\"Death penalty cases have been subjected to closer scrutiny in recent years, in large part in a response to domestic outcry in cases of individuals who are convicted of serious crimes like murder and rape who are found later to be innocent,\\" said Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch.      The government has tightened rules on evidence to exclude confessions obtained through torture, although torture is still widely used, Wang said. China denies that the practice is widespread and says a torture ban is effectively enforced.      China said in October it is considering trimming nine crimes from the list of offences punishable by death in a draft amendment to the criminal law.      The death penalty applies to 55 offences in China, including fraud and illegal money-lending.

Different meanings In the given two sentences, the word 'pain' represents different meanings, depending on the context in which it is being used. In the first sentence, \\"The pain of loneliness,\\" the word 'pain' refers to the emotional or psychological distress that one feels when they are lonely. Loneliness can often lead to feelings of sadness, emptiness, and discomfort in social situations, and these emotions are described metaphorically as 'pain.' In this context, pain doesn't refer to a physical sensation; rather, it signifies the emotional turmoil that results from being alone or feeling isolated from others. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"The patient developed severe pain and distension,\\" the word 'pain' denotes a physical sensation of discomfort, often resulting from an injury, illness, or other medical conditions. Here, the use of 'pain' implies that the patient is experiencing a tangible sensation, which may be sharp, throbbing, stinging, or aching, and it may be continuous or intermittent. This kind of pain is usually associated with the nerves and the body's sensory system, which allows the person to feel and perceive physical discomfort.

Airport dining doesn't have to be terminal. A new wave of airport restaurants is elevating airport cuisine above the level of greasy burgers and wilting sushi, as celebrity chefs and regional food heroes bring their magic to the one-time culinary wasteland of the airport. Many of the chefs involved are Michelin-starred, and their offerings rate alongside the finest restaurants in their cities.

Across the industry, there is a broader recognition that many among the captive audience of travelers are looking for something more substantial than simply filling a hole in their stomachs, and would place a premium on quality food in stylish surroundings. Industry awards such as those made by Skytrax include categories recognizing the best airport restaurant offerings. This year the top five awards went to Hong Kong International, London Heathrow, Munich, Singapore Changi and Amsterdam Schiphol, in that order.

The paragraph merely states that Craig Conway was terminated from his position as CEO at PeopleSoft prior to its acquisition by Oracle and does not present a direct link or causality between Oracle's desires and Conway's termination. Without additional information, it remains unclear whether Conway's removal was initiated by Oracle or by the internal dynamics within PeopleSoft, or even other external factors. Mergers and acquisitions typically involve extensive planning and negotiation, which often includes discussions about the management structure post-acquisition. However, the paragraph does not provide explicit details about these aspects. It's also important to note that the CEO of a company is typically chosen by the company's board of directors. Therefore, Conway's dismissal could be due to a range of reasons including unsatisfactory performance, disagreements with the board on the company's direction, unethical conduct, and so on. We cannot definitively conclude whether Oracle was a factor in this decision. To confirm the sentence \\"Oracle wanted Conway gone\\", we would need more data or assertions directly linking Oracle's intentions towards Craig Conway's role at PeopleSoft. This could be a formal statement from Oracle or PeopleSoft's authorities, records of pertinent meetings, or reliable third-party reports showcasing Oracle's involvement in the management change.    However, relying solely on the information given, we can only infer that Craig Conway was removed from his post as CEO before PeopleSoft was bought by Oracle, but we cannot assertively conclude that Oracle wanted or caused this change in leadership."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Sting Context: The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression. Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago. Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to con Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as \\"the wire\\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win 15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting. Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker.

Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? What country of origin does Strait of Dover and Dutch language have in common? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the country associated with the Strait of Dover - The Strait of Dover is the narrowest part of the English Channel, which separates England and France. Step 2: Identify the country associated with the Dutch language - The Dutch language is primarily spoken in the Netherlands. Step 3: Determine if there is a common country of origin between the two - The Strait of Dover is not directly associated with the Netherlands, but it connects the North Sea, at the border of the Netherlands, to the English Channel. Additionally, the Dutch language and Strait of Dover both have historical connections to the region due to maritime and trade activities. Step 4: Consider a possible indirect link between the two - Given the geographical proximity of the countries in the region, it is possible to indirectly link the Netherlands with the Strait of Dover through their shared history and maritime connections.

It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico.  - The San Francisco Peninsula is a peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area that separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. On its northern tip is the City and County of San Francisco. Its southern base is in northern Santa Clara County, including the cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View and Los Altos. Most of the Peninsula is occupied by San Mateo County, between San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, and including the cities and towns of Atherton, Belmont, Brisbane, Burlingame, Colma, Daly City, East Palo Alto, El Granada, Foster City, Hillsborough, Half Moon Bay, La Honda, Menlo Park, Millbrae, Pacifica, Portola Valley, Redwood City, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Mateo, South San Francisco, and Woodside.  - The San Francisco Bay is a shallow estuary that drains water from approximately 40% of California. Water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and from the Sierra Nevada mountains, passes through the bay to the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, both rivers flow into Suisun Bay, which flows through the Carquinez Strait to meet with the Napa River at the entrance to San Pablo Bay, which connects at its south end to San Francisco Bay. However, the entire group of interconnected bays is often called the \\"San Francisco Bay\\".  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - Hopkins Marine Station is the marine laboratory of Stanford University. It is located ninety miles south of the university's main campus, in Pacific Grove, California (United States) on the Monterey Peninsula, adjacent to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It is home to nine research laboratories and a fluctuating population of graduate and undergraduate students. It has also been used for archaeological exploration including that of the Chinese-American fishing village that existed on the site before being burnt down.  - The Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) is a non-profit public aquarium located in Monterey, California, United States. The aquarium was founded in 1984 and is located on the site of a former sardine cannery on Cannery Row. It has an annual attendance of around two million visitors. It holds thousands of plants and animals, representing more than 600 species on display. The aquarium benefits from a high circulation of fresh ocean water which is obtained through pipes which pump it in continuously from Monterey Bay.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - The term \\"microbiologist\\" comes from the Greek \\"mkros\\" meaning \\"small\\" , and \\"bios\\", meaning \\"life\\" , combined with \\"-logia\\" meaning one who studies. A microbiologist (from Greek ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology. Microbiologists investigate the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and some types of parasites and their vectors. They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms. Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities, such as a laboratory as well as in the academia. There, they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance. A microbiologist's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research. Most microbiologists specialize in environmental, food, agricultural, industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including: virology (the study of viruses); immunology (the study of mechanisms that fight infections); bioinformatics (the methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data) and Bioremediation (using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies). Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease. Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes. While others, study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners.   - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.  - Northern California, often abbreviated NorCal, is the northern portion of the U.S. state of California. Spanning the state's northernmost 48 counties, in contrast to the 10 counties of Southern California, its main population centers include the San Francisco Bay Area (anchored by the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), the Greater Sacramento area (anchored by the state capital Sacramento), and the Metropolitan Fresno area (anchored by the city of Fresno). Northern California also contains redwood forests, along with the Sierra Nevada including Yosemite Valley and part of Lake Tahoe, Mount Shasta (the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington), and the northern portion of the Central Valley, one of the world's most productive agricultural regions.  - The San Francisco Bay Area (referred to locally as the Bay Area) is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco and San Pablo estuaries in Northern California. The region encompasses the major cities and metropolitan areas of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland, along with smaller urban and rural areas. The Bay Area's nine counties are Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. Home to approximately 7.65 million people, the nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and associated regional, state, and national parks, connected by a network of roads, highways, railroads, bridges, tunnels and commuter rail. The combined statistical area of the region is the second-largest in California (after the Greater Los Angeles area), the fifth-largest in the United States, and the 43rd-largest urban area in the world.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Michael Doudoroff ( 1911 - 1975 ) was an American microbiologist who discovered with Nathan Entner microbial pathway for glucose degradation in some bacteria . Nowadays it is known as Entner -- Doudoroff pathway . He was born in St. Petersburg , Russia but moved to San Francisco when he was 12 years old . He entered Stanford University ( 1929 ) where he completed his PhD under the supervision of Cornelius Van Niel at the Hopkins Marine Station .  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations.

The song of the wind.","output":"To determine whether \\"song\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, let's analyze each sentence and the context of the word: 1. The song of bullets was in the air. In this sentence, \\"song\\" seems to be used as a metaphor to describe the sound of bullets flying through the air. It is not a literal song with melody and lyrics; rather, it is a description of the particular noise the bullets make. 2. The song of the wind. Here, \\"song\\" also appears to be a metaphor. It is describing the sound the wind makes as it moves through the environment. Like the first sentence, it is not a literal song but a way to describe the natural sound. Conclusion: In both sentences, \\"song\\" carries a metaphorical meaning referring to a particular sound associated with an object or phenomenon (bullets and wind, respectively).

Please answer the following question: This article: The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Skylar would need to take the car to a mechanic. If Skylar has adequate resources or insurance that covers engine damage, then the engine could get fixed or replaced. This step would restore the car back to its working condition. 2) Financial Implications: The repair or replacement of a car engine can be expensive, depending on the extent of the damage. If Skylar doesn't have insurance coverage for this matter, it might pose a financial strain.  3) Alternative Transportation: With the car broken down, Skylar would need to find an alternate mode of transportation. This could be public transport, carpooling, rental cars, or even purchasing a new vehicle if the current one is beyond repair or not worth the cost of repair. 4) Schedule Disruptions: Skylar's daily routine might be disrupted. The time taken to repair the car and to arrange alternative transportation could interfere with Skylar's work schedule or personal commitments. 5) Impact on Dependents: If Skylar has dependents that rely on the car (eg., for dropping and picking up kids from school or for running errands), they will also be affected until the car is fixed or replaced. 6) Emergency Preparedness: Depending on Skylar's situation, being without a car could impact his/her ability to respond to an emergency. Hence, the discovery of a broken engine will likely lead to a series of actions for Skylar - Garnering resources to fix the engine, finding alternative transport means, navigating potential disruptions in schedule, and managing impacts on dependents and overall lifestyle. How severely Skylar is affected will largely depend on his/her personal circumstances, resourcefulness, and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Greene: One can marvel at, use digital media, but save spot in your heart for beauty of paper. Article:","output":"Title: The Enduring Beauty of Paper in the Digital Age Introduction In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the humble paper often finds itself overlooked and undervalued. Bob Greene, an advocate of traditional paper use, has witnessed a significant decline in the demand for paper products. He notes that there has been a 21% drop in paper usage by 2015 and stoically predicts a further decline of over 40% during the subsequent 15 years. However, Greene passionately makes a case for the continued appreciation of the elegant simplicity of paper in today's digitally-focused world. The Unwavering Charm of Paper Even as more and more information shifts to digital platforms, Greene asserts that the allure of paper ought not to be dismissed. An eternal source of inspiration, paper brings a unique warmth and character that cannot be precisely replicated by digital mediums. From the tactile experience of turning the pages of a well-loved book to the personal touch of a handwritten letter, the understated beauty of paper endures. The New Advertising Campaign In an attempt to preserve and promote the value of paper, Greene reveals the launch of a captivating new advertising campaign. Interestingly, this campaign is primarily accessible online, highlighting the fact that digital media and paper are not mutually exclusive. The objective of the campaign is to encourage people to acknowledge the importance of paper and appreciate its enduring qualities, even as they engage with cutting-edge digital technologies. Embracing Both Worlds Greene emphasizes that one can fully embrace the innovations of the digital age while still preserving a place in one's heart for the dependable beauty of paper. The two seemingly disparate formats can quite easily complement each other, combining their respective strengths to deliver a more enriching and versatile experience for users. Conclusion As the digital age continues to advance at lightning speed, Bob Greene's impassioned plea for a continued appreciation of paper serves as a gentle reminder of its timeless appeal. By acknowledging the virtues of both digital and traditional paper mediums, a harmonious balance can be struck that caters to the changing tastes and preferences of modern-day users.

The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey (Lily Holleman) is not as unpopular as Maggie is due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invite on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy click, including Liz (Liz McGeever), a very hated but feared girl at school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice versa. Louis leaves and Casey appears at the same time as Tara (Kimberly Matula) the sweet Queen Bee at school to wipe food off her shirt as well. Tara asks if Maggie is as clutzy as she is which Maggie confirms that she is. After she leaves Casey makes a remark about how Tara is only nice so she can win Homecoming Queen to which Maggie replies that it would be nice if she herself were to win Homecoming Queen and not somebody like Tara or her friends. Liz overhears and decides to nominate Maggie as a joke. The joke is on her though as many students get excited about Maggie being the queen, including Tara, who is, of course, nominated herself.

(AP) — The Tennessee Senate passed a resolution Monday that would allow the body of former President James K. Polk to be exhumed and moved to a fourth resting place.      Polk and his wife, Sarah, are currently buried on the grounds of the state Capitol.      The resolution would allow the bodies to be exhumed and moved about 50 miles south to Columbia to the grounds of the James K. Polk Home and Museum.      The proposal has riled some folks in Tennessee who think the move desecrates the body of the nation's 11th president. The state historian objects to the move, and the descendants of the former president are pitted against one another. Others believe the move would more appropriately honor the president who played a central role in helping expand the U.S. across the continent.      The former president left a will saying he wanted to be buried at Polk Place, his mansion in Nashville. But sickness, a legal battle over the estate and the eventual sale of Polk Place outside the family meant he couldn't have his wish.      Polk, a former Tennessee governor, died of cholera in June of 1849, just three months after leaving the White House. He was originally laid to rest in what is now the Nashville City Cemetery because of an ordinance that said people who died of infectious diseases had to be buried on the outskirts of town within 24 hours.      His body was later moved to Polk Place, but that wouldn't last. The Polks were dug up and moved to the Capitol after the mansion was sold after their deaths.      The vote, which was 20-6, is the first of several steps necessary to actually move the bodies, including court approval and the blessing of the Tennessee Historical Society. |||||       The burial place of President James K. Polk and his wife, Sarah Polk, is seen on the grounds of the state Capitol in Nashville (AP/Erik Schelzig)      A few months after leaving office in 1849, President James K. Polk died at the Nashville mansion that he called Polk Place. Because the 11th president came down with a lethal bout of cholera, his body was buried for a year in a mass grave in the Nashville City Cemetery, in adherence to laws meant to prevent infectious diseases spreading from corpses.      The cemetery was the first of Polk’s “final” resting places. The saga of his remains, more than 150 years later, continues still. On Monday the Tennessee Senate passed a resolution to once again relocate his grave.      But it would be premature for diggers to ready their shovels. The state’s House of Representatives, the Davidson County Chancery Court and the Tennessee Historical Commission must also approve the resolution.      And if Polk goes to his fourth grave, it will not be quietly. A few of his descendants have decried the move as a poor way to honor the president.      “Every step they take is one step toward grave robbery,” Teresa Elam, 65, Polk’s niece by way of seven generations, told the Tennessean. “It would be like taking someone out of Arlington and taking them to the family farm and putting them behind the barn.”      After first being buried for a year in the city cemetery, the president’s relatives moved his body to the Polk Place grounds, in keeping with the will he wrote before he died. Despite that will, the Polk family sold that land in 1893 after a legal battle. The bodies of Polk and his wife, Sarah Childress Polk, were then moved to the grounds of the Tennessee capitol.      He has rested in that spot for more than a century. The Senate’s resolution would allow for the Polks’ bodies to be exhumed and relocated to 45 minutes away to his former residence in Columbia, Tenn., where the president spent part of his childhood and the James K. Polk Home and Museum is located.      “We are doing our best to preserve and interpret the legacy of James K. Polk, because that’s what he would have wanted in his will,” curator Tom Price told the Tennessean.      But Elam — Polk’s distant relative — considers the move a moneymaking ploy to drive tourists to Columbia, the New York Times reported.      Price disputed that the move was meant to drum up more sales of the 10 admission tickets. “We’ve been open since 1929,” Price told CBS News. “If this were merely a matter of money we probably would have done it 50 years ago.”      Joey Hensley, a Republican state senator who represents the county where the museum is located, sponsored the bill to move Polk. He said Polk’s current burial place is tucked away in a corner of the capitol grounds, a disservice to the president, in his view.      “I think I have been here 14 years and really didn’t know, had never visited James K. Polk’s tomb,” Hensley told the Associated Press.      Jeff Yarbro, a Democratic state senator for Nashville, told CBS that he would prefer legislators to tread lightly around presidential corpses.      “There are only 45 people who’ve been president of the United States,” he said, “and if a few years from now there’s a crew with shovels in the front yard of the capitol, it’s going to be a national news story, and there’s going to be a lot of appropriate scrutiny on how this process got initiated.”      Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the name of the historical organization that must approve the resolution. It is the Tennessee Historical Commission, not the Tennessee Historical Society.

Polk was the nation's 11th president, serving from 1845 to 1849.      Polk grew up in Columbia. After leaving the White House, Polk settled in Nashville, only to die a few months later.      First, he was buried in the Nashville City Cemetery. Then at his home, Polk Place.      Later, his remains were moved to the state Capitol after a family dispute.      There is still a fight about where to bury President James K. Polk.      Nearly 168 years after he died and more than a century since the last time his body was exhumed and relocated, there's yet another battle underway over whether to move his remains — this time, from the state Capitol in Nashville to the Polk family home 50 miles south in Columbia.      The dispute has pitted descendants against one another, with one saying the move is a \\"step toward grave robbery.\\" But supporters, including some state lawmakers, say relocating his body will better preserve his legacy. The state Senate is expected to take up a resolution next week, a first step in relocating Polk's remains.      \\"He’s a president from Tennessee, and he deserves respect,\\" said Tom Price, the curator of the James K. Polk Home and Museum in Columbia.      So how did it come to this, the latest chapter in the bizarre saga behind Polk’s remains? There's even a new Twitter account — Polk Journey Home — set up this month to support the move to Columbia.      Born in North Carolina, Polk grew up in Columbia. He served in the state House, U.S. House and later became Tennessee's ninth governor before his election to the presidency. After leaving office, Polk settled in Nashville only to die suddenly of cholera in 1849, just a few months after leaving the White House.      To prevent further spread of the cholera epidemic, the former president was buried — with honors — in the Nashville City Cemetery. But about a year later, his body was exhumed and moved to Polk Place, his Nashville home that once sat at the corner of Union Avenue and Seventh Street. His wife, Sarah Childress Polk, insisted the casket be opened so she could confirm that the body unearthed from the “makeshift mausoleum” was indeed the nation's 11th president.      A couple of years after her death in 1891, a family disagreement forced the courts to toss out the former president's will — which called for his burial at Polk Place — and order the home sold. It was then that Polk's remains moved to the Capitol.      More: Read Polk's will as printed in a 1956 Tennessee Historical Quarterly article      Today, Polk is buried among a grove of trees on the east lawn of the Capitol, the northernmost on a row of memorials to Tennessee’s most influential political figures. Polk Place no longer exists, long since razed. The Capitol Hotel now sits on the site.      The possibility of another move has many family members distraught.      \\"Every step they take is one step toward grave robbery,” said Teresa Elam, a seventh-generation niece of Polk from Wilson County. “It would be like taking someone out of Arlington (National Cemetery) and taking them to the family farm and putting them behind the barn.\\"      Elam and sixth-generation first cousin Bill Mason are among several descendants who are opposing the move, saying it’s “degrading” to the memory of Polk.      Academics and historians say there's a peculiar, perhaps metaphorical link between the fight over where his body should lie and the type of person and leader Polk was when he was alive.      As president, Polk is regarded as one who accomplished everything he promised to do — a rhetoric commonly found in American politics, even today — but often loses when compared to Andrew Jackson, the nation's seventh president, in terms of significance.      Most suggest Tennessee's greatest president is Jackson, but \\"you could make a powerful case that Polk was a more consequential president than Jackson,\\" said Thomas Schwarz, a Vanderbilt University history professor.      And the debate over his remains parallels that endless and existential conversation, he said.      \\"It’s the desire to be identified with a president who accomplished a great deal,\\" Schwarz said.      Why they want to move Polk      For the past 20 years, Price has worked to preserve Polk's legacy.      “One of the questions we would get is ‘Well, where is he buried?' ” Price said.      After residents and guests of the Polk museum approached him about moving the body from Nashville to Columbia a few months ago, Price made presentations and held town halls to gauge community interest. He approached state lawmakers to begin the long process of potentially moving the body.      State Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, who currently represents Columbia, and Sen. Bill Ketron, R-Murfreesboro, whose district contained Columbia for a decade when he was first in the Senate, say they support the move and have been reassured by descendants they support the relocation.      \\"I think it would be excellent to have him there,\\" Ketron said, adding that much of the Polk family history, including personal belongings and family relics, remains at the complex in Columbia. Polk did not have any children, but had eight brothers and sisters, most of whom lived in Columbia.      \\"The experience of all of that makes sense to me, and I support it,\\" Ketron said.      Ketron said he's talked to descendants on both sides of the issue, with some wanting the Polks to remain at the Capitol and others wanting the remains to move to Columbia.      In death, Polk still falls behind his predecessor and good friend Jackson. The Hermitage, Jackson's nearby home, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The Polk home gets only a few dozen.      Price hopes moving the body back to Columbia will change that.      But he dismisses criticism that the move is a business decision to bring more tourism to Maury County.      “We are doing our best to preserve and interpret the legacy of James K. Polk, because that’s what he would have wanted in his will,\\" Price said.      “This is really our attempt at changing that and raising awareness.\\"      Polk’s will originally stated that he was to be buried at the garden at Polk Place.      “He wanted to be buried at Polk Place, and the will has been thrown out by the Davidson County court,” State Librarian Eddie Weeks said.      While initially hesitant to move the remains, Polk's fourth great-nephew James K. Polk Van Zandt came around after talking with Price and examining the president's old diaries. He wants his ancestor to go back with his legacy and memorabilia.      “The only home that he lived in that’s still standing is his home in Columbia,\\" he said. \\"Except the White House, and I don’t think they’ll want him there.”      Why they want Polk to stay      Mason said calling the residence in Columbia Polk's \\"boyhood home\\" is not accurate because Polk left for college when it was built.      \\"How can you make the case that it's his boyhood home when it wasn't built until he was 21 years old when he was away at law school?\\" Mason said. “That argument, I think, is ridiculous on its face.\\"      Polk did grow up in Columbia but lived in multiple homes.      Elam said there's also a \\"family rumor\\" that the reason Polk moved to Nashville after his presidency was to stay involved in Tennessee politics, making the city a logical location for his remains. She said the family Bible confirms historical records that the Polks were creating a sort of museumlike estate at Polk Place for when they died.      Elam said she's spoken to more than a dozen other descendants who are just as upset as she is. She described relocating the remains as \\"despicable\\" and only \\"using remains for a pony show.\\" Mason said it's rare for any set of remains to be moved, much less three times.      \\"I wouldn't want any relative of mine — lowly or high-born — treated that way,\\" Mason said.      Elam and Mason said there are very few ideas in their mind that would sway them. The only suggestion Elam offered would be to create a \\"complete total perfect replica\\" in Columbia of the memorial that lies on the Capitol grounds.      \\"All three of our presidents are lined up in honor down there,\\" Mason said. \\"To me, that's a wonderful thing.\\"      Jake Lowary covers the statehouse and politics for USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee.

Getting a dog is a significant decision and brings countless benefits to your life, including companionship, protection, and an opportunity for regular exercise. Bringing a dog into your life can lead to an immeasurable amount of joy, but it also requires a lot of planning, responsibility, and dedication. Here is some valuable information to consider when you've decided to get a dog. First and foremost, it is essential to research different breeds and understand their unique characteristics, physical traits, and behavioral tendencies. It would be best to consider your lifestyle, activity level, and living situation when choosing a breed. If you lead an energetic lifestyle, you may want to consider a sporting or working breed. However, a more sedentary lifestyle may mean a smaller, less energetic breed would be a better fit. When selecting a breed, think about your living arrangements and if the dog will have enough space to thrive. Once you have determined which breed is suitable for you, the next step is to decide whether you want a puppy or an adult dog. Puppies will require focused training, extra attention, and more time dedicated to establishing a routine. On the other hand, adult dogs may already have basic training and established habits, which can make the transition easier. You should also decide whether you want to adopt from a shelter or rescue group or buy from a breeder. If you decide to adopt, visit local shelters or rescue organizations to find dogs that need homes. These dogs often come from various backgrounds, and adopting one can provide them with a loving, forever home. Rescue dogs might have behavioral quirks or health issues, but the organization should provide you with information about the dog's history and needs. Adopting a dog can be a fulfilling experience, and responsible adoption practices help save lives. When choosing a reputable breeder, do your research and ask for recommendations from friends, family, or local breed clubs. A responsible breeder will provide you with information about the dog's pedigree, breed standards, temperament, and health. Make sure that the breeder conducts health screening tests and raises dogs in a clean, safe environment. It's essential to visit the breeder and meet the puppy's parents to gain insight into the dog's potential temperament and physical characteristics. Once you have found your new furry companion, it's essential to prepare your home before their arrival. Create a designated living space for your dog, including a comfortable bed, food and water bowls, toys, and grooming supplies. Establish a daily routine for feeding, walking, and playing to help your new pet acclimate to its new environment. Veterinary care is crucial for maintaining your dog's health. Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian who is familiar with your chosen breed's specific health concerns. Ensure your dog receives vaccinations and parasite prevention treatments. It's also crucial to have your dog spayed or neutered, as it provides health benefits and helps control the pet population. Socialization and training are essential elements in raising a well-rounded, well-behaved dog. Enroll your dog in obedience classes or seek the guidance of a professional dog trainer. Expose your dog to various people, other animals, and different environments to build their confidence and help them become a well-mannered, adaptable pet. All in all, making the decision to get a dog is an exciting journey. By preparing for and understanding the responsibility, you will undoubtedly create a loving bond with your new pet that will flourish for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The central character of Kodiak is the draw for this series and while I did finish this book, the temptation was to toss it in the trash mid-way through.

(2) Sorry, girls, I suck dick., does the word dick mean the same thing?","output":"To determine if the word \\"dick\\" means the same thing in both sentences, let's analyze the context and usage in each sentence. Step 1: Analyze the context of sentence 1 and find the meaning of \\"dick.\\" \\"He wore a condom over his dick.\\" In this sentence, \\"dick\\" refers to the male genitalia, specifically the penis. The context makes it clear that \\"dick\\" is being used as a slang term for a physical part of the male body. Step 2: Analyze the context of sentence 2 and find the meaning of \\"dick.\\" \\"Sorry, girls, I suck dick.\\" In this sentence, \\"dick\\" is also used as a slang term for the male genitalia, specifically the penis. Here, it is used in the context of performing oral sex on a male partner. Step 3: Compare meanings and determine if they are the same. In both sentences, \\"dick\\" is used as a slang term for the male genitalia, specifically the penis. The context of both sentences is related to sexual activity, and in both cases, the word \\"dick\\" serves the same purpose, which is to reference the male genitalia. Conclusion: Yes, in both sentences (1) \\"He wore a condom over his dick.\\" and (2) \\"Sorry, girls, I suck dick.\\", the word \\"dick\\" means the same thing, referring to the male genitalia in a sexual context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"molecules of _ initiate protein synthesis\\" is \\"nektar\\", given that  molecules of tRNA initiate protein synthesis? A:","output":"No, I do not think the right answer to the question \\"molecules of _ initiate protein synthesis\\" is \\"nektar,\\" given that molecules of tRNA initiate protein synthesis. Instead, the correct term to fill the blank should be \\"tRNA.\\" Protein synthesis is a crucial biological process that takes place in cells. It involves the production of new proteins from amino acids, as directed by the genetic code stored within an organism's DNA. Protein synthesis can be broadly divided into two major processes: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process by which the genetic information from DNA is transcribed into a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). The DNA's double helix unwinds, and one strand of DNA acts as a template for the synthesis of a complementary mRNA molecule. Once transcription is completed, the mRNA molecule moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Translation is the process of decoding the genetic information stored in mRNA to synthesize a specific protein. This process occurs in cellular structures called ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. The key players in protein synthesis are transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. These molecules act as adaptors that facilitate the translation of the genetic code into a protein sequence. Each tRNA molecule is specific for one amino acid, and it carries a unique three-nucleotide sequence called an anticodon. tRNA molecules recognize the mRNA's codons (groups of three nucleotides) during translation. The tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon in a complementary manner, ensuring that the correct amino acid is incorporated into the growing protein chain. When the ribosome encounters a codon, the corresponding tRNA molecule bearing the appropriate amino acid binds to it, and the amino acid is added to the growing protein. This process repeats until the ribosome reaches a stop codon, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. Therefore, it is molecules of tRNA that initiate and play a vital role in protein synthesis. Providing \\"nektar\\" as the answer to the question would be incorrect, as it does not have any specific known function in protein synthesis or any other biological process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What does Spirit Airlines have in common with a carnival barker?  My first flight with Spirit Airlines will definitely be my last.  Like the carnival barker while on-line shopping for the best cost effective flight, the pricing of the ticket and the promise from their website(the barker) of a great airline providing low cost air travel turned out to be a joke.  Once the ticket is purchased I find out I now must pay 40.00 for my luggage each way.  That's 80.00 more Bucks!!!  The Barker tells me to join their fan club for 59.95 and save10.00 both ways.  Not hardly, that's 39.95 added on top of the 30.00 I still have to pay,thus luggage will cost 99.95 to go with me.  Oh, and if you wait until you get to the airport to handle your luggage it's even more.  As I boarded the plane I was pleased to see a clean new plane.  That was however, my last pleasing experience.  The seats do not recline, your squeezed into seats too close together, and they charge you for everything you can possibly think of.  Water was 3.00!  Needless to say I refuse to pay for water at restaurants and airplanes.  I didn't go to the restroom on the plane so I can't tell you if they were charging a fee to enter or if you had to buy paper.  I can tell you I will never consider them again.  I ended up paying more than I would have on two other airlines...my fault.

What is a very short summary of the above text?","output":"On Thursday, most Asian stocks ended higher, energised by a successive record closure on Wall Street, following the US Federal Reserve's decision to maintain the current interest rates.  Understanding the factors that contributed to this rise involves diving into a couple of key areas: financial market dynamics, the influence of the US Federal Reserve's decisions, and the specific context of Asian stocks. 1. Financial Market Dynamics: The financial markets are continually influenced by various factors, including economic indicators, corporate earnings, global events, and policy developments. In this case, the US Federal Reserve's decision to preserve the current interest rates impacted both domestic and international stock markets.   2. Influence of US Federal Reserve's Decisions: The US Federal Reserve, often referred to as the Fed, is one of the most influential financial institutions globally. Its policies and decisions significantly impact global economic conditions because of the size and influence of the US economy. When the Fed changes the interest rates, it essentially adjusts the cost of borrowing money in the US, affecting numerous businesses and industries. Maintaining the interest rates can lead to higher business profits, as companies can borrow money without worrying about increased costs, encouraging investors and boosting the stock markets. 3. Context of Asian Stocks: The performance of Asian stocks is often associated with the economic conditions in the Asia Pacific region, but it is also influenced by the economic stability of powerful nations like the US. Wall Street is a significant indicator of the US economy's performance, so a record closure on Wall Street implies a strong US economy and confident investors. This positivity tends to spill over into global markets, in this case, positively impacting closing levels of the mostly Asian stocks. Therefore, buoyed by Wall Street’s record closing and the US Federal Reserve's decision not to increase interest rates, Asian stocks found welcoming ground for growth and stability, closing mostly higher on Thursday. These improved closing levels reflect the combined positive effect of decisions made across the globe and the delicate interdependencies that exist within our interconnected financial markets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors. The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET). Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams. Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests. Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.
