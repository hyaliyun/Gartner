Please answer the following question: Information:  - Greek literature refers to writings composed in areas of Greek influence throughout the period in which the Greek-speaking people have existed.  - The Theban Cycle is a collection of four lost epics of ancient Greek literature which related the mythical history of the Boeotian city of Thebes. They were composed in dactylic hexameter verse and were probably written down between 750 and 500 BC.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - In Greek mythology, Polynices, sometimes spelled Polyneices, (Greek: , transl. \\"Polyneíkes\\", \\"manifold strife\\") was the son of Oedipus and Jocasta. His wife was Argea. His father, Oedipus, was discovered to have killed his father and married his mother, and was expelled from Thebes, leaving his sons Eteocles and Polynices to rule. Because of a curse put on them by their father Oedipus, the sons Polynices and Eteocles did not share the rule peacefully and died as a result by killing each other in a battle for the control of Thebes.  - In Greek mythology, Eteocles was a king of Thebes, the son of Oedipus and either Jocasta or Euryganeia. The name is from earlier \\"*Etewoklewes\\", meaning \\"truly glorious\\". \\"Tawagalawas\\" is thought to be the Hittite rendition of the name. Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother without knowing his relationship to either. When the relationship was revealed, he was expelled from Thebes. The rule passed to his sons Eteocles and Polynices. However, because of a curse from their father, the two brothers did not share the rule peacefully. Eteocles was succeeded by his uncle, Creon.  - Dactylic hexameter (also known as \\"heroic hexameter\\" and \\"the meter of epic\\") is a form of meter or rhythmic scheme in poetry. It is traditionally associated with the quantitative meter of classical epic poetry in both Greek and Latin and was consequently considered to be \\"the\\" Grand Style of classical poetry. The premier examples of its use are Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\", Virgil's \\"Aeneid\\", and Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\".  - Epigoni ( Greek :  , Epigonoi , \`\` Progeny '' ) was an early Greek epic , a sequel to the Thebaid and therefore grouped in the Theban cycle . Some ancient authors seem to have considered it a part of the Thebaid and not a separate poem . According to one source the epic extended to 7,000 lines of verse . It told the story of the last battle for Thebes by the Epigoni , the children of the heroes who had previously fought for the city . Only the first line is now known : Now , Muses , let us begin to sing of younger men ... Additional references , without verbal quotations , suggest that the myth of the death of Procris and the story of Teiresias 's daughter Manto formed part of the Epigoni . The epic was sometimes ascribed to Homer , but Herodotus doubted this attribution . According to the Scholia on Aristophanes there was an alternative attribution to \`\` Antimachus '' . This presumably means Antimachus of Teos , and for this reason another verse line attributed without title to Antimachus of Teos is conjecturally thought to belong to the Epigoni . An alternative explanation for the naming of Antimachus here would be that the later epic poet Antimachus of Colophon had been accused of stealing the traditional Epigoni by incorporating its plot in his literary epic Thebais . The story of the Epigoni was afterwards told again in the form of a tragedy by Sophocles , Epigoni .  - In Greek mythology, Epigoni (from , meaning \\"offspring\\") are the sons of the Argive heroes who had fought and been killed in the first Theban war, the subject of the \\"Thebaid\\", in which Polynices and six allies (the Seven Against Thebes) attacked Thebes because Polynices' brother, Eteocles, refused to give up the throne as promised. The second Theban war, also called the war of the Epigoni, occurred ten years later, when the Epigoni, wishing to avenge the death of their fathers, attacked Thebes.    What entity does 'epigoni ' has the relation 'original language of work' with? Answer:","output":"Epigoni has the relation 'original language of work' with Ancient Greek. This is because Epigoni was an early Greek epic, part of the Theban Cycle and is known to be written in dactylic hexameter verse, which was the traditional poetic form in ancient Greek literature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday.

Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Sesame Street Fever is a concept album made by the cast of Sesame Street in 1978 .

Look for programs or scholarships from outside sources that can help with the remaining cost. Apply for as many of these scholarships as you can to reduce the cost of your education as much as possible. Once you are in college, maintain the academic standing required of your scholarship. Most grants or scholarships require that you maintain a certain GPA or otherwise remain in good academic standing. Continue to work hard and get grades high enough to keep your scholarship for as long as you need it. Athletic scholarships are highly competitive, and they only go to the best players in a region or state. If you're not the best player on your team and in your region, getting an athletic scholarship will be difficult. Practice and work hard to improve in your sport. Contact coaches at colleges you're interested in.  The best athletic schools might overlook mediocre academics, but if a scholarship comes down to you and a similar player with better grades, chances are it'll go to the other person. Because of this, keep your grades up, too. Being proactive about getting recruited will put you on the coach's radar as an athlete. Since you came to them, they'll know you're interested in their school and will be more likely to consider you. While this scholarship can help you get a top-tier education for free, it comes with a cost. You'll have to spend upwards of 20 hours a week practicing your sport, which can keep you from investing in the academics of college. These scholarships are also re-awarded each year, so they can be taken away if your coach doesn't feel you need or deserve it each year.  Consider lower-division schools, too. While you may dream of playing for your favorite Division I school, these scholarships are much more difficult to get. The ROTC also offers scholarships if you're looking into joining the military. For most ROTC programs, you will serve four years of active service and four years with the Individual Ready Reserve, during which you can be called back to active duty. For certain positions, this commitment may be longer or shorter. For instance, pilots usually commit to 10 years of service. ROTC programs operate in over 1000 colleges and universities in the country. Decide on, apply to, and gain acceptance to one of these schools. If necessary, specify that you're applying as an ROTC student. You can then apply for the scholarships from there.  Make sure you fulfill the basic requirements for an ROTC scholarship. For high school students, you must be a US citizen between 17 and 26 years old, have a GPA of at least 2.50, have a high school diploma or GED, score a minimum of 920 on the combined math and verbal SAT or 19 on the ACT (excluding the writing portion), and meet certain physical requirements.  In order to keep your scholarship, you must maintain certain physical and academic standards throughout your college career. Make sure you stay physically fit, and keep your GPA above the required minimum (2.50 or 3, depending on your branch of ROTC). Scholarships can be taken away if you fail to meet the necessary requirements, so be aware of your standing within your program. After college, fulfill your service commitment. ROTC gives you a free college education, so be sure to honor your commitment to service in the armed forces. Do you have an unusual hobby? Are you from a minority or military background? Are you a first-generation college student? What are your talents and interests? Write down everything you can think of, and make a note of anything that might help you land a scholarship. There are tons out there that you may qualify for.  Use reputable websites like CollegeScholarships.org, FastWeb, or  Scholarships.com to search through many available scholarships. Research everything you can think of to find scholarships that you might qualify for, or look through a list of scholarships for those that fit your background and interests. If applicable, put together a portfolio, promotion video, or other material to display your skills. Scholarships in the arts generally require proof of the quality of your work. For writing, photography, or art, put together a portfolio to display the quality and diversity of your work. For dance, music, or other talents, make audio or video recordings of your best performances. These don't need to be fancy, but they should show off your talent as well as possible.

Over the course of Carrie's engagement, Monica became increasingly involved with the wedding planning process, offering her opinions and insights on everything from invitations to catering options. She saw firsthand just how much time and effort went into organizing such an elaborate event. Although Monica had an established career and a loving family, she couldn't help but wonder when it would be her turn to walk down the aisle and say \\"I do.\\" The months leading up to Carrie's wedding were a whirlwind of emotions for both women. Carrie, with all of the planning and anticipation, experienced the highs and lows typically associated with wedding preparation. But Monica's feelings of excitement often gave way to envy and a subtle sadness, as she remembered her own single status. Monica's friends and family tried to reassure her that her time would come, encouraging her to focus on the love she did have in her life rather than the love she longed for. As the big day approached, Monica found herself playing a significant role in the wedding's success. She was tasked with making sure everything ran smoothly, from managing the bridesmaids to overseeing the setup of the ceremony and reception. This proved to be both a blessing and a curse, as Monica was able to put her expertise to use and ensure that her friend's special day was truly unforgettable. However, it also served as a constant reminder that she was still waiting for her own love story to unfold. On the day of Carrie's wedding, Monica put aside her personal feelings and focused on supporting her friend. It was a beautiful, romantic event that seemed to encapsulate everything that a wedding should be. Carrie was radiant in her elegant bridal gown as she exchanged vows with her soulmate, Tyler, surrounded by their friends and family. As they said their \\"I do's,\\" Monica couldn't help but feel her heart swell with pride, knowing that she had played a part in making this day happen. After the ceremony, the festivities began in earnest. During the heartfelt speeches, the tearful first dance, and the boisterous laughter that rang out throughout the reception, Monica felt a sense of contentment that she hadn't experienced in a while. Regardless of her own yearnings, she knew that this day was about celebrating the love between Carrie and Tyler, and she truly couldn't be happier for them. As the night wore on, Monica began talking to one of the groomsmen, Alex. They had a lot in common and struck up an easy rapport. It wasn't long before they shared a dance, and then another. Monica felt an undeniable connection, and as they parted ways at the end of the evening, they exchanged numbers and promised to keep in touch. Monica couldn't have known it at the time, but this fateful encounter would lead to her own love story unfolding. Over the coming months, Alex and Monica grew closer and closer. They connected on a deeper level and it soon became apparent that they were destined for each other. A few years later, Monica found herself walking down the aisle towards Alex, finally experiencing the fairytale wedding she'd always dreamed of. Carrie and Monica's experiences served as a testament to the journey that love can take. From the excitement and challenges of wedding planning to the unwavering support of a best friend, their story reflects the power of patience and the understanding that love can often be found when we least expect it.

Please add spaces between words: CanIalsodevelopnegativesandtraditionalslides?","output":"Yes, you can also develop negatives and traditional slides. Both of these photographic processes involve working with photographic film, and each has its own unique steps for development. To assist you in understanding the processes, let's examine each type separately and outline the steps involved in developing both negatives and traditional slides. 1. Developing Negatives: Negatives are created by exposing a roll of film to light, which reacts with the emulsion to create a latent image. This latent image is then developed into a visible image through the following steps: a) Loading the film: First, you must carefully load your roll of film into a developing tank in a darkroom or using a changing bag to avoid exposure to light, which could damage the film. b) Developing the film: Mix the necessary chemicals, typically a developer and a stop bath, in their respective containers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pour the developer into the tank and agitate the film for the required amount of time. This step allows the images to become visible on the film by converting the exposed silver halide crystals into metallic silver. c) Stop bath: Drain the developer from the tank and pour in the stop bath to halt the development process. Agitate the film for the recommended amount of time to ensure even coverage of the stop bath. d) Fixing the film: After draining the stop bath, pour in the fixer solution. This step removes any remaining unexposed silver halide crystals, making the negative image permanent and preventing further reaction to light. e) Washing the film: Thoroughly rinse the film with water to remove residual chemicals. This step helps preserve the image quality and extends the life of the negatives. f) Drying the film: After washing, carefully remove the film from the tank and hang it to dry in a dust-free environment. Once the film is completely dry, you can cut it into individual frames and store it in sleeves or contact sheets. 2. Developing Traditional Slides: Slide film, also known as reversal or positive film, produces a positive image when developed, as opposed to a negative. The process for developing slide films entails the following steps: a) Loading the film: Just like with negatives, load the slide film into a developing tank in a darkroom or using a changing bag. b) First developer: Mix the first developer solution and pour it into the tank. Agitate the film for the recommended amount of time, during which the exposed silver halide crystals are converted to metallic silver, forming a negative image. c) Reversal bath: The reversal step involves pouring a reversal bath into the developing tank, which prepares the film for the second development process. The reversal bath contains a chemical that re-exposes the entire film, allowing the unexposed silver halide crystals remaining in the original negative to then participate in the second development. d) Color developer: This step converts the remaining silver halide crystals to dyes, creating a positive image. Drain the reversal bath and add the color developer to the tank, agitating it for the specified duration. e) Bleaching and fixing: Pour the bleach-fixing solution into the tank to remove metallic silver, leaving only the dyes in the film. This is akin to the fixing step in negative development, as it makes the image permanent. f) Washing and drying: Rinse the film thoroughly to remove residual chemicals, then hang it to dry in a dust-free environment. Once dry, cut the film into individual frames and mount them into slide mounts for projection or storage. In conclusion, developing both negatives and traditional slides involves a series of steps using various chemical solutions to create and preserve the images. With the right equipment, practice, and patience, you can successfully develop your own negatives and slides, providing you with a hands-on experience of the analog photography process."},{"instruction":"Question: This article: The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed?, what is it ?

The Rec is pretty much the only thing in town for the children, as the Homeowners Association totally forgot about the fact that nearly 25% of the population of New Grenada is under the age of 15. So, naturally, the kids find themselves some other ways to have fun; sex, drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and rock n roll. One of the first scenes shown is Mark Perry (Vincent Spano), and his friend shooting his B.B. gun at oncoming cars on the overpass. However, when they hit a police cruiser, they laugh and cheer, and decide to leave before the cop sees them. They hop on their bikes, and ride down the road, passing Carl and Ritchie, who, when warned by the boys about cops, dive into the weeds behind an electric control box. The police car pulls up, and out steps Sgt. Doberman (Harry Northup), the most hated cop in town. He sees the boys, and, upon frisking them, finds a three-inch pocketknife on Ritchie.

Summarize this article: Choppers, trucks douse stricken nuke plant      By Hayden Cooper, staff      Updated      Japan is making a last-ditch attempt to cool stricken reactors at its Fukushima nuclear plant, but efforts so far appear to have had little effect.      Special military fire trucks unleashed jets of water on a damaged reactor at the quake-hit plant on Thursday, after police were earlier forced to withdraw their own water cannon from the scene due to high levels of radiation.      While police must be outside to use their vehicle, the military vehicles are built to allow personnel to remain inside.      As well as water-spraying trucks, four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters from the Japan Self-Defence Forces flew water bombing missions over the plant, emptying tonnes of water onto reactors which have been overheating since being damaged by last Friday's earthquake and tsunami.      But there are serious doubts the water drops will have any major effect, with the amount of water each chopper drops a fraction of what is needed to fill the pool.      The focus of the missions appeared to be the No.3 reactor but there have been reports that only two out of the four water drops actually hit their mark, and the missions appeared to have little impact on the radiation levels.      Part of the reason why the water drops have not been that accurate is that they were not allowed to fly too low because of the radiation levels.      Defence minister Toshimi Kitazawa said an additional 11 military vehicles would be deployed for efforts to help cool the reactors, while pumps supplied by the US armed forces were also being transferred.      On Friday, water drops will start above the No.2 reactor, which has been letting off white smoke or steam.      Tokyo has denied claims that the spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor are totally exposed, with cabinet spokesman Yukio Edano saying there is still water inside.      The plant's operators are desperately trying to restore electricity supply so the cooling system can restart.      \\"We cannot tell when, but we want to restore the power source as soon as possible,\\" a spokesman for the plant's operators TEPCO told AFP.      Japan's foreign ministry spokesman Hidenobu Sobashima says the government is making every possible effort to contain the damage.      \\"We are not in a position to comment on whether the concern is unwarranted, but we understand the concern,\\" he said.      \\"The government is giving the advice which the government considers appropriate. We hope the international community monitors the situation in a calm manner, as the prime minister appealed to the residents and the people of Japan, to act calmly.\\"      As the fight for control of the reactors continued, Japan instructed local authorities to start screening food for radioactivity.      Australians have been told to leave the capital and other areas affected by the ongoing crisis.      The Department of Foreign Affairs has now widened its recommended exclusion zone for Australians around the Fukushima plant to 80 kilometres.      Japanese authorities had ordered people within 30 kilometres of the plant to evacuate or stay indoors.      This afternoon the Federal Government said the number of Australians unaccounted for in Japan had fallen to 20.      Call for volunteers      The Japanese government's nuclear safety agency has said the top priority should be pouring water into the fuel-rod pools at reactors three and four, which may be boiling and are not fully covered by roofs that would reduce radiation leaks.      Employees of TEPCO and other industry firms have volunteered to join efforts to control the escalating crisis, local media said.      TEPCO put out a call for about 20 volunteers to join the battle to bring the situation under control at the Fukushima No.1 plant, where last week's quake and tsunami knocked out the reactor cooling systems, Jiji Press reported.      Offers came in from TEPCO employees and others, including a 59-year-old man with four decades of experience working at nuclear power stations for a regional power company who was due to retire in six months, the report said.      Officials at TEPCO were not immediately available to confirm the reports.      TEPCO was preparing to restore outside power lines from Tohoku Electric Power Co., which serves the region, and connect its damaged electric transmission system with unaffected lines.      \\"At the moment, we are concentrating our efforts on this work,\\" he said.      \\"If the restoration work is completed, we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel.\\"      The 9.0-magnitude quake, the biggest on record to strike Japan, knocked down electricity pylons which Tohoku had used to supply power to the TEPCO plant.      Some 70 workers have been using pumps to pour seawater to cool reactors at the plant, according to media reports, using electricity from borrowed mobile generators.      -ABC/wires      First posted ||||| Nuclear safety officials in France said they were \\"pessimistic\\" about whether engineers could prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima power plant after a pool containing spent fuel rods overheated and boiled dry.      Last night radiation levels were \\"extremely high\\" in the stricken building, which was breached by an earlier explosion, meaning that radiation could now escape into the atmosphere.      Tokyo Electric, the owners of the plant, said five workers had been killed at the site, two were missing and 21 had been injured.      Last night, a US nuclear safety chief said the Japanese government had failed to acknowledge the full seriousness of the situation at the Fukushima plant and that warnings to citizens had been insufficient and understated.      Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, warned that if \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels increased it would become impossible for workers to continue to take corrective measures at the plant as \\"the doses they could experience would potentially be lethal doses in a very short period of time\\".      As Japan resorted to increasingly desperate measures – including dumping water on the site from helicopters – there were accusations that the situation was now \\"out of control\\".      The Foreign Office responded to the latest developments by advising all British citizens to leave Tokyo – which is 140 miles south of the plant – and the whole of northern Japan. The EU has even urged member states to check Japanese food imports for radioactivity.      Emperor Akihito made a rare address to the nation, urging the Japanese to pull together, but hinted at his own fears for the nuclear crisis saying: \\"I hope things will not get worse.\\" In London, the FTSE–100 share index slumped as news of the latest emergency emerged, closing 1.7 per cent down.      The official death toll from last Friday's earthquake and tsunami stood at 4,314 last night, with another 8,606 listed as missing.      Thousands of people still waiting for food aid in the most remote areas of the disaster zone endured fresh misery yesterday as heavy snow began to fall across northern Japan. But all eyes were on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant as Japanese authorities admitted concerns over rising temperatures in three pools containing spent fuel rods.      A failure of the cooling system that has crippled the entire plant led to water boiling in the No4 pool. Last night the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) said there was no water left in the pool, resulting in \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels. An earlier fire and explosion in the No 4 reactor building is thought to have breached the protective walls around the pool. A statement from the USNRC said: \\"We believe that secondary containment has been destroyed and there is no water in the spent fuel pool and we believe that radiation levels are extremely high which could possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures.\\"      If the water has gone, Mr Jaczko warned, there is nothing to stop the fuel rods from getting hotter and ultimately melting down. The outer shell of the rods could also ignite with enough force to propel the radioactive fuel inside over a wide area.      Jeremy Browne, the Foreign Office minister, said: \\"There is clearly an evolving situation and things are clearly getting worse at the Fukushima nuclear plant.\\"      Attempts to cool the site by dumping sea water from helicopters had to be aborted at one stage because of dangerous radiation levels in the air above the plant. A police water cannon was brought in to help blast water into the overheating reactors and pools, but there were warnings that it may be too late to prevent a disaster. Thierry Charles, a safety official at France's Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), said: \\"The next 48 hours will be decisive. I am pessimistic because, since Sunday, I have seen that almost none of the solutions has worked.\\" He described the situation as \\"a major risk\\", but added: \\"All is not lost.\\"      Asked about the maximum possible amount of radioactive release, he said \\"it would be in the same range as Chernobyl\\".      The incident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine on April 26 1986 is estimated to have caused 57 direct deaths, with some 4,000 additional deaths from cancer.      Francois Baroin, a French government spokesman, went further, saying: \\"In the worst of cases, it could have an impact worse than Chernobyl.\\" He added: \\"They have visibly lost the essential of control.\\"      Malcolm Grimston, a British nuclear expert at the Chatham House think tank, played down suggestions of an impending disaster, saying Fukushima was not like Chernobyl.      \\"We're nearly five days after the fission process was stopped, the levels of radioactive iodine will only be about two–thirds of where they were at the start, some of the other, very short–lived, very radioactive material will be gone altogether by now,\\" he said.      Earlier, Nathalie Kosciusko–Morizet, France's ecology minister, had said that \\"the worst scenario is possible and even probable\\". At one point, radiation levels at the plant rose to such dangerous levels that all workers were evacuated from the site. A 180–strong team was later allowed back to continue attempts to cool the fuel rods, but the government raised the maximum allowable radiation exposure for workers from 100 millisieverts per year to 250, which it said was \\"unavoidable due to the circumstances\\".      Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency's director general, said the situation was \\"very serious\\". He is flying to Japan today for a first–hand briefing on the crisis. ||||| U.S. officials are alarmed at how the Japanese are handling the escalating nuclear reactor crisis and fear that if they do not get control of the plants within the next 24 to 48 hours they could have a situation that will be \\"deadly for decades.\\"      \\"It would be hard to describe how alarming this is right now,\\" one U.S. official told ABC News.      President Obama has been briefed by nuclear experts.      The Japanese have evacuated most of the reactor personnel from the Fukushima nuclear complex and are rotating teams of 50 workers through the facility in an attempt to cool it down.      \\"We are all-out urging the Japanese to get more people back in there to do emergency operation there, that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical,\\" the official said. \\"Urgent efforts are needed on the part of the Japanese to restore emergency operations to cool\\" down the reactors' rods before they trigger a meltdown.      \\"They need to stop pulling out people—and step up with getting them back in the reactor to cool it. There is a recognition this is a suicide mission,\\" the official said.      The official said the United States is in very deep consultations with Japanese about the way forward and that the only thing that has been favorable is the wind pattern that is blowing the contaminated material out to sea instead south towards Tokyo and other populated areas, but that can't be counted upon.      The U.S. official says experts believe there is a rupture in two, maybe three of the six reactors at the Fukushima power plant, but as worrisome is the fact that spent fuel rods are now exposed to the air, which means that substances like cesium, which have a long half-life, could become airborne.      \\"That could be deadly for decades,\\" the official said.      There is a growing concern around the world that a nuclear catastrophic disaster is in the works.      \\"There is talk of an apocalypse and I think the word is particularly well chosen,\\" European Union's energy commissioner Günther Oettinger said today, according to various reports. \\"Practically everything is out of control. I cannot exclude the worst in the hours and days to come.\\"      The United States has instituted a 50-mile evacuation zone for U.S. forces and American citizens from the Fukushima power plant, four times the size of Japan's 12-mile evacuation zone. Only exceptions that are made are for relief missions.      \\"Recently the NRC made a recommendation that based on the available information that we have, that for a comparable situation in the United States, we would recommend an evacuation to a much larger radius than has currently been provided in Japan,\\" Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Greg Jaczko said at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee.      Jaczko said of the four plants that are endangered at the Fukushima site, there has been a hydrogen explosion at one unit and secondary containment has been destroyed.      \\"We believe radiation levels are extremely high, which could possibly impact ability to take corrective measures,\\" he said.      U.S. analysis show that some of the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant has drifted northward and out to sea, officials say, but the country is hardly clear of danger.      U.S. Fears Japan's Crisis Could Be Worse Than Chernobyl      Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Narita Airport today amid rising concerns of a radioactive fallout.      The head of the U.S. Department of Energy said today that the nuclear disaster unfolding in Japan could be worse than the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania that dampened Americans' view of nuclear power plants for decades to come.      \\"Events unfolding in the Japan incidents appear to be more serious than Three Mile Island. To what extent, we don't know that. They are unfolding hour by hour,\\" Energy Secretary Steven Chu said earlier today at the hearing.      Chu's assessment is in line with views expressed by many experts, some of whom even believe the Japan crisis could be worse than the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine that left hundreds sick and killed several from radiation.      The United States has deployed thousands of military and civilian staff to assist the Japanese in dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake and the resulting tsunami, which has killed thousands.      To date there have been 113 helicopter missions and 125 fixed wing missions. More than 129,000 pounds of water and 4,200 pounds of food have been delivered .      The Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sent teams of U.S. experts to assess the nuclear situation.      U.S. aid to Japan has reached nearly 5.9 million, with total planned assistance amounting to 8 million. USAID says the primary humanitarian needs on the ground remain food, safe drinking water, blankets, medical supplies, fuel, and sanitation infrastructure.      ABC News' Huma Khan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report. ||||| Japan's nuclear crisis now hangs largely on whether it can get control over the radioactive waste held in pools of water at the troubled Fukushima Daiichi power plant.      Workers have struggled to cool the used nuclear-fuel rods held in these pools, in an urgent fight to prevent a release of significant quantities of radiation into the environment.      On Thursday morning, helicopters from the Self Defense Forces, Japan's version of the military, began dumping water over the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex, according to government broadcaster NHK.      Spent Fuel at Risk View Interactive All through the Fukushima plant, efforts are focused on keeping cool water over nuclear fuel rods in reactor cores and in pools where spent fuel is stored. More photos and interactive graphics      On Wednesday, Scott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said, \\"We now understand that conditions for the spent fuel pool in Reactor 4 are very serious.\\" He added that \\"our understanding is the conditions have deteriorated.\\"      The waste—used fuel rods from the six reactors—continues to be highly radioactive even when it is no longer useful for generating electricity and is removed from the reactor core.      To prevent the used fuel rods from heating up, sustaining damage, and then releasing radiation, they must be continually cooled by water for many years.      The Fukushima complex has seven pools serving six reactors. On Wednesday, officials acknowledged they faced serious cooling problems with at least four of the pools.      So far, at least two pools have lost enough water to expose fuel rods to the air, allowing them to overheat and release hydrogen gas. The gas is a product of the breakdown of zirconium cladding that encases fuel rods.      Nuclear physicist James Acton and WSJ's Lee Hotz discuss whether Japan can avoid nuclear disaster as workers scramble to cool the overheating spent fuel at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant.      The rods, known as spent fuel, are stored on an upper floor adjacent to, and at the same height as, the reactor. That keeps the distance the fuel rods must be moved to a minimum and was supposed to protect them from tsunamis.      However—unlike the reactor core, which is surrounded by a strong steel vessel—the only shielding between the radioactive waste and the outside air is concrete.      Increased heating and consequent damage to the fuel rods could mean \\"that there's a clear pathway for the release of radionuclides,\\" or radioactive materials, said Edward Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.      As the water in the pool heats up and evaporates, the vapor carries some radioactive elements, including tritium gas. Worse, if the water level drops and exposes the spent fuel, those rods can suffer the same type of damage—a partial or full meltdown—that can occur to a reactor core.      \\"If the temperature continues to increase, you reach a point where the fuel pellets can melt,\\" Dr. Lyman said. As a result, \\"a lot of fission products will start to bubble out.\\"      Smoke rising from the plant's No. 3 reactor indicates that a pool where spent fuel rods are stored within the building had dried out, a spokesman for utility operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. The water from the helicopters was aimed at this pool.      Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes there could be a crack in the spent fuel pool, increasing the risk that water drains from the pool and leads to overheating.      The pool at unit 4 is especially worrying.      Its fuel rods were removed from the reactor core in December 2010, and therefore contain a high level of radioactivity and are generating more heat than used fuel rods stored elsewhere at the Fukushima site.

Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com and Gautam Naik at gautam.naik@wsj.com ||||| Summary:","output":"Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has faced an array of serious cooling issues with its stricken reactors following damage from an earthquake and tsunami. Military fire trucks and helicopters have attempted to unleash jets of water onto the damaged reactor to cool it down, but there have been concerns about the limited effectiveness of the water drops. Part of the reason for this inefficiency is that helicopters were unable to fly at a low altitude due to high radiation levels. Additionally, restoring electricity supply to the cooling system remains a crucial task. Officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) have called for volunteers to help control the escalating crisis, and efforts have been made to restore outside power lines and connect the damaged electric transmission system with unaffected lines. As part of their safety measures, Japan has instructed local authorities to begin screening food for radioactivity and extended the exclusion zone around the Fukushima plant to 80 km."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest, Ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, \\"this is a show\\". True, it's not as bad as it's previous show, \\"Flavor of Love\\" - but it's just as bad. It reminds me of a skit from the 90's show \\"In Living Color\\" where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on \\"The Love Connection\\" dating show and he picked \\"Robin Givens\\" for a date. Mike talked of how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in. This show reminds me of that. The men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - (I would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV.) but these are professional reality actors, so why bother.

Write a summary based on this article: Four people, including three hostages and a gunman, were found dead inside of a Napa County veterans home Friday night after an 8-hour standoff, officials said.      Law enforcement entered a room in the Veterans Home of California in Yountville in the evening and found the bodies of three women and the gunman.      Advertisement      The three women worked with the nonprofit organization Pathway Home treatment program, which is housed on the Veterans Home campus, near Highway 29. The victims were identified as Executive Director Christine Loeber, 48; Clinical Director Dr. Jen Golick, 42; and Clinical Psychologist Dr. Jennifer Gonzales, 29, by the Napa County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office.      Courtesy photos Christine Loeber (left) and Dr. Jennifer Gonzales (right)      \\"These Brave Women were accomplished professionals who dedicated their careers to serving our nation’s veterans,\\" Pathway Home said in a statement. \\"All of us at The Pathway Home are devastated by today’s events. We stand with the families, friends, and colleagues who share in this terrible loss.\\"      “The hearts of the highway patrol family go out to those families that are grieving,” CHP Assistant Chief Chris Childs said. “I think I can speak on behalf of all law enforcement (Friday night), we express our deepest and most sincere condolences to the families.”      The suspect was identified as 36-year-old Albert Wong of Sacramento, the sheriff's office said. He used to be with the Pathway Home program, and records show he was a former Army infantryman.      The situation began around 10:20 a.m. when shots were fired during an employee going-away party in the Pathway House building, where combat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan receive treatment, Childs said.      Wong fired multiple shots with a rifle in the dining room and took several hostages into one room initially before releasing all but three hostages, Napa County Sheriff John Robertson said. It's unclear of the three hostages were targeted or selected at random.      An arriving deputy exchanged gunfire with Wong, forcing him back into the facility and into the one room. Childs said that also eliminated his ability to take more hostages.      The deputy was not injured in the gun battle.      Law enforcement tactical teams then surrounded the one room where Wong held the hostages during the standoff, Childs said.      Hostage negotiation teams were called in, and officers tried to contact Wong by calling his personal cellphone as well as phones inside the dorm, Robertson said. However, they were not able to talk to Wong during the standoff.      Officers also found Wong's car, which was a rental, parked near the building. Bomb-sniffing dogs and the CHP's explosives unit responded to the scene to check out the car and deemed it safe. Law enforcement then discovered Wong's cellphone inside the car.      Around 6 p.m., officers found the bodies of the gunman and hostages.      The investigation is ongoing, officials said.      “This is still an active crime scene, as you can imagine,” Childs said. “There's a lot of work to be done.”      Robertson said law enforcement would be at the scene for hours, if not days.      Officials will be repopulating the veterans home Friday night. The California Veterans Affairs Department said this is the largest home for veterans in the United States, with about 1,000 residents.      There is no threat to public safety at this time, Childs said.      WITNESS DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED      A man said a gunman quietly came into the party and staff meeting at the Northern California veterans home and let some leave while keeping others hostage.      Larry Kamer said his wife, Devereaux Smith, is a fundraiser for the nonprofit Pathway Home. She was at the party Friday morning of 10 to 15 people in the program's building.      He said his wife was inside the home's dining hall and was not allowed to leave during the standoff. He spoke to her by phone.      Kamer said he does not know why the shooter let his wife and some colleagues leave but kept the three hostages.      RESIDENT DESCRIBES LOCKDOWN AT HOME      Police evacuated the property and closed off nearby roads during the standoff. An armored police vehicle, ambulances and several fire trucks were at the facility.      Army veteran and resident Bob Sloan, 73, was working at the home's TV station when a co-worker came in and said he had just heard four gunshots coming from the Pathway House.      Sloan sent alerts for residents to stay put. He said he sent out a red banner on in-house TV that read, \\"Emergency notice. This is an active situation, ongoing.\\"      The retired police officer said residents were worried about the length of the standoff.      \\"People are starting to get concerned because it's been going on for so long,\\" he said.      Except for helicopters buzzing overhead, the home was eerily quiet, Sloan said. He described seeing police with \\"long-barrel assault-type weapons\\" crouching around the building, some taking cover behind trees during the standoff.      ---      The Associated Press contributed to this story.

The High Court of Justice in Ireland  ruled on 31 July 1923 that a state of war no longer existed, and consequently the internment of republicans, permitted under common law only in wartime, was now illegal. Without a formal peace, holding 13,000 prisoners and worried that fighting could break out again at any time, the government enacted two Public Safety  Acts on 1 and 3 August 1923, to permit continued internment and other measures. Thousands of Anti-Treaty IRA members  were arrested by the Free State forces in the weeks and months after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home. On 27 August 1923, a general election was held, which Cumann na nGaedheal, the pro-Free State party, won with about 40% of the first-preference vote. The Republicans, represented by Sinn Féin, won about 27% of the vote. Many of their candidates and supporters were still imprisoned before, during and after the election. In October 1923, around 8,000 of the 12,000 Republican prisoners in Free State gaols went on a hunger strike. The strike lasted for 41 days and met little success . However, most of the women prisoners were released shortly thereafter and the hunger strike helped concentrate the Republican movement on the prisoners and their associated organisations.

The sleepy small Southern town of Clarksburg. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in peak nasty form) cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road. Childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver Michael McCord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by Martin Sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (Sheen's real-life sibling Joe Estevez in a brief cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, working from a taut and intriguing script by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 70's drive-in movie gems \\"Welcome Home, Soldier Boys\\" and \\"Macon County Line\\"), relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, neatly creates a flavorsome 50's period setting, and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between Childress and McCord. The uniformly fine cast helps a lot: Sheen radiates a brash James Deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead, Morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet diner waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin as a folksy deputy, Nick Nolte as amiable gas station attendant Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as sassy local tart Sissy, Britt Leach as stingy cab driver Johnny, and Frederic Downs as the stern Judge J.A. Hooker. The climactic vehicular confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle thrilling doozy. Terry K. Meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the groovy, syncopated score by Luchi De Jesus, and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-TV winner.

In gridiron football, the safety (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play that results in two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored in a number of ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can have a significant impact on the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick. is it possible to get 1 point in football?

A rouge can be scored when a team kicks the ball into the opposing team's end zone, and the opposing team cannot return the ball out of the end zone or if the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone after being kicked. In American football, a 1-point safety can occur during an extra point or two-point conversion attempt if the defending team forces the offensive team back into their own end zone, and the offensive team commits a safety.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How many different countries did Saint-Saëns visit?  For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry. The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter.

This is because ecological damage can lead to deforestation, pollution, and climate change, which negatively impact the growth and well-being of trees and plants.

Regarding the second effect mentioned, which involves the use of leaves, mud, and spider webs to glue the sticks together in bird nests, the supposed perturbation would have a noticeable effect. With fewer leaves available, birds might struggle to create sturdy nests using this method.

China says it has had \\"a frank, in-depth talk\\" with North Korea about the situation on the Korean Peninsula after Pyongyang's announcement of a planned satellite launch provoked an international outcry. Wu Dawei, China's special representative for the Korean Peninsula, met with Ri Yong Ho, a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator, in Beijing on Monday. Wu told the Chinese broadcaster CCTV that he and Ri had exchanged \\"opinions on the topic of preserving the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula,\\" as well as on Pyongyang's planned satellite launch. China appears to be putting pressure on North Korea over the plan to fire off a long-range rocket that the North says will carry the satellite into orbit. South Korea has called the announcement a \\"grave provocation\\" that contravenes U.N. Security Council resolutions. And the Japanese defense minister, Naoki Tanaka, said Monday that he would consider ordering the destruction of the projectile if it presented a risk to Japan. Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun expressed \\"concern\\" when he met North Korean ambassador Ji Jae Ryong on Friday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported over the weekend. \\"We sincerely hope parties concerned stay calm and exercise restraint and avoid escalation of tension that may lead to a more complicated situation,\\" Xinhua quoted Zhang as saying. China rarely puts public pressure on its northern neighbor, which relies on Beijing's political, economic and diplomatic support. North Korea announced Friday that it plans to launch a satellite into space next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder, Kim Il Sung, grandfather of Pyongyang's new leader Kim Jong-un. The United States says the rocket launch would be a \\"deal-breaker\\" for a recent aid agreement between the United States and North Korea. In closed-door meetings partly brokered by China, North Korea last month agreed to stop nuclear tests, uranium enrichment and long-range missile launches in exchange for resumption of U.S. food aid. The announced missile launch also could derail recent efforts to reconvene the multilateral talks, known as six-party talks, on denuclearizing North Korea. The launch is expected to take place April 12 to 16. North Korea says it plans to invite experts and the media to observe the launch.

What a miracle! How would it feel to lie back in water so thick with salt that it was impossible to sink?               Fed by the Jordan River and smaller streams, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on the earth's surface, and its water is ten times saltier than the Mediterranean. As evaporation  is its only outlet, salt and other minerals become super-concentrated. Earlier this year, I drove down the long, steep hill to realize my dream. The shoreline was a broad area of bare salt-mud, but the water edge was out of sight. It seemed as if somebody had pulled the Dead Sea's plug . Eli Dior, an Israeli official, explained the problem \\"The Dead Sea is drying up. Every year, the surface falls about one meter, and as the water level falls, shallow areas are left high and dry.\\" Over the last half-century, the five neighboring countries have used up almost all the water flowing into the Dead Sea to meet human and agriculture needs. Result the Dead Sea is being emptied.               With population in the neighbouring countries to double at least in the next 50 years, there is little hope of restoring the water being used in this area. No country has a drop to spare for the Dead Sea, where they know it will just evaporate. To dream of opening the dams and restoring natural balance is unrealistic. Yet one ambitious high-tech dream may turn out to be not only the solution to the Dead Sea but also a ticket to peace around its shores. The \\"Red-Dead\\" is a proposed 5 billion project to bring sea water some 240 kilometers by pipeline and canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. The Red-Dead may be the only solution, but even if the project is carried out successfully, the Dead Sea will be 10 to 20 meters lower than now and two thirds of its current size.

In a fiery statement, the North warned of strikes against the White House, Pentagon and \\"the whole US mainland\\". North Korea denies US claims it is behind cyber-attacks linked to a film that features the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea has a long history of issuing threats against the US. The latest statement comes days after the US formally accused the North of orchestrating a massive cyber-attack on Sony Pictures. \\"The army and people of the DPRK [North Korea] are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces including cyber warfare space,\\" a long statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea frequently uses fierce rhetoric against both South Korea and the United States so there's no great step-up in fierceness. And it is for domestic consumption as well as for outsiders. The statement has weight because it comes from the most powerful body in North Korea, the National Defence Commission, which is chaired by Kim Jong-un. It has two arguments - essentially \\"we didn't do it\\" and \\"whoever did do it was right\\". The statement goes into some detail about the FBI argument that there were signs in the computer code that North Korea was behind the Sony attack. It said such lines of code are commonplace and do not prove any North Korean involvement. It accused US President Barack Obama of \\"recklessly making the rumour\\" that North Korea was behind the Sony attack. Separately, North Korea said it would not attend Monday evening's UN Security Council meeting discussing the country's human rights record. Last week, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling on the Security Council to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity. A UN report released in February revealed ordinary North Koreans faced \\"unspeakable atrocities\\", including \\"deliberate starvation, forced labour, executions, torture\\" and political repression. China, North Korea's main international ally, is expected to block any move against the country. The Sony hack resulted in unreleased films and the script for the next James Bond movie being leaked online. Details of corporate finances and private emails between producers and Hollywood figures were also released. The eventual fallout from the attack saw Sony cancel the Christmas release of a comedy called The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of the North Korean leader. That decision followed threats made by a group that hacked into Sony's servers and leaked sensitive information and emails. The North has denied being behind the attacks, and offered to hold a joint inquiry with the US. But the US turned down the offer, and President Obama said it was considering putting the North back on its list of terrorism sponsors, a move that further angered Pyongyang. North Korea had been on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism for two decades until the White House removed it in 2008, as part of now-stalled negotiations relating to Pyongyang's nuclear programme. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mr Obama promised to respond \\"proportionately\\" to the cyber-attack. \\"I'll wait to review what the findings are,\\" he said, adding that he did not think the attack \\"was an act of war\\". The US has reportedly also asked China to curb cyber-attacks by North Korea. China is seen as the nation with the most influence over Pyongyang. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a telephone conversation with his US counterpart John Kerry on Sunday in which they discussed the Sony row. Mr Wang said China was \\"against all forms of cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism\\" but did not refer directly to North Korea. Correspondents say the issue of hacking is a sensitive one in Sino-US relations, with the two sides frequently trading accusations of cyber-espionage. The Interview features James Franco and Seth Rogen as two journalists granted an audience with Mr Kim. The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. Sony says it made the decision to cancel its release after most US cinemas chose not to screen the film, following terrorism threats.","output":"North Korea threatens strikes against the US following accusations of being involved in the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures related to the controversial film depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also poor communication from seller. I WOULD NOT purchase anything from this seller.I am presently in a dispute with Amazon and the seller regarding not receive my Christmas CD Gift! Answer: The answer is:","output":"No, this product review is not positive. Here is a detailed explanation: The review in question exhibits multiple negative components, which indicates that the buyer had an unfavorable experience with the product, the seller, and the entire purchasing process. 1. The title of the review shows dissatisfaction and frustration on the part of the buyer. The use of \\"I did not receive the item\\" clearly states that a significant issue occurred during the purchasing process, as the buyer did not even receive the product that they ordered. 2. The mention of \\"poor communication from the seller\\" highlights a lack of proper customer service and interaction between the seller and the buyer. Communication is a crucial aspect of any business transaction, and inadequate communication can lead to confusion, delays, and dissatisfaction. 3. The buyer's statement \\"I WOULD NOT purchase anything from this seller\\" displays a complete lack of trust in the seller, and it signals that the buyer would not recommend this seller to others. This is a strong indication that the review is negative. 4. The buyer is \\"presently in a dispute with Amazon and the seller regarding not receiving my Christmas CD Gift!\\" This shows that the issue remains unresolved, and the buyer is actively seeking assistance from Amazon to rectify the situation. The fact that the buyer had to resort to a dispute signifies a breakdown in communication and problem-solving between the buyer and the seller. In conclusion, the product review is negative due to the various issues mentioned by the buyer. These issues include not receiving the product, poor communication from the seller, a lack of trust in the seller, and an ongoing dispute with Amazon and the seller to resolve the problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Upon his appointment as Bishop of Wrocław in 1198, Jarosław of Opole, elder son of the Silesian duke Bolesław I the Tall, received the territories around the town of Nysa  from his father. After Jarosław's death in 1201, his half-brother Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia decided to leave Nysa, as well as the castellany of Otmuchów, under the control of the Diocese of Wrocław, while the rest of the late Jarosław's Upper Silesian lands were annexed by his uncle Mieszko IV Tanglefoot in the following year. In 1290 Henry IV Probus, duke of Lower Silesia at Wrocław, gave the bishops privileges of autonomy on their lands in Nysa, creating the legal basis for the Duchy of Nysa. Henry of Wierzbna, Bishop of Wrocław from 1302 to 1319, was the first to actually use the title of a Duke of Nysa. The duchy in its original form only lasted until 1335, when Silesia passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia by the Treaty of Trentschin. In 1342 Bishop Przecław of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind and afterwards played a vital role in the negotiations for the 1348 Treaty of Namslau between John's successor Charles IV and King Casimir III the Great of Poland. Pogorzeli also significantly enlarged his territory by acquisition of Grodków  from Duke Bolesław III the Generous of Brzeg in 1344. For the next two hundred years, the Polish, Czech and German inhabitants of Nysa-Grodków lived in relative harmony, even during the beginnings of the Reformation as the control of the region switched between Protestant and Catholic rulers. This ended with the Thirty Years' War. How many years was it between Jaroslaw's death and when Bishop Przeclaw of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind?","output":"Jarosław's death occurred in 1201. Bishop Przecław of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind in 1342.  To find the number of years between these two events, subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1342 - 1201 = 141 years So, there were 141 years between Jarosław's death and when Bishop Przecław of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – A Florida state law passed in the wake of the Parkland school shooting could be used to keep the suspected shooter's brother from getting his hands on a gun. Zachary Cruz, the 18-year-old brother of Nikolas Cruz, was arrested on trespassing charges Monday after he was seen skateboarding at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School about two hours after classes ended, police say, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Cruz, who'd been warned to keep away, said he'd made his third visit to the school since his brother allegedly killed 17 people to \\"reflect on the ... shooting,\\" say police. At a Tuesday hearing, however, prosecutors said the teen had \\"all the same flags\\" as his brother, seemed to admire his sibling's renown, and talked of starting a pen pal or fan club. Though a 25 bond is typical with a trespassing charge, the judge set bond at 500,000. Should Cruz post bail, he must wear an ankle monitor and keep away from the school and his brother, whom he's visited in jail, per CNN. BuzzFeed News reports he'll also undergo a mental health evaluation. Authorities, meanwhile, are seeking a risk protection order, made possible with a law signed by Gov. Rick Scott last week. Applied in cases of involuntary mental health assessments, the order would allow authorities to temporarily seize firearms in Cruz's possession and block him from acquiring new ones. Cruz's attorney, Joseph Kimok, said Tuesday \\"the state has been seeking to make a show of this,\\" per the Sun Sentinel. Cruz \\"is being held because of who he's related to, not because of anything he did.\\" Article:","output":"\\"Determining Guilt by Association? Zachary Cruz, Nikolas Cruz's Brother, and the Florida State Law\\" In a measure of preventive action taken by authorities, a Florida state law passed following the tragic Parkland school shooting could potentially obstruct Zachary Cruz, the brother of the alleged shooter, from obtaining a firearm. This peculiar case serves as an opportunity for us to delve into the precarious realm where the obligations of public safety are pitted against individual rights. Zachary Cruz, an 18-year-old and the sibling of Nikolas Cruz, was apprehended on charges of trespassing on Monday for skateboarding at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, some two hours after class had ended, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Despite prior warnings, he had deliberately disregarded them, visiting the site of the destructive event three times to \\"reflect on the [...] shooting,\\" according to police reports. Though the charge initially appears mundane, the situation took an unprecedented turn when prosecutors brought attention to the similarity between Zachary and his brother. In the Tuesday hearing, they stated that the teenager exhibited \\"all the same flags\\" as Nikolas Cruz and seemed to idolize his brother's infamy, even suggesting of starting a pen pal or fan club.  The standard 25 bond typical in trespassing charges skyrocketed to a staggering 500,000 under the judge's scrutiny. Further mandates issued, should Cruz indeed post bail, included wearing an ankle monitor and ensuring to keep a safe distance from both the school and his jailed brother. Scheduled mental health evaluations have also been reported by BuzzFeed News. Simultaneously, authorities have looked forward to implementing a risk protection order that has been recently enabled through a law endorsed by Gov. Rick Scott. This order, typically applicable in cases of involuntary mental health assessments, would permit authorities to temporarily confiscate any firearms owned by Cruz and prevent him from procuring new ones. However, this case has stirred its share of controversy, notably through Cruz's attorney, Joseph Kimok. He argued that the state is exploiting the situation for showmanship, according to the Sun Sentinel. His claim underlines the contention that Cruz is being unduly held due to his familial ties to Nikolas Cruz rather than any personal wrongdoing. This case prompts a broader dialogue on preventing potential threats to public safety and the extent to which the actions of a relative can incriminate an individual. Striking a balance between public interests and individual rights remains a significant challenge in mapping the course of preventative justice. It may also raise the question of what parameters define the concept of complicity and whether mere familial connections and perceived psychological similarities are sufficient to warrant preventive punitive measures.  The Zachary Cruz case presents a complex narrative where laws drafted in crisis response intersect with intricate questions of fairness, justice, and individual freedoms. As we follow its continuous unfolding, major lessons in law, human rights, and society's moral compass may be keenly unmasked for us to grapple with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The ribs are connected to the sternum through the cartilage in the \\"chondrosternal\\" joint. When that cartilage gets inflamed — usually from strenuous activity  — you can feel chest pain from costochondritis. Exercise may also strain chest muscles, leading to musculoskeletal pain that feels like costochondritis.  The pain can be sharp, aching, or feel like pressure on the chest. You usually will feel it only when you move or breathe. However, these two causes of chest pain are the only ones that can be reproduced by putting pressure on the area with your hand.  To tell the difference between musculoskeletal and cartilage joint pain, press on the the ribs around the sternum (bone in center of your chest). If there's pain next to the sternum, chances are you have costochondritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen will ease the pain from cartilage and muscular chest pain. These drugs suppress the inflammation process — whether in the cartilage or the muscles — reducing the conditions that cause pain. Take 2 pills or tablets with water and food. The food helps prevent irritation of the stomach. The pain from these conditions is self-limiting, meaning that it will go away with time instead of lingering. However, you need to rest your strained muscles and your rib joints to give the damaged tissue a chance to heal. If you don't want to stop exercising completely, at least reduce the exercises that put stress on the chest area. If you don't adequately stretch your muscles before strenuous activity, you will feel tightness and pain in them after you stop. This is the last thing you want when you're experiencing cartilage or muscle pain. Before beginning your exercise sessions, make sure to stretch the muscle groups in the chest:  Lift your arms straight over your head, then stretch as far to the back and sides as you can. Really let your chest muscles expand and relax as you do this. While facing a corner, stretch your arms out fully and place one hand on each wall. Move your hands further apart from each other, letting your chest come closer to the wall in the process. With your feet planted on the ground, get a firm hold of the sides of an open door. Lunge your chest forward, holding your body up by your grip on the doorframe. You can also simply walk forward while holding onto the doorframe. Heat can be an effective therapy for ongoing muscle or joint issues, and can ease this type of chest pain. Place the heat pad in the microwave and heat as described in the directions. Place it over the painful areas intermittently so you don't burn yourself. The heat will loosen the tension in your muscles and promote healing. You can also massage the area after applying heat with the pads of your fingers to further loosen the muscles. Taking a warm bath with a cup of Epsom's salts in the water can also ease the pain in your cartilage and muscles. If you're continuously straining your chest muscles, don't expect the pain to go away quickly. However, if the pain lingers even with plenty of rest, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor. Seek immediate attention if you were in an accident involving chest trauma. A broken rib can damage the lungs and heart if left untreated. Your doctor may perform an x-ray to note any broken bones. What is a summary?","output":"Costochondritis and musculoskeletal pain are two common causes of chest pain, which can result from strenuous activity and insufficient stretching. To differentiate between them, apply pressure to the ribs around the sternum; pain near the sternum indicates costochondritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help alleviate pain from both conditions. To prevent and alleviate pain, ensure proper rest, reduce exercises that put stress on the chest, and stretch the chest muscles before exercising. Applying heat and taking a warm bath with Epsom salts can also help with pain relief.

It was founded in the 1940s on the site of a former farm known as Supio's farm, offering new housing for returning GIs and their families. Overbrook Park remains a stable, safe middle-class neighborhood. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Supio's farm was never a farm.","output":"The sentence \\"Supio's farm was never a farm\\" does not logically follow the preceding text, as it contradicts the information presented earlier in the passage. The first part of the provided text explicitly states that Overbrook Park was founded in the 1940s on the site of a former farm known as Supio's farm, indicating that Supio's farm once existed as a farm location. Introducing the idea that Supio's farm was never a farm creates confusion and contradicts the historical context of the Overbrook Park neighborhood's origins, as stated in the initial passage. The development of Overbrook Park on the land that once belonged to Supio's farm speaks to the growth and transformation that many American communities experienced during the post-World War II era. The neighborhood was established to provide returning veterans and their families with new housing opportunities in a safe and stable environment. This context is crucial in understanding the history and formation of Overbrook Park and acknowledging the significance of Supio's farm as a former agricultural site that played a part in the neighborhood's foundation. To maintain coherence and consistency with the facts provided about Overbrook Park and Supio's farm, a statement like \\"The transformation of Supio's farm into a residential neighborhood marked a significant change in land use and the evolution of the community\\" would be a more suitable sentence to follow the given text.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Self-compassion is the extension of acceptance and empathy to yourself. Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements:  Self-kindness. We’re sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others. Common humanity. It can be easy to believe you’re the only one capable of imperfections and guilt, but making errors and experiencing pain are part of what makes us human. Understanding that you’re not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you. Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: it’s the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, “I’m so unattractive, nobody will love me,” a mindfulness approach might be something like, “I’m experiencing the feeling that I’m unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today.” Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere. We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, they’re not; they are usually based in fear.  Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of “poor me” that you may experience when things don’t go your way; for example, “My colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me.” Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, “My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can’t control how others respond to our work.” Self-compassion isn’t laziness. Accepting yourself doesn’t mean that you don’t want to improve yourself. It just means that you won’t be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others. Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement. While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and it’s important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, it’s the most confident people who know the least about a situation. Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and we’re very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we aren’t worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it’s an internal judgment.  Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you don’t deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love. This doesn’t come naturally to most people, because we’re often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself.  Point out your strengths to yourself. We’re used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones. Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesn’t matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you’ll probably become less resistant to believing them. Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think “I’m a failure” if you haven’t succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, “I didn’t succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.” Remind yourself that you’re human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: “I am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.” Sometimes, you will do something that you didn’t want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friend’s feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences.  Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future. Accepting your mistakes doesn’t mean pretending they didn’t happen. It doesn’t even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth.","output":"Self-compassion is the practice of extending acceptance and empathy towards oneself, and it's essential for one's ability to give and receive love from others. It is comprised of three elements: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Self-kindness means treating yourself with understanding and patience, just as you would with a friend who made a mistake. Common humanity involves accepting that mistakes and pain are part of the human experience, and acknowledging that you are not alone in this. Mindfulness involves the practice of recognizing and accepting negative thoughts and emotions non-judgmentally, which helps to redirect one's thoughts more constructively. It is important to differentiate self-compassion from self-pity, laziness, or narcissism. Self-compassion simply means being kind to oneself during difficult times, while still taking responsibility for one's actions and striving for personal growth. Self-esteem is distinct from self-compassion, as it focuses more on external validation and how others view us, while self-compassion focuses on unconditional self-acceptance. Shame often leads to self-destructive behavior, making it crucial to identify and counteract these feelings of unworthiness. To build self-compassion, one can practice affirming their value, highlighting personal strengths, depersonalizing failures, and accepting their inherent human imperfections. Recognizing one's mistakes and using them as opportunities for personal growth is key in transforming guilt into development. In conclusion, self-compassion is an essential aspect of personal well-being and healthy relationships. It involves treating oneself with kindness, acknowledging the shared human experience of making mistakes, and practicing mindfulness. Cultivating self-compassion fosters an environment of personal growth, accountability, and a healthy self-esteem."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on calle kristiansson 's:    - instrument     - website     - years active     - caption     - birth name     - origin     - label     - genre       - birth date     - name     - background     - image     - associated acts     - occupation     Bio: calle kristiansson -lrb- born july 5 , 1988 in kristianstad -rrb- is a swedish singer , who came first runner-up in \`\` idol 2009 '' after the winner erik grönwall .

Firstly, the reviewer points out a concern regarding the establishment's health score, which is only 2 points away from being closed down. This suggests that the reviewer is unhappy or dissatisfied with the hygiene conditions of the place. They express their discontent by saying they \\"do not want food poisoning.\\" Additionally, the reviewer indicates that they have enjoyed eating at the place in the past, which might lead one to believe they have had positive experiences there. However, their current experience and the health score issue have overshadowed those positive memories, causing the reviewer to feel hesitant about visiting the establishment again. The reviewer goes on to say that they will give the place another chance in a few months, but only if the health score improves to 90 or above. This conditional statement reveals that their satisfaction with the place is heavily influenced by the health score, and the reviewer's overall sentiment is still negative due to their current concerns about the safety and cleanliness of the establishment. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be characterized as negative. The concerns regarding the health score and the fear of potential food poisoning have led the reviewer to express dissatisfaction with their current experience, despite having enjoyed eating there in the past. Their willingness to try the place again if the health score improves demonstrates that the overall negative sentiment could shift to a positive one, but only if the issues affecting their current dissatisfaction are resolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to analyze the sentiment embodied by the tweet, I would need the text or content of the tweet. However, since the tweet has not been provided, I can still give a general idea of how to describe the sentiment in a tweet. The sentiment of a tweet refers to the emotional or subjective response conveyed by the author's choice of words, tone, and context. This can range from positive, negative, neutral, or mixed sentiments along with other emotions like joy, excitement, surprise, anger, sadness, and frustration. Analyzing the sentiment of a tweet helps us gain insight into the mindset of the person tweeting, their overall communication style, and how their content may be received by others. Here's a general approach to evaluating the sentiment of a tweet: 1. Identify the main subject or topic of the tweet: Understanding the core message can provide context to the sentiment being expressed. 2. Analyze the choice of words: Positive words (e.g., love, great, happy) usually indicate a positive sentiment, whereas negative words (e.g., hate, terrible, sad) can reflect a negative sentiment. Neutral words or factual statements with no emotional expressions usually indicate a neutral sentiment. 3. Pay attention to emotional expressions: Emojis, capitalization, exclamation marks, and certain phrases can all provide insight into the emotional tone of the tweet. 4. Consider the context: Previous tweets, current events, and the general atmosphere on social media can also help determine the sentiment in a tweet. 5.

He briefly discusses the hollow earth theories of John Symmes and Cyrus Teed among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories. Archaeologists Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of Sumerian albinos living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid mole men as their slaves to harvest mushrooms, their primary food source, since mushrooms can grow without sunlight. The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient Mesopotamia. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar, which is really natural light coming from the surface. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural Caucasian skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \\"mark of darkness.\\" They believe the men are messengers of Ishtar, their goddess. When one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods.

The board game could not be played on the table because the","output":"table was not sturdy enough to hold the weight and physical requirements of the game, leading to a potential collapse and damage to both the game components and the table itself. Furthermore, there were several other factors that impeded the progress of the game, which could have impacted the overall enjoyment for the players, as described below. First and foremost, the table's dimensions and surface area were insufficient to accommodate the entire board game, including the main board, game pieces, player's cards, and any additional items required for gameplay. As a result, the game could not be laid out in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, creating difficulties for players to effectively engage in the game and reducing the overall game immersion and entertainment value. Secondly, the uneven surface of the table further complicated the playing experience. The irregular and sloped plane of the table made it difficult for players to arrange their game pieces and execute moves without the risk of them sliding or toppling over. This inherent instability would severely disrupt the flow of the game as players would need to constantly reposition their pieces, leading to possible misplacements and frustration. In addition, the table's appearance and material were not conducive to the game environment desired. The table's design, specifically its color and pattern, clashed with the board game's aesthetics, making it visually distracting and perplexing for players to focus on the game. Moreover, the table's material – particularly if it were made from glass or a similar, smooth surface – could have caused glare or reflection issues, further hindering the players' ability to concentrate on the board and make strategic decisions. Another factor to consider is the impact of external elements surrounding the table, such as the chairs and the lighting. The chairs may not have been comfortable enough to support extended periods of gameplay, causing physical discomfort and detracting from players' immersion in the game. Furthermore, inadequate or excessively bright lighting could have cast shadows or caused reflections on the table surface, obstructing players' vision and negatively impacting their gameplay experience. Considering these impediments and potential discomforts, it became clear that the board game could not be played on the table. To ensure the best possible gaming experience, it would be advisable to identify a more suitable playing surface that meets the required dimensions and stability standards, offers a conducive aesthetic and material design, and provides a comfortable seating arrangement, thereby guaranteeing an enjoyable and engrossing board game session for all the players involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing , invasive plant species , wildfires , and climate change . Question: how does sagebrush effect community idaho A:","output":"Yes, your answer addresses multiple factors affecting Sagebrush ecosystems, such as human settlements, agriculture, livestock grazing, invasive species, wildfires, and climate change. However, to better answer the question about how Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) affects communities in Idaho, consider discussing its ecological importance, its significance for wildlife, its role in sustaining Idaho's heritage, and the ongoing efforts to conserve and protect Sagebrush habitats. Artemisia tridentata, commonly known as sagebrush, is a keystone species and the most prevalent shrub in the vast sagebrush steppe ecosystem, which spans across a large portion of the Western United States, including Idaho. Sagebrush plays several important roles within this ecosystem and has various effects on communities in Idaho: 1. Ecological Importance: Sagebrush performs essential ecological functions like soil conservation and providing habitats for numerous native plant and animal species. The sagebrush ecosystem is home to more than 350 species of plants and animals, contributing to Idaho's rich biodiversity. 2. Wildlife Support: Many species depend on sagebrush for food, cover, and breeding grounds. Notably, the Greater Sage-Grouse, a ground-dwelling bird native to the Western United States, utilizes sagebrush habitats for nesting, brood-rearing, and winter survival. This bird plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, and the maintenance of viable sagebrush habitats is vital for their conservation. 3. Cultural Significance: Sagebrush is part of the rich heritage of Idaho and the larger Western United States. It symbolizes the rugged beauty of the American West and has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for a variety of medicinal and spiritual purposes. 4. Conservation: Understanding the many threats facing sagebrush ecosystems is important for Idaho communities to manage and protect these habitats. Initiatives and collaborations such as the Sage Grouse Initiative and the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Foundation have been established to ensure the conservation and restoration of sagebrush habitats in the state. In conclusion, sagebrush has a meaningful impact on communities in Idaho through its ecological importance, supporting native wildlife, preserving Idaho's heritage, and providing a focal point for crucial conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances.

British troops were seen rappelling quickly from helicopters while others parachuted from planes. The practice manouevres took place five miles off the coast of RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales. The training missions honed techniques which could be used by elite troops in a shock attack on ISIS. Manchester taxi-driver-turned-aid worker Alan Henning, 47, has been held by IS since last December and earlier this month, they threatened to kill him in the same video which showed the beheading of fellow Briton David Haines. Another British hostage, the journalist John Cantlie, has now been held by IS since November 2012, and last month appeared on a YouTube video. In the two-week long training exercise launched from RAF Valley – where Prince William served as a search and rescue pilot – various scenarios were rehearsed to prepare troops for whatever might lie ahead. In one, troops leapt out of RAF Lynx and Merlin helicopters, zipping down ropes in a mock offensive. They were also spotted in a daring manoeuvre launching fast boats from the back of a Chinook helicopter which was flown just inches above the water at breath-taking speed. Manchester taxi-driver-turned-aid worker Alan Henning, 47, has been held by ISIS since last December. British journalist John Cantlie has now been held by ISIS since November 2012 and last month appeared on a YouTube video released by the militants. Alan Henning appeared in a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines by Jihadi John. Servicemen were also seen leaping from two RAF Hercules transport planes during the exercise, which saw various routines carried out late in the evening until around midnight. A hostage rescue mission in hostile territory would be one of the most hazardous missions imaginable. In 1979, a top-secret attempt by US special forces to free American hostages held in Tehran, Iran, ended in disaster with the death of eight soldiers when two of the aircraft involved – a helicopter and a Hercules – collided and were engulfed in flames. The British Government has ruled out deploying ground troops against IS militants as the RAF joined air strikes against the extremists in Iraq yesterday. But that hasn’t stopped military commanders ensuring UK troops are at maximum readiness to strike in a targeted assault. Security services have identified six plots involving jihadi fanatics who have returned from Syria to launch attacks in Europe. One involved a gun and bomb attack in London which was to be carried out on the orders of a terrorist mastermind in the Middle East. As reported in The Mail on Sunday earlier this year, counter-terrorism officers working with MI5 detained a man who had returned to London from Syria with substantial amounts of cash which he used to buy weapons and bomb-making equipment. The suspect joined up with another extremist, and security officials arrested them at gunpoint. David Cameron warned of the six thwarted plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against ISIS. The other plots were uncovered in France, Italy and the Netherlands, but the men were not charged with terrorism offences, security sources said. David Cameron referred to the six plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against Islamic State. He said: ‘This international operation is about protecting our people too, and protecting the streets of Britain should not be a task that we are prepared to entirely subcontract to other air forces of other countries. This is not a threat on the far side of the world.’ One plot was not disrupted. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, who had fought with IS in Syria, was arrested after three people were shot and killed in a Jewish museum in Brussels.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Carbohydrate Digestion The average American diet is about 50 percent carbohydrates, which may be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and/or complex sugars (polysaccharides). Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the three monosaccharides that are commonly consumed and are readily absorbed. Your digestive system is also able to break down the disaccharide sucrose (regular table sugar: glucose + fructose), lactose (milk sugar: glucose + galactose), and maltose (grain sugar: glucose + glucose), and the polysaccharides glycogen and starch (chains of monosaccharides). Your bodies do not produce enzymes that can break down most fibrous polysaccharides, such as cellulose. While indigestible polysaccharides do not provide any nutritional value, they do provide dietary fiber, which helps propel food through the alimentary canal. The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the ‘heavy lifting’ for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure 23.29). After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme α-dextrinase starts working on αdextrin, breaking off one glucose unit at a time. Three brush border enzymes hydrolyze sucrose, lactose, and maltose into monosaccharides. Sucrase splits sucrose into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose; maltase breaks down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactase breaks down lactose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. Insufficient lactase can lead to lactose intolerance.   Q: Making ups about 50 percent of the modern american diet, what food group can be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars and/or complex sugars?

As usual, Hart is the show's heart & soul. \\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\\" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was. I only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy. 10/10 Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

Definition: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head can be hindered by what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, hindering introduces hindrances that obstruct the natural path to the achievement of a goal. For example, the event PersonX adopts a cat can be obstructed if PersonX is allergic to cats. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person,  and/or an action. Input: Head: PersonX becomes PersonY's wife<sep>Tail: to attend the sedding reception Output:","output":"No In this input, the Head is \\"PersonX becomes PersonY's wife\\" and the Tail is \\"to attend the wedding reception.\\" The task is to determine if the Tail can hinder the Head.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Plot title: Night Moves Movie plot: Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) is a retired professional football player now working as a private investigator in Los Angeles. He discovers that his wife Ellen (Susan Clark) is having an affair with a man named Marty Heller (Harris Yulin). Aging actress Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward) hires Harry to find her 16-year-old daughter Delly Grastner (Melanie Griffith). Arlene's only source of income is her daughter's trust-fund, but it requires Delly to be living with her. Arlene gives Harry the name of one of Delly's friends in L.A., a mechanic called Quentin (James Woods). Quentin tells Harry that he last saw Delly at a New Mexico film location, where she started flirting with one of Arlene's old flames, stuntman Marv Ellman (Anthony Costello). Harry realises that the injuries to Quentin's face are from fighting the stuntman and sympathises with his bitterness towards Delly. He travels to the film location and talks to Marv and stunt coordinator, Joey Ziegler (Edward Binns). Before returning to L.A., Harry is surprised to see Quentin working on Marv's stunt plane. Harry suspects that Delly may be trying to seduce her mother's ex-lovers and travels to the Florida Keys, where her stepfather Tom Iverson (John Crawford) lives. In Florida, Harry finds Delly staying with Tom and a woman named Paula (Jennifer Warren). Harry, Paula and Delly take a boat trip to go swimming, but Delly becomes distraught when she finds the submerged wreckage of a small plane with the decomposing body of the pilot inside. Paula marks the spot with a buoy and when they return to shore, she appears to report the find to the Coast Guard. Harry persuades Delly to return to her mother in California.

Then, rub both of your hands together to spread it over your palms.","output":"Once you have thoroughly spread the Vicks Vaporub over your palms, proceed with the following steps: 1. Identify the target area: Determine the area of the body where you want to apply the Vicks Vaporub. Common areas include the chest, throat, and back for cold and cough relief, as well as sore muscles and joints for pain relief. 2. Apply the Vicks Vaporub: Gently massage the Vicks Vaporub onto the designated area using circular motions and gentle pressure. Ensure that you cover the entire area with a thin, even layer, avoiding the face and sensitive regions like the nostrils, eyes, and lips. Vicks Vaporub should not be applied to broken or irritated skin. 3. Massage the area: Continue massaging the area for a few minutes to help the skin absorb the Vicks Vaporub. The act of massaging not only promotes absorption but may also help to provide additional relief by stimulating blood flow to the area, and further relaxing tight muscles. 4. Apply more Vaporub if needed: If you feel that the initial layer was not enough to cover the entire target area, scoop a little more Vaporub onto your hands and repeat the rubbing and massaging process. Remember, it is important not to overuse or excessively apply the product. 5. Wash your hands: Once you have finished applying and massaging the Vicks Vaporub, ensure that you clean your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. This will help to avoid any accidental contact with your eyes or other sensitive areas. 6. Dress appropriately: To allow the Vicks Vaporub to work effectively, it is essential to wear loose and comfortable clothes that let your skin breathe. If you applied the Vaporub to your chest or throat, wearing a breathable, low-cut t-shirt may be ideal. For application to your back, consider wearing a light, loose-fitting shirt. 7. Wait and relax: Give the Vicks Vaporub time to work as its active ingredients – menthol, camphor, and eucalyptus oil – help to alleviate your symptoms. The menthol and camphor provide a cooling sensation, which can help soothe aches, pains, and congestion, while the eucalyptus oil may aid in reducing cough frequency. 8. Reapply as needed: Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may need to reapply the Vicks Vaporub every few hours or as instructed on the product label. Be sure to read and follow the directions for proper usage, and do not exceed the recommended application frequency. Remember, Vicks Vaporub is only intended for external use and should not be ingested or applied inside the nostrils. Keep the product away from children to avoid accidental ingestion or incorrect application. If your symptoms persist or worsen, consult your healthcare provider for further guidance and treatment options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the following context:  Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...  answer the following question:  What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What group did the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts contribute to their album? ?  After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who instinctively uses their abilities to convince their supervisor that they are a different class? ?  A sudden disease called the Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration kills nearly 90% of the children throughout the United States, leaving the  survivors with unusual abilities. As a result, the government place the survivors in a \\"rehabilitation camp\\", where they attempt to control them. One classification is splitting them into different color groups, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Red.  Ruby Daly celebrates her tenth birthday with her family. Seeing her parents' concern about the disease, Ruby goes to comfort her parents in the night, touching their hands, and inadvertently erasing all their memories of her existence. In the morning, her mother locks Ruby in the garage; having no recollection of her, she sends Ruby to an internment camp, where Ruby is found to be an Orange, the 2nd most dangerous class, where they have the ability to control other people's minds and memories. When they were classifying Ruby, she instinctively uses her abilities to convince her supervisor that she is a Green, the least dangerous group, the one with high intelligence. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who instinctively uses their abilities to convince their supervisor that they are a different class is Ruby Daly. In the article, Ruby is found to be an Orange, which is considered the 2nd most dangerous class due to their ability to control other people's minds and memories. However, she instinctively uses her abilities to convince her supervisor that she is a Green, the least dangerous group with high intelligence.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.  answer the following question:  What is the scientific name of the animal that forms herds of 20 to 300 individuals?

Choose from: * yes * no","output":"No, the answer provided does not correctly identify the medical scientist who first proposed the clonal selection theory of immunology. The statement you provided explains a modification made to the theory in response to new discoveries. The correct answer to your question is Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet.  Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, an Australian immunologist and virologist, first proposed the Clonal Selection Theory of Immunology in the 1950s. This theory has become a central concept in our understanding of how the immune system functions. It provides an explanation for how the immune system is capable of generating a vast range of different antibody specificities in response to foreign antigens. According to the Clonal Selection Theory, the body produces a diverse pool of lymphocytes, each with a unique antigen receptor (either a B cell receptor or a T cell receptor). When a lymphocyte encounters its specific antigen, it binds to it, which results in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of the lymphocyte, ultimately leading to an immune response tailored to that specific antigen. Over the years, the Clonal Selection Theory has been refined and adapted to accommodate new discoveries in immunology, such as the understanding of histocompatibility and the \\"two-signal\\" activation of T cells. Histocompatibility refers to how compatible the immune cells of different individuals are, which is influenced by molecules called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) that are present on the surface of cells. The \\"two-signal\\" model of T cell activation involves the interaction of the T cell receptor with an antigen presented by MHC molecules and the simultaneous interaction with costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. This model explains how T cells are activated in a specific and tightly regulated way. In conclusion, the medical scientist responsible for proposing the Clonal Selection Theory of Immunology is Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Although the theory has seen modifications and enhancement due to new discoveries over time, it remains an essential framework for understanding the immune system."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Mrs Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) has just become a widow.

Short movie review: far too sentimental  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given short movie review, it is clear that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. The phrase \\"far too sentimental\\" indicates that the critic found the film's emotional aspects to be excessive and overly sappy, which detracts from the overall quality of the movie. This suggests that the critic did not appreciate the movie's attempt to evoke intense emotions in the viewers, as it might have come across as forced or contrived.  The use of the word \\"far\\" emphasizes the severity of the sentimentality in the movie, further reinforcing the negative viewpoint. By saying \\"far too sentimental,\\" it is implied that the movie went beyond what the critic would consider an acceptable level of emotive storytelling. This could mean that the movie heavily relied on cheap tear-jerker scenes or clichéd emotional elements to attempt to create a deep connection with the audience. However, in the eyes of the critic, these attempts failed and only contributed negatively to the overall viewing experience. The negative sentiment in the review could also be perceived as a disappointment in the lack of balance in the film. Perhaps the movie was so focused on evoking strong emotions that it neglected other vital aspects of filmmaking, such as character development, engaging plotlines, or strong dialogue. This lack of balance might have made the film fall short of creating the intended impact and left the critic unsatisfied with the overall result. In conclusion, the critic's view of the movie is undoubtedly negative due to the use of the phrase \\"far too sentimental.\\" This single phrase encapsulates the dissatisfaction and disappointment that the critic feels about the film, which mainly stems from the movie's excessive reliance on emotion to appeal to the audience. This overemphasis on sentimentality could have potentially overshadowed other critical aspects of filmmaking that the critic, and likely other potential viewers, would have preferred to see prioritized and executed effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''

In this view, God crafted the universe in such a way that it is governed by a set of unchanging, fundamental laws. These natural laws, which can be discovered and understood through careful observation and scientific inquiry, govern every aspect of the universe, from the movement of celestial bodies to the functioning of living organisms. Newton believed that these natural laws were an expression of God's divine plan and purpose, demonstrating His omnipotence, wisdom, and design. The regularity and predictability of natural phenomena served as evidence of God's existence and His sovereign control over the world. For Newton, understanding these laws and principles was not only the pursuit of scientific knowledge but also a means to appreciate and worship the divine intellect behind the creation of the universe. This perspective, aligned with the theological works of William Whewell and Francis Bacon, sought to harmonize science and religion, asserting that the study of natural laws can deepen one's understanding of God and His creation.

It talked with insects . It found lots of different pieces, but none of them fitted. So it left them all by the side of the road and kept on looking for the missing piece. Then one day the circle found a piece that fitted perfectly, it put the missing piece into itself. It could be whole, with nothing missing. It was so happy and began to roll. Now that it was a perfect circle, it could roll very fast, too fast to see flowers or talk to insects. It realized how different the world was when it rolled so quickly.

You are given a new situation: Two islands were located in the Pacific Ocean. Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems.  and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Please answer this question : Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters? The answer to this question is:","output":"Mud island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters. Step-by-step justification: 1. The hint mentions that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. 2. As the plates move, stresses build, and when the stresses build too much, the rocks break, releasing energy and causing an earthquake. 3. During an earthquake, rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes this phenomenon. 4.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on? Options: - The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move - not enough information - The woman who had to move - The wife of the man who offered his seat The answer is:","output":"The woman who had to move"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two sentences convey the same meaning, but they use different words - \\"assumed\\" and \\"deduced\\". Both of these words refer to a process of reasoning or drawing a conclusion based on the information provided or evidence observed. However, they can have slightly different connotations. 'Assumed' typically implies that the conclusion is reached based on preliminary or incomplete evidence, and there might be some uncertainty involved. It suggests that he could have made an educated guess based on the fact that he saw two black hats, without complete certainty. 'Deduced', on the other hand, implies a more definitive conclusion based on logical reasoning.

For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son.

We need to evaluate each of these choices in the context of what can get a prisoner in more trouble. Step 2: Assess each choice in terms of potential trouble - Dream of freedom: This is a thought or mental state, and while it may cause emotional stress for the prisoner, thinking about freedom will not necessarily get them in more trouble. - Attempt to escape: Escaping from jail represents a direct disobedience to the rules and regulations of the prison system. Making an attempt to break free is likely to bring significant consequences, such as punishment or increased security measures. - Do time: \\"Doing time\\" means serving the sentence assigned to the prisoner. This is what the prisoner is expected to do, and doing so should not get them in more trouble. - Fast for days: Fasting for an extended period may raise concerns about a prisoner's health, but it is not a direct violation of the rules in most prisons. It may draw attention, but it's not likely to create more trouble than attempting to escape. - Scape jail: This choice appears to be a misspelling of \\"escape jail.\\" Since \\"attempt to escape\\" is already included in our choice selection and offers a more accurate wording, we can eliminate this choice as redundant. Step 3: Choose the answer based on the assessed consequences - Based on our assessment, \\"attempt to escape\\" is the most likely choice to get a prisoner in more trouble. Escaping from jail involves direct disobedience to the rules and can result in increased security measures, punishment, and even a longer sentence. Thus, the rationale to choose \\"attempt to escape\\" as the answer is that attempting to escape from jail represents a significant breach of the rules of the prison system, and it carries with it the risk of severe consequences such as punishment, increased security, and a longer sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How can I mount a poster in my bedroom wall? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of mounting a poster in your bedroom wall, I suggest the following steps and their justification: 1. Choose the location for the poster: Determine the wall and the specific spot in your bedroom where you'd like to mount the poster. Justification: Choosing a suitable location will ensure proper visibility and complement the overall room aesthetics. 2. Gather required tools and materials: Some possible materials you could use to mount the poster include adhesive tape, poster putty, or mounting strips. A level might also be useful for proper alignment. Justification: Having the right tools and materials helps mount the poster securely and maintain its position. 3. Prepare the poster: Carefully unroll the poster on a flat surface, and press it down gently with books or other flat objects to straighten it out if needed. Justification: Preparing the poster in advance will make it easier to handle and prevent any damage or wrinkles during the mounting process. 4. Clean and dry the wall area: Wipe down the area on the wall where you plan to mount the poster with a damp cloth, then dry it with a towel or let it air dry. Justification: Cleaning the wall surface ensures better adhesion of the mounting materials and reduces the chances of the poster falling. 5. Measure and align the poster: Hold the poster up to the wall in your chosen location and use a level to make sure it's aligned horizontally. Mark the top corners of the poster on the wall lightly with a pencil. Justification: Proper alignment ensures the poster is displayed evenly and looks pleasing to the eye. 6. Apply the mounting material to the poster: If using adhesive tape or mounting strips, apply them to the back of the poster at each corner and along the edges as needed, following the product's instructions. If using poster putty, roll it into small balls and apply it to each corner and along the edges. Justification: Properly securing the mounting materials to the poster will ensure a stable and durable mount. 7. Attach the poster to the wall: Line up the top of the poster with the marks you made on the wall earlier. Gently press the poster onto the wall, starting with the top corners and working your way down. Rub over the areas where the mounting material is located to improve the adhesion to the wall. Justification: Attaching the poster carefully and firmly to the wall ensures that it remains in place and is displayed correctly. 8. Inspect and adjust if necessary: Step back and take a look at the mounted poster. If any adjustments are needed, gently remove the poster from the wall, reposition it, and reattach it as needed.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather?  Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

Given the following context:  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the only child of  Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns?

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Answer this question: who did the navajo code talkers work for??","output":"The Navajo Code Talkers worked for the United States Marine Corps during World War II, playing a crucial role in the communication and transmission of secure messages in the Pacific Theater. The concept of using the Navajo language as a basis for an unbreakable code was developed by Philip Johnston, a WWI veteran and son of a missionary who had grown up on the Navajo reservation and became fluent in the Navajo language. He proposed the idea to the U.S. military in 1942, and after a successful demonstration, the Marine Corps established the Navajo Code Talker program. The Navajo Code Talkers were a specially recruited group of young Navajo men who were native speakers of the Dine (Navajo) language. The code they utilized was kept completely confidential and was based on a combination of the Navajo language, a substitution alphabet, and a set of code words representing military terms and concepts. The complexity of the Navajo language, including its syntax, tonal qualities, and unique linguistic features, made it particularly suitable for the development of a highly secure code. As Navajo is an unwritten language with a limited number of speakers, it was extremely difficult for non-Navajo speakers to learn or understand, making it virtually impossible for the enemy to crack the code. The Navajo Code Talkers were enlisted as Marines and underwent rigorous training to become proficient radio operators and signalmen. They were also trained to encrypt and decipher messages in the Navajo code, which they could do with remarkable speed and accuracy. The first batch of 29 Navajo Code Talkers was sent to the Pacific theater in 1942, and their performance in the Battle of Guadalcanal proved the value of their skills. By the end of World War II, approximately 400 Navajo Code Talkers served in the Marine Corps. The Navajo Code Talkers participated in numerous key battles in the Pacific Theater, including the Solomon Islands, Tarawa, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Their secure communication lines allowed the U.S. military to transmit vital information, coordinate troop movements, and call for support, making a significant impact on the outcome of these battles. The admirals and generals who oversaw the Pacific operations, including Admiral Chester Nimitz and General Alexander Vandegrift, acknowledged the crucial contributions of the Navajo Code Talkers in securing American victories in the Pacific. The Navajo Code Talker program remained classified for over two decades after World War II, and the Code Talkers' role and contributions were only fully recognized after the program's declassification in 1968. In 2001, President George W. Bush awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers, followed by Congressional Silver Medals to the other Navajo Code Talkers. Today, the Navajo Code Talkers are celebrated as true American heroes, and their service and dedication to the United States Marine Corps during World War II stand as a testament to their loyalty, skill, and courage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Causeways can be made of various materials like earth, stone, or wood. 2. Bridge: A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle like a body of water, a valley, or a road, without closing the way underneath. It is designed for the passage of pedestrians or vehicles and is typically made of reinforced concrete, steel, or other strong materials. 3. Culvert: A culvert is a structure allowing water to flow under a road, trail, or embankment, usually in the form of a pipe, a box, or an open channel. It is mainly designed to manage water flow and prevent erosion or flooding. Now, let's compare the questions: Question 1: How is a causeway different from a bridge? This question addresses the differences between a causeway, which is a raised road or path across unstable areas, and a bridge, which is a structure designed for spanning obstacles like water or valleys. Question 2: What is the difference between a culvert and a bridge? This question focuses on the differences between a culvert, which is mainly designed to manage water flow and prevent erosion, and a bridge, which is built for connecting points over obstacles.

Available choices:  a). yes.  b). it is not possible to tell.  c). no.","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"People always say you're just crazy but old people aren't\\" is true based on the given premise, we need to examine each part of the premise and the hypothesis itself. Here's a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that if somebody tells others about a certain situation, people would generally assume that the individual who is sharing the information is senile (meaning, they are old and have mental impairments due to age). The phrase \\"that ain't right neither\\" implies that the assumption about senility is also incorrect. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis \\"People always say you're just crazy but old people aren't\\" consists of two claims. The first claim is \\"People always say you're just crazy,\\" which suggests that people often dismiss such statements. The second claim is \\"But old people aren't,\\" indicating that the assumption about old people being senile is not accurate. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Comparing the two, we can see that the premise supports the notion that people may dismiss statements from older individuals due to assumptions about their senility, and the person saying the phrase believes that this assumption is incorrect. Step 4: Determine the validity of the hypothesis Based on the premise, the hypothesis aligns with the notion that people may assume old people are senile when they express certain concerns or statements, and the fact that this is an incorrect assumption. However, the hypothesis uses the word \\"always,\\" which might be too strong and not entirely accurate, as it suggests that people exclusively react this way.  Conclusion: Considering the analysis above, the closest answer choice would be: b). it is not possible to tell. Although the hypothesis aligns with the essence of the premise, the use of the word \\"always\\" makes it impossible to determine its absolute accuracy based on the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The Epithelial Cell Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface. Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach.   Q: What cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces?   A: Available options:  (a). mast cells.  (b). nerve cells.  (c). connective tissue.  (d). epithelial cells. The answer is:","output":"(d). epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces. This polarization allows the cells to carry out specialized functions based on their locations within the body. Moreover, certain structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to these specific functions. For instance, while certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides of epithelial cells, other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, can be found on the apical surface when present. Cilia are essential for processes like the movement of fluids and trapped particles in various parts of the body, such as the ventricles of the brain and the mucociliary escalator of the airway."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Color is very important in our daily life. It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use  _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s. In Thailand, for example, only kings, queens and members of the royal family could wear purple while in ancient China, yellow was the color1 reserved for the emperor and the empress.

Washington (CNN) -- When Paul Ryan struggled to explain a budget-balancing timeline under Mitt Romney, he highlighted the difficulty of trying to run a substantive campaign without being too specific.  While Ryan's interview Tuesday with Fox News' Brit Hume was no Sarah Palin-Katie Couric moment, the Republican vice presidential candidate's discomfort in answering when Romney's proposal would balance the budget was evident.  Ryan, a seven-term congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he was unsure when Romney's proposals would balance the federal budget. Romney's plans say he would \\"put the federal government on a course toward a balanced budget\\" but does not say when.  Mitt Romney's 5-point plan for the economy  Hume repeatedly pressed Ryan on the question of \\"when\\" Romney's budget would balance.  Hume: \\"The budget plan you're now supporting would get to balance when?\\"  Ryan: \\"Well, there are different -- the budget plan that Mitt Romney is supporting gets us down to 20% of GDP (gross domestic product) government spending by 2016. That means get the size of government back to where it historically has been. What President Obama has done is he brought the size of government to as high as it hasn't been since World War II.

When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government, as mentioned in the article, is Miriam. Miriam Makeba was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and musician from South Africa. She played a significant role in bringing global attention to the injustice of apartheid and advocating for civil rights, not only in South Africa but also for black people of African descent around the world."},{"instruction":"Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point.

This is because the high temperature will effectively boil the water, which helps in separating the salt from the water as the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter). What trait causes depleted uranium to be used in gyroscopic compasses?","output":"Depleted uranium is used in gyroscopic compasses because it has a very high density. This high density makes it a heavy and stable material, which is important for gyroscopes to work properly. Gyroscopes need a heavy spinning wheel to help them maintain their direction and balance. Since depleted uranium is heavier than other metals, it makes the gyroscope work better and more accurately for showing direction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Possible answers: 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"Your questions are a bit tricky, but I'll do my best to explain. In 2014, there was a big incident where someone stole private photos from celebrities' phones and computers. Imagine you have a toy that you really really like and don't want to share, but someone takes it from you without asking. That's pretty much what happened here. The people who took the photos got them by breaking into the celebrities' iCloud accounts, which is kind of like a big toy box where they keep their digital stuff.  As for the poor quality of the photos and videos, well it can be compared to sketching a picture. Sometimes when you draw a picture quickly, it doesn't come out as nice as when you take your time, right? Similarly, when these photos and videos are taken, they are often not intended to be seen by anyone else, so they might not look as good as photos the celebrities would share themselves. Regarding your multi-choice question, I would say that the answer is 1) no. These are not the same questions. They are related and talk about the same incident, but they are asking about different aspects of it. One is about how the photos were obtained, and the other is about why the photos might be of poor quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: Homes owned by a string of celebrities have vanished from Google’s Street View Map following draconian European privacy laws, it emerged yesterday. Mansions owned by Sir Paul McCartney, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and singer Katherine Jenkins are included in those that have disappeared from the controversial online tool. The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen. Scroll down for video. Now you see it... now you don't: Tony Blair's London home has been blurred out on Google Street View. Normal scene: How the London home belonging to Mr Blair (right), which is protected by police, normally looks. A mansion owned by Sir Paul McCartney are included in those that have vanished from Street View. But following a landmark ruling in a European court in favour of people’s ‘right to be forgotten’, the computer programme has seen dozens of requests from the rich and famous to have their homes removed. The house of former Beatles star McCartney can now not be seen on the 3-Dimensional online map, despite most of the London street that it is on being visible. A click of the mouse to show the west London home of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also comes up against a blank. Street View users are instead left having to view the distinctive property from a long distance away – blocking out any of the home’s features. Hidden: The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen (left)  is hidden from the public eye of Street View, as is the Surrey home of Katherine Jenkins (right) Privacy: Street View users can only view Katherine Jenkins' mansion from far away - and parts are blurred. The same barrier is in place at the Surrey home of Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. This is despite it being seen by millions of people when it featured in a series of the BBC One’s Apprentice. The world’s biggest search engine has also blurred out the £5million Georgian townhouse in central London where the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie live. Blair, who has made millions of pounds trading off his image and former office since leaving Downing Street, moved to the property, where he is continually protected by a police guard, in 2004. Caught on camera: A Google street-mapping car used to compile the online map. The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen and her husband Sam Cooper is also hidden from the public eye of Street View. It comes as the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland banker Fred Goodwin’s £3.5million Edinburgh mansion was revealed to have disappeared from the Google application last month. Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood, was held up as a figurehead for the bank’s disastrous crash in 2008 and the epitome of capitalist excess in the UK. A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a ‘compelling case’ to convince them to remove images of their homes. But it has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after European judges ruled in favour of citizens’ ‘right to be forgotten’. The legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed ‘inadequate, irrelevant or excessive’. It also allows people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant. Services such as Google Street View are thought not be covered by the ruling. Google has already disclosed that it has been asked by MPs, celebrities and public figures to have search results removed. It has employed a team of workers to evaluate each request. As seen on screen: The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen. Removal: A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a 'compelling case' to convince them to remove images of their homes. The Mail’s website, MailOnline has also received notification from Google of which links it has decided to remove. They include a story about Dougie McDonald, who was a Scottish top-flight football referee who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a Celtic v Dundee United match; a story about Tesco workers posting stories on social media attacking their workers; and a story about a Muslim man who accused Cathay Pacific, the airline, of refusing to employ him because of his name. The stories have not been removed by MailOnline, which described the move as similar to ‘burning books in a library’.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I began riding horses fairly recently, and, as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as I could, and I was surprised by the results. What I expected was a feel-good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. What I got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart. Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.","output":"The sentiment of this review is very positive! The person who wrote the review expected a typical movie with talking animals, but they found an amazing film with beautiful animation and an interesting storyline.

Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value soft drinks?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same. Both questions pertain to Walmart's private label brand, Great Value, but they address two different product categories: milk and soft drinks. 1. Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value Milk? This question focuses on the milk products sold under Walmart's private label brand, Great Value. It is generally known that large retailers like Walmart often do not manufacture their store-brand products themselves. Instead, they contract with different manufacturing companies to produce these goods according to their specifications. The manufacturing process for Great Value milk may involve various dairy suppliers and farms. This is because milk is a perishable item which requires a fresh supply, and Walmart operates thousands of stores across the United States. Consequently, local dairies that follow Walmart's strict quality and safety guidelines may be contracted to supply milk for the Great Value brand in specific regions. Walmart sources the milk for its private label brands from dairy farms that adhere to industry standards and regulations. 2. Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value soft drinks? This question pertains to the soft drinks sold under the Great Value brand. Similar to the milk products, these soft drinks are produced by various manufacturing companies on behalf of Walmart. Soft drinks typically have a longer shelf life than milk, which means they can be sourced from a slightly less diverse range of suppliers compared to milk. Walmart, like other retailers, maintains confidentiality around its specific manufacturing partners. However, it is likely that the company contracts with one or more beverage manufacturers to supply soft drinks for the Great Value brand. These manufacturers follow Walmart's quality and safety guidelines to ensure that the finished products meet consumer expectations. In summary, while both questions relate to the same private label brand, they address different product categories within that brand—milk and soft drinks. The questions inquire about the manufacturers associated with these specific products, which can vary, given that Walmart may contract different suppliers for each product category."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 9 August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, sparked days of violent protests in the town of Ferguson, prompting a heavy police crackdown. There is widespread anger against the mainly white police force for killing Mr Brown, who was unarmed. Mr Brown's family say his funeral will take place on Monday. US Attorney General Eric Holder is due to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet officials investigating the killing. Tuesday's police shooting has threatened to further inflame tensions within the community. According to police, in the early afternoon, two officers shot and killed a knife-wielding man four miles (6.4km) from the site of Mr Brown's killing. St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said witnesses reported the man had been behaving in an erratic manner, and emphasised the officers had a right to defend themselves. \\"The suspect turned toward officers, pulled out knife in an overhand grip, told officers to 'shoot me now, kill me now',\\" he told reporters. In another development in the Michael Brown case, the St Louis county prosecutor's office on Tuesday said it would present evidence against the officer who killed Mr Brown to a grand jury on Wednesday. The citizen panel will determine whether or not to charge Darren Wilson with a crime. Both St Louis officials and the US justice department are conducting investigations into the case, which has provoked demonstrations throughout the country. Witnesses have said Mr Brown was shot as he held his hands up in a position of surrender, while the police and supporters of Mr Wilson have said he fired during a fight with Mr Brown. An autopsy commissioned by Mr Brown's family concluded he had been shot six times, twice in the head. New York pathologist Dr Baden said his body showed no signs of a struggle. He also believed Mr Brown was not shot at close range as there was no gunpowder residue on his body, suggesting the officer was more than 2ft (60cm) away. On Monday night protests in Ferguson again turned violent, despite the presence of troops from the National Guard. Missouri Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson, who has led the police response since Thursday, said officers were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades after they came under \\"heavy gunfire\\" and were attacked with petrol bombs and bottles. He said two people were hit by gunfire from demonstrators, insisting that officers did not use their weapons. Capt Johnson appealed to demonstrators to protest in the daytime to prevent a \\"tiny minority of law breakers\\" from deliberately sparking violence. \\"Anyone who has been at these protests understands that there is a dangerous dynamic in the night: it allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos,\\" he told journalists. Those arrested include people from other states, including New York and California, Capt Johnson said. Correspondents say this suggests the protests are becoming more organised. Separately, President Barack Obama said he understood the \\"passions and anger\\" provoked by the death of the teenager. \\"In too many communities, too many young men of colour are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,\\" he said. 21,205 Population of Ferguson, Missouri 65% Black or black African 6% Police officers are black 9% Unemployed 21% Families living below the poverty line Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"On Tuesday, police officers in St. Louis shot dead a man who brandished a knife at them, leading to increased tension within the community and potentially further inflaming the situation. This incident is close to the site where Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot by a police officer on August 9th, sparking days of violent protests and a heavy police crackdown in Ferguson. The mainly white police force has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and US Attorney General Eric Holder is set to visit Ferguson to meet with officials investigating the killing. Both local and federal investigations are currently taking place, as protests continue. Witnesses have reported that Brown was shot with his hands up in a position of surrender, while police and supporters of the officer who killed Brown, Darren Wilson, have said he fired during a fight with Brown. Autopsy results commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head, without any signs of a struggle or gunshot residue on his body. Protests have continued to turn violent, with the use of tear gas and stun grenades by officers, and reports suggesting that the protests are becoming more organized as some demonstrators travel from other states. President Barack Obama has acknowledged the \\"passions and anger\\" provoked by the teenager's death, and the broader issue of how young men of color are perceived in many communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Lander and Dahlia Iyad.  for the following movie plot:  Michael Lander is a pilot who flies the Goodyear Blimp over National Football League games to film them for network television. Secretly deranged by years of torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he had a bitter court martial on his return and a failed marriage. He longs to commit suicide and to take with him as many as possible of the cheerful, carefree American civilians he sees from his blimp each weekend. Lander conspires with Dahlia Iyad, an operative from the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, to launch a suicide attack using a bomb composed of plastique and a quarter million steel flechettes, housed on the underside of the gondola of the blimp, which they will detonate over the Miami Orange Bowl during Super Bowl X. Dahlia and Black September, in turn, intend the attack as a wake-up call for the American people, to turn their attention and the world's to the plight of the Palestinians. American and Israeli intelligence, led by Mossad agent David Kabakov and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Sam Corley, race to prevent the catastrophe. After discovering the recording Dahlia made, meant to be played after the attack, they piece together the path of the explosives into the country, and Dahlia's own movements. The bomb-carrying blimp is chased by police helicopters as it approaches the stadium. Kabakov kills Lander and Iyad, but not before Lander lights the fuse to the blimp's bomb. Kabakov lowers himself from the helicopter to the blimp, hooks it up and hauls it out of the stadium and over the ocean where it blows up.

Article: On a grassy plain in South Africa,thousands of miles from home,two pairs of Zoo--bred South China tiger cubs----one-year-o1d Hope and Cathay and six-month-old Tiger Woods and Madonna--are learning to hunt in the wild.The hope is that they will one day pass on their skills to their young,allowing the next generation to get back to wildlife reserves in China. A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.  After reading the above, is \\"Electrons have a negative charge\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does an atom with more electrons than protons have?\\"?  + no. + yes.","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Electrons have a negative charge\\" is correct. Thus, the answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does an atom with more electrons than protons have?\\" would also be that it has a negative charge.  In the structure of an atom, it contains protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons carry no charge. In a neutrally charged atom, the number of protons and electrons is equal, nullifying each other's charges leading to an overall neutral charge. When there are more electrons than protons in an atom, it means there are more negative charges than positive charges. As such, the atom exhibits a net negative charge. Thus, when an atom has more electrons than protons, it becomes negatively charged due to the extra electrons, surpassing the number of protons that have positive charges. Further, when an object gains or loses electrons, this leads to the principle of charge conservation. This means the total amount of electric charge in a system does not change with time. If an atom loses an electron, it becomes positively charged, and when it gains an electron, it becomes negatively charged. This is the basic principle of the flow of electricity. The transfer or movement of these charged particles leads to what we know as electricity. Hence, the difference in the number of protons and electrons in an atom plays a crucial role in many aspects of science and technology, from the creation of electric currents to the properties of different materials. So, yes, an atom with more electrons than protons carries a negative overall electrical charge. It is the balance (or imbalance) of protons (positive charges) and electrons (negative charges) that determines the electric charge of an atom, particle, or object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might a milking machine be located? - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum  The best answer is","output":"A milking machine, a mechanical device commonly used in the dairy industry for efficient extraction of milk from cows, goats, sheep, or any other dairy-producing animals, would most likely be located in a barn or an industrial area. A barn is a popular agricultural building mainly used to house livestock. It is designed to accommodate animals, store feed, hay, and equipment in a safe and efficient manner. A milking machine in a barn setting provides various benefits for both the farmer and the animals. First and foremost, it speeds up the milking process and helps maintain consistent milking schedules, thereby increasing productivity. Furthermore, the device ensures hygiene since the milk is extracted in a sterilized closed system, reducing the chance of contamination and improving the overall milk quality. On the other hand, an industrial area usually refers to a designated zone where large-scale production, manufacturing, or processing of goods takes place. Industrial dairy farms or processing plants install milking machines to handle large numbers of animals and to streamline the milk production process. In these settings, milking machines are often part of a more extensive automated system and may include additional components such as conveyor belts, rotary parlors, or automated feeding systems for efficient milk production. It is highly unlikely that a milking machine would be located in an office or a bar, as these are places designed for human interaction and activities, quite unrelated to dairy production. Offices cater to administrative and management tasks while bars are social establishments serving beverages and sometimes food. Lastly, while it is not common to find an actively used milking machine in a museum, it is possible to encounter antique or historical displays of early milking machines or dairy farming equipment in agricultural museums or history exhibits. These displays aim to educate visitors about the evolution of the dairy industry and advancements in technology. In conclusion, the best answer is that a milking machine may be located either in a barn or an industrial area, as these settings cater to the functionality and utility required for efficient milk extraction and production."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

In 1895, members of the Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers reenacted their famous stand at Rorke's Drift, 18 years earlier. 25 British soldiers beat back the attack of 75 Zulus at the Grand Military Fete at the Cheltenham Winter Gardens. Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett's Charge. During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol  , the Battle of Borodino  in St Petersburg and the Taking of Azov  in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 Storming of the Winter Palace on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World. Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, an important military engagement of the Nine Years' War, was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show.

Answer: S76 Question: what type of batteries are 357 (LR44) Answer:","output":"The LR44 battery, also known as the 357 battery, is a type of small, alkaline, button/coin cell battery primarily used in small electronic devices like watches, calculators, laser pointers, and hearing aids. LR44 batteries are widely available and easy to replace in most devices. The LR44 is not the only designation for this battery; it has several other names and model numbers used by different manufacturers, which can cause confusion among consumers. Those names include AG13, G13-A, S76, SR44W, GP76A, V13GA, PX76A, and L1154. However, these batteries typically have similar specifications and are interchangeable in most cases. The \\"LR\\" in \\"LR44\\" stands for \\"Alkaline Round,\\" while the \\"44\\" is the battery's size code. Their chemistry is alkaline, which means they use an alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide, and have a zinc anode and manganese dioxide cathode. LR44 batteries have a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts and an average capacity of 130 to 150 milliamp-hours (mAh). They have a longer life than silver oxide batteries but may have a lower voltage, which can affect the performance of some devices. The S76 battery, on the other hand, is a silver oxide battery. Silver oxide batteries are similar in size and shape to their alkaline LR44 counterparts, but they have a different chemical composition. As a result, the S76 battery also has a nominal voltage of 1.55 volts and a slightly higher capacity than the LR44, boasting 170 to 200 mAh. Silver oxide batteries like the S76 are known for being more stable, maintaining consistent voltage output throughout their lifespan. They also have better leakage resistance and temperature tolerance, making them superior choices for applications that demand precise voltage or can be negatively impacted by voltage dips, such as in watches and medical devices. In conclusion, while the S76 and 357 (LR44) batteries may be similar in terms of size and physical appearance, they are not identical in terms of their chemical composition and performance characteristics. Therefore, the answer to the question, \\"are the LR44 (357) batteries S76 type?\\" is no. The LR44 (357) batteries are alkaline, while the S76 batteries are silver oxide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Additionally, birds living in arid environments often develop a deep understanding of the local flora and fauna in their quest to quench their thirst. Many plants and cacti store water in their tissues, and some even bear fruits that are high in water content. Birds can use their beaks to penetrate these sources of water and consume them, gaining both nutrition and hydration in the process. For example, some birds may rely on water-rich fruits such as melons or cacti like the barrel cactus, which store water to survive prolonged dry periods. Moreover, these resourceful birds also observe the behavior of other animals living in the same environment to locate water. For instance, they may follow larger fauna that are known to have well-developed water-finding instincts, such as antelopes, elephants, or camels. Birds can also look for animal tracks or listen for specific sounds that indicate the presence of water, such as the buzzing of insects or the splashing of birds bathing in a hidden water source. Lastly, some birds in arid regions have evolved to prioritize metabolic water production – the process whereby water is generated as a byproduct of their own metabolism, particularly during the digestion of food. Due to this biological adaptation, they can thrive on a diet of insects, seeds, and other dry food sources, and reduce their dependency on external water sources. In conclusion, a bird living in an arid place can find water if it adopts several strategies, including locating condensed dew, targeting water-rich plants and fruits, observing the behavior of other animals, and relying on metabolic water production. These remarkable adaptations highlight the incredible resilience and resourcefulness of birds inhabiting some of the harshest environments on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grammatical Structure: The Russian sentence retains the structure of the source text, although some modifications have been made to suit Russian grammar. For example, the adjective \\"глупость\\" (stupidity) is in the accusative case and agrees with the plural noun \\"людей\\" (people), while \\"предложение\\" (proposition) is also in the accusative case, as it is the object of the verb \\"принимать\\" (to take).

What is the best way to: How do you coat cake pop in chocolate?","output":"To coat cake pops in chocolate, follow these step-by-step instructions and justifications: 1. Prepare the chocolate coating: Choose a high-quality chocolate or candy melts for the coating. It's essential to pick a good-quality chocolate or candy melts to ensure a smooth and even coating on the cake pops.  2. Chop the chocolate: If using chocolate, chop it into small, uniform pieces to ensure even melting. Smaller pieces will melt more consistently at the same rate, reducing the chance of burning or seizing the chocolate. 3. Melt the chocolate: Using a double boiler or microwave, melt the chocolate until it is smooth and glossy. Make sure to stir the chocolate or candy melts frequently, as this will help ensure even melting and prevent overheating.    - If using a double boiler, fill the bottom pan with water, and place the chocolate in the top pan. Heat the water (without boiling), and let the chocolate melt by the steam's heat. Stir often.       - If using a microwave, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 20-30 second intervals, stirring frequently to avoid overheating. 4. Thin the chocolate: If the melted chocolate is too thick to coat the cake pops evenly, add a small amount of paramount crystals, shortening, or coconut oil to thin the consistency. Adding too much will cause the coating to become greasy, so start with a little and add more if necessary. 5. Prepare the cake pops: Make sure the cake pops are chilled and firm before starting the coating process. This helps to prevent the cake pops from falling off the sticks or leaving crumbs in the chocolate. 6. Dip the tip of the cake pop stick into the chocolate: This acts as \\"glue\\" and helps to secure the cake pop onto the stick. Insert the dipped stick into the cake pop about halfway through, and then let the chocolate set before dipping the cake pop. 7. Dip the cake pop into the chocolate: Hold the cake pop by the stick and submerge it into the melted chocolate until it is completely coated. Gently tap the stick against the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate and create a smooth surface. 8. Decorate (optional): If you wish to add sprinkles, crushed nuts, or other decorations to the cake pop, do so immediately after dipping the cake pop in the chocolate, while the chocolate is still wet. 9. Set the cake pop: Place the coated cake pop into a cake pop stand or a piece of styrofoam to hold it upright. Allow the chocolate to set and harden at room temperature or in the refrigerator. 10. Store the cake pops: Once the chocolate has set, you can store the cake pops in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room temperature, depending on the type of chocolate used and the filling ingredients. By following these steps, you'll be able to coat cake pops in chocolate uniformly, resulting in an attractive and delicious treat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's Seinfeld. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally.  On the \\"Notes About Nothing\\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \\"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\\"  Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London?, using the article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

Which former British politician died on 8th April 2013 aged 87?","output":"The former British politician who died on 8th April 2013 at the age of 87 was Margaret Thatcher, also known as the \\"Iron Lady.\\" Born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, Margaret Hilda Thatcher (née Roberts) went on to become one of the most significant figures in the United Kingdom's political history.  Thatcher was the first and, to date, the only woman to serve as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, holding office from 1979 to 1990. She was also the leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990.  Her political career began when she was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Thatcher held various positions within the Conservative Party, eventually becoming the Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1970 in the government of Edward Heath. In 1975, Thatcher successfully challenged Heath for the Conservative Party leadership and became the leader of the party. As the Prime Minister, Thatcher was famous for her strong conservative policies, which were hallmarked by economic liberalization, privatization of state-owned industries, and deregulation. She pursued monetarist policies to control inflation and reduced the power of trade unions. Her policies were aimed at fostering individualism and self-reliance among British citizens. Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister was marked by several significant events, including the Falklands War (1982) against Argentina, a conflict that resulted in the recapture of the Falkland Islands and bolstered Thatcher's popularity in the United Kingdom. She also established a close relationship with the United States under President Ronald Reagan, sharing similar conservative political views and forging a strong partnership during the Cold War. Thatcher was eventually ousted from power in 1990 when her authority within the Conservative Party began to falter. After her resignation, she undertook various roles, including that of a global speaker, author, and member of the House of Lords with the title of Baroness Thatcher. Towards the end of her life, Thatcher's health deteriorated; she suffered from several minor strokes in the early 2000s and was diagnosed with dementia. She passed away on April 8, 2013, due to a stroke while staying at the Ritz Hotel in London. Margaret Thatcher remains a divisive figure in British politics, with her supporters praising her for reviving the country's economy and playing a significant role during the Cold War, while her detractors criticize the social divisions and inequalities that emerged during her time in office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: When it comes to the new \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" movie, critics have found one begrudging silver lining: At least it's better than \\"Transformers.\\" Of course the live-action \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\\" in theaters Friday, has some things in common with that toy-based franchise, beginning with its association with Michael Bay. The \\"Transformers\\" director served as a producer on 2014's \\"Turtles\\" adaptation -- leaving the directing to Jonathan Liebesman of \\"Battle Los Angeles\\" -- and tapped former \\"Transformers\\" star Megan Fox to go along for the ride. In \\"Turtles,\\" Fox plays April O'Neil, the eager NYC TV reporter who stumbles across the titular crew of teenage mutants who are well-versed in the martial arts. As April learns, this quad of wise-cracking reptiles, who have a fondness for pizza and a rat for a mentor, are the result of a lab experiment. So there's the first sigh of relief for longtime fans of \\"turtle power\\": the new \\"Turtles\\" backstory is pretty faithful to the legacy of the comics, animated series and movies that came before it. There's a tweak involving April's childhood relationship to the turtles, but, overall, Donatello's still the brainy one; Raphael's still the hothead; Leonardo's still the leader; and Michelangelo is as party-ready as ever. The problem, critics say, isn't that Bay, Liebesman and script writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty didn't respect the lore, or that the movie doesn't deliver on action. It's that they revived the franchise with no sense of humor or affection, or even a clear understanding of their audience. \\"The new adaptation,\\" says the Los Angeles Times, \\"often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management. There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could.\\" It's not \\"out-and-out terrible,\\" but it's not \\"particularly memorable,\\" either. Variety wound up in the same place of ambivalence, remarking in its review that \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" is a \\"back-to-basics origin saga that is neither a particularly good movie nor the pop culture travesty that some were dreading.\\" There are all the usual Bay trademarks -- \\"chaotic action, crass side jokes, visual-effects overkill, Megan Fox\\" -- but on the other hand, it's also \\"nowhere near 'Transformers'-level off-putting,\\" Variety shrugs.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that has their name changed in Denise Waverly? is inside the article: The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.  Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups., can you guess it ?

For now, we are classifying them as an unexplained but non-threatening phenomenon.\\" Meredith listened intently, noting how the audience reacted to Dr. Wells' words. As a fellow medical professional, her main concern was understanding these new growths and ensuring the best possible care for patients presenting with them. Dr. Wells continued, \\"With the patient's consent, our team has conducted extensive testing and analysis, including biopsies of the growth to further understand its composition and numerous imaging studies for a more comprehensive view. We've found that the growths seem to be composed of human tissue, possessing a mix of epidermal, connective, and even some nervous tissue components. In that sense, they appear to be similar to teratomas - benign tumors that often proliferate from embryonic cells.\\" Meredith considered this information. While it was reassuring to know that the growths were benign, their sudden and widespread appearance remained puzzling. Dr. Wells continued to address the crowd, delving into more specifics. \\"One aspect that we find unusual is the accelerated growth rate of these growths. They seem to grow rapidly within a short period, with some patients reporting growths that appeared in just a matter of weeks. Moreover, they appear to be painless and unresponsive to external stimuli. At this stage, we believe that there is no indication of contagiousness or transmissibility.\\" As the presentation proceeded, Meredith found herself even more captivated by the new information that Dr. Wells was sharing. It was concerning that despite several weeks, the root cause of the growths had remained elusive, evading the scrutiny of even the most brilliant medical minds. This propelled her to engage in this research initiative fully. \\"With collaboration from multiple institutions and excellent interdisciplinary communication, our efforts continue to identify potential causes, risk factors, and potential treatment or management options for patients with these growths. Though our understanding is limited, we are hopeful that further research will uncover the crucial insights needed to address this medical anomaly,\\" Dr. Wells concluded. The audience, brimming with questions, gradually began discussing amongst themselves while others approached Dr. Wells to seek more information. Meredith, equally perplexed and intrigued, decided to focus her energy on this pressing issue. She knew that the answer must lie somewhere within their collective intellect and experience, and she resolved to become an active participant in unraveling the mystery of these unexplained growths. Meredith joined the research initiative alongside Dr. Wells and other experts from around the world. They shared ideas, conducted experiments, and analyzed data at a rapid pace. As they delved further into the unknown, the world watched on with bated breath, waiting for a breakthrough in understanding and addressing these strange new growths. Despite the difficulty of the task ahead, Meredith remained optimistic in the power of scientific collaboration and determination, knowing that her work was crucial not only for the patients but also for the broader community. As each discovery and milestone brought them closer to understanding the puzzling phenomenon, the medical world eagerly anticipated the day when they could provide definitive answers and effective treatments."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Problem:turn opposite right twice after run twice Solution:","output":"To solve this, we need to break down the command into actions and follow the instructions accordingly: 1. The command says 'after run twice', which tells us to first perform the action I_RUN twice.    - I_RUN    - I_RUN 2. The command then moves to 'turn opposite right twice'. The word 'opposite' indicates that we need to turn backward in the specified direction. So to turn backward right, we first turn left (I_TURN_LEFT). Since it's mentioned 'twice', we need to do this action two times.    - I_TURN_LEFT    - I_TURN_LEFT The correct sequence of actions to execute the given command would be: - I_RUN - I_RUN - I_TURN_LEFT - I_TURN_LEFT"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Nonverbal  Communication When you are in another country, it is important to know the language, but it is equally important to know how to communicate nonverbally. Before saying anything, people communicate nonverbally by making gestures. According to an investigation ,only 30 to 35 percent of our communication is verbal. When people don't know the language, the most common way to communicate is through gestures. However, many gestures have different meanings, or no meaning at all, in different parts of the world. In the United States, for example, nodding your head up and down means \\"yes\\". In some parts of Greece and Turkey, however, this motion can mean \\"no\\". In Southeast Asia, nodding your head is a polite way of saying \\"I've heard you.\\" In ancient Rome, when the emperor wanted to spare someone's life, he would put his thumb up. Today in the United States, when someone puts his/her thumb up, it means \\"Everything is all right.\\" However, in Sardinia and Greece, the gesture is insulting  and should not be used there. In the United States, raising your clasped  hands above your head means \\"I'm the champion\\" or \\"I'm the winner\\". It is the sign that prizefighters make when they win a fight. When a leading Russian statesman  made this gesture after a White House meeting, Americans misunderstood and thought he meant he was a winner. In Russia, however, it is a sign of friendship. There are other nonverbal signals that people should be aware of when they go to another country, such as the distance to maintain between speakers. Americans stand closer to each other than English people. English people don't like touching somebody or being touched. Now in America, touch is important. For example friends touch each other on the arm. They often put an arm around a friend when they say \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\".

There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-, and gamma radiation.  - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - Red is the color at the longer-wavelengths end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange, at the opposite end from violet. Red color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620740 nanometers. Light with a longer wavelength than red but shorter than terahertz radiation and microwave is called infrared.  - Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between and . This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands, and various sources use different boundaries. In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often restricting the range between 1 and 100 GHz (300 and 3 mm). Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, K, K, or K band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - The human eye is an organ which reacts to light and pressure. As a sense organ, the mammalian eye allows vision. Human eyes help provide a three dimensional, moving image, normally coloured in daylight. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon.  - Johannes (Janne) Robert Rydberg (8 November 1854  28 December 1919) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula, in 1888, which is used to predict the wavelengths of photons (of light and other electromagnetic radiation) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom.  - A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen. The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the elemental (baryonic) mass of the universe.  - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.  - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons.  - Johannes ( Janne ) Robert Rydberg ( November 8 , 1854 -- December 28 , 1919 ) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula , in 1888 , which is used to predict the wavelengths of photons ( of light and other electromagnetic radiation ) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom . The physical constant known as the Rydberg constant is named after him , as is the Rydberg unit . Excited atoms with very high values of the principal quantum number , represented by n in the Rydberg formula , are called Rydberg atoms . Rydberg 's anticipation that spectral studies could assist in a theoretical understanding of the atom and its chemical properties was justified in 1913 by the work of Niels Bohr ( see hydrogen spectrum ) . An important spectroscopic constant based on a hypothetical atom of infinite mass is called the Rydberg ( R ) in his honour . He was active at Lund University , Sweden , for all of his working life . The crater Rydberg on the Moon and asteroid 10506 Rydberg are named in his honour . There is a pub night held in Rydberg 's honour every Wednesday at the Department of Physics at Lund University .  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle that states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: \\"n\\", the principal quantum number, ', the angular momentum quantum number, \\"m\\", the magnetic quantum number, and \\"m\\", the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their \\"n\\", ', and \\"m\\" values are the same, then their \\"m\\" must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spins of 1/2 and -1/2. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin-statistics theorem of 1940.  - Infrared radiation, or simply infrared or IR, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore invisible, although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light. It extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz), to 1000000 nm (300 GHz) (although people can see infrared up to at least 1050 nm in experiments). Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared. Like all EMR, IR carries radiant energy, and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle, the photon.   - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - Ultraviolet (UV) is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 nm (30 PHz) to 400 nm (750 THz), shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation constitutes about 10% of the total light output of the Sun, and is thus present in sunlight. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although it is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.  - The Rydberg formula is used in atomic physics to describe the wavelengths of spectral lines of many chemical elements. It was formulated by the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg, and presented on 5 November 1888.

Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which century plant species in northeast Michigan  were in less stress, sixteenth century or twentieth century?  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the sixteenth century, plant species in northeast Michigan were in less stress compared to the twentieth century.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person given the appointment of Professor at the Conservatoire? , can you please find it?   It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

If you just put them here and there after playing, it would be hard to find them when you want them again, right? The same thing applies to books. Books are like magical doors to different worlds. From dragons and knights to talking animals and mystical lands, each book has a story to tell. But when we are not reading them, they need a proper place just like your toys. That's where a bookshelf comes in! But you know what? We can't just put books on the shelf any old way. We need a smart system. First, we need to make sure all our books stand upright, kind of like soldiers standing in a line. Just imagine if your books are like little people. They need to stand on their feet, right? Placing books upright helps them stay in good shape so they can take us on many more adventures! Next, we need to group our books according to their size - just like when we pair big teddy with big truck and tiny doll with tiny teacup. This makes each shelf on our bookshelf look neat and tidy, and also keeps our smaller books from getting squished by bigger ones. Put all the tall, big books together, and then the short little ones. That also makes it easier for your small hands to reach for smaller books. Last but not least, it's important to space our books carefully. This means not squishing them together too tight or leaving too much space between them. Books needs some space to breathe, just like you need some space when you're sleeping. Can you imagine being squished between two giants or feeling lost in a huge field? You won't feel comfortable, right? The same goes with our books.  So, the next time you put your books away, remember to place them upright, group them according to size, and give them enough space to breathe.

One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti (Georgian: - ) is a region (Mkhare) in western Georgia which includes the historical Georgian provinces of Samegrelo (Mingrelia) and Zemo Svaneti (i.e., Upper Svaneti) and has Zugdidi as its capital.

Born in Khoni , Georgia ( then part of the Russian Empire ) , he graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1931 and attended the 1st Congress of the USSR Union of Writers , 1934 , when socialist realism was laid down as the cultural orthodoxy . From 1953 to 1967 , he chaired the Union of Georgian Writers . In 1970 , he also became a vice-president of the Georgian Academy of Sciences . In 1960 he organized an expedition to the Georgian - built Monastery of the Cross at Jerusalem where his team rediscovered a fresco of Shota Rustaveli , a medieval Georgian poet . He chaired the special academic commission for the Rustaveli studies since 1963 and became the founder and an editor - in - chief of The Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia in 1967 . His poems are viewed as classical works of Georgian literature . His poetry was mostly patriotic based on Georgian cultural and religious values , but normally loyal to Soviet ideogy . He welcomed Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika and supported the Soviet - era dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia when he came to power and led Georgia to the declaration of independence in 1991 . Abashidze died in Tbilisi in 1992 and was afforded a state funeral . He was 82 .  - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\";  , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769  5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.  - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.  - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - Tbilisi, commonly known by its former name Tiflis, and often mispronounced as \\"Tiblisi\\", is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of roughly 1.5 million inhabitants. Founded in the 5th century by the monarch of Georgia's ancient precursor the Kingdom of Iberia, Tbilisi has since served, with intermissions, as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Under Russian rule, from 1801 to 1917 Tiflis was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy governing both sides of the entire Caucasus.  - Khoni is a town in the Western Georgian region (mkhare) of Imereti with the population of 23.600 (2014 Georgia census).

How do gay men react to yaoi manga which are usually popular with straight women? What do gay men typically think about yaoi? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"In order to answer these questions, I will first gather information by researching online forums, social media, and articles that discuss the perspectives of gay men on yaoi manga. After that, I will provide a balanced perspective considering various views. Step 1: Research the topic on various platforms. - I will search for online forums and communities where gay men discuss their opinions on yaoi manga, such as Reddit r/gaymers and r/LGBT. - I will also browse social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to identify the sentiment towards yaoi among gay men. - Lastly, I will look for articles and blog posts that provide insights or opinions from gay men regarding yaoi manga. Step 2: Analyze the gathered information - I will carefully analyze the gathered information, taking note of any recurring opinions or common criticisms. I will ensure to address both positive and negative views on the subject. Step 3: Summarize the findings Based on my research, opinions of gay men on yaoi manga vary. Some gay men enjoy yaoi manga and appreciate the fact that it celebrates same-sex relationships. They may find it entertaining and relatable to their own experiences as a form of escapism. However, other gay men might not appreciate yaoi manga due to its portrayal of same-sex relationships, which is often created by and for straight women. It can reinforce harmful stereotypes or misrepresent what it means to be gay, as it is sometimes highly fantasized and might not be an accurate representation of the struggles or experiences of real gay men. Now, to answer if these questions are the same: The first question asks for a reaction of gay men to yaoi manga, which means how they feel about it when they come across yaoi. The second question is about what gay men think of yaoi in general, which could encompass not just a reaction, but also a deeper understanding of their stance toward yaoi, whether positive, negative, or neutral.

The letters read, in part: \\"To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\"      They were signed \\"I am KC and I approve this message,\\" a source told CNN.      They each had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.

Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing \\"a suspicious granular substance\\" to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi.      The FBI said the substance tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote.

(Associated Press)      Everett Dutschke, whose Tupelo, Miss., home was searched Tuesday by dozens of officials, some in hazmat suits, had feuded with Paul Kevin Curtis, a 45-year-old celebrity impersonator who had maintained his innocence since his arrest.      The search began early Tuesday afternoon and ended about 11 p.m. CDT, with officials declining to comment on what they had found or on the next phase of the investigation.      At one point, two FBI agents and two members of the state's chemical response team left Dutschke's property and began combing through ditches, culverts and woods about a block away from his house in the neighborhood of single-family detached homes.      Dutschke, who spoke with The Associated Press by telephone during the search, said his house was also searched last week.      \\"I don't know how much more of this I can take,\\" he said.      No charges have been filed against Dutschke and he hasn't been arrested. Both he and Curtis, who had faced charges in the case, say they have no idea how to make the poisonous ricin and had nothing to do with sending the letters to President Barack Obama, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and a state judge.      Referring to investigators' questions for him about the case, Curtis said after he was released from custody Tuesday afternoon, \\"I thought they said rice and I said, 'I don't even eat rice.' ... I respect President Obama. I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to him or any other U.S. official.\\"      A one-sentence document filed by federal prosecutors said charges against Curtis were dropped, but left open the possibility they could be reinstated if authorities found more to prove their case. Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.      Since Curtis' arrest at his Corinth, Miss., home on April 17, his attorneys have said their client didn't do it and suggested he was framed. An FBI agent testified in court this week that no evidence of ricin was found in searches of Curtis' home.      The dismissal is the latest twist in a case that has been strange from the beginning and rattled the country during the same week as the Boston Marathon bombing and a fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.      Dutschke (DUHST'-kee) and Curtis are no strangers to each other. Dutschke said the two had a disagreement and the last contact they had was in 2010. Dutschke said he threatened to sue Curtis for saying he was a member of Mensa, a group for people with high IQs.      Hal Neilson, an attorney for Curtis, said the defense gave authorities a list of people who may have had a reason to hurt Curtis.      \\"Dutschke came up,\\" he said. \\"They (prosecutors) took it and ran with it. I could not tell you if he's the man or he's not the man, but there was something there they wanted to look into.\\"      An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said the two ricin-laced letters addressed to Obama and Wicker said: \\"To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\" Both were signed, \\"I am KC and I approve this message.\\"      Curtis was already well known to Wicker because he had written to the Republican senator and other officials. Curtis also wrote a novel called \\"Missing Pieces,\\" about black-market body parts he claimed to have found while working at a hospital _ a claim the hospital says is untrue. Curtis posted similar language on his Facebook page and elsewhere. The documents indicate Curtis had been distrustful of the government for years. He told the AP on Tuesday that he realizes his writings made him an easy target.      Multiple online posts under the name Kevin Curtis on various websites that could be seen by anyone refer to the conspiracy he claimed to uncover when working at a local hospital from 1998 to 2000. In one post, Curtis said he sent letters to Wicker and other politicians. He signed off: \\"This is Kevin Curtis & I approve this message.\\"      Christi McCoy, another attorney for Curtis, said she doesn't know what new information prosecutors have, but said the plot to frame her client was \\"very, very diabolical.\\"      Curtis, dressed after his release Tuesday in a black suit, red shirt, necktie and sunglasses, said he met Dutschke in 2005 but that for some reason Dutschke \\"hated\\" and \\"stalked\\" him. \\"To this day I have no clue of why he hates me.\\"      Ricin is derived from the castor plant that makes castor oil. There is no antidote and it is at its deadliest when inhaled. It can be aerosolized, released into the air and inhaled. The Homeland Security handbook says the amount of ricin that fits on the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult if properly prepared.      Dutschke said agents asked him about Curtis, whether Dutschke would take a lie-detector test and if he had ever bought castor beans, which can be used to make the potent poison.      \\"I'm a patriotic American. I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letters,\\" said Dutschke, who was a Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2007 but lost.      After charges were dropped against Curtis, he said: \\"I'm a little shocked.\\"      Dutschke said his attorney wasn't with him and he didn't know whether he was going to be arrested.      Tuesday's events began when the third day of a preliminary and detention hearing was canceled without officials explaining the change. Within two hours, Curtis had been released, though it wasn't clear why at first.      FBI Agent Brandon Grant said in court Monday that searches last week of Curtis' vehicle and house in Corinth, found no ricin, ingredients for the poison, or devices used to make it. A search of Curtis' computers found no evidence he researched making ricin. Authorities produced no other physical evidence at the hearings tying Curtis to the letters.      All the envelopes and stamps were self-adhesive, Grant said Monday, meaning they won't yield DNA evidence. One fingerprint was found on the letter sent to a Lee County judge, but the FBI doesn't know who it belongs to, Grant said.      The experience, Curtis said, has been a nightmare for his family. He has four children _ ages, 8, 16, 18 and 20. It also has made him reflect deeply on his life.      \\"I've become closer to God through all this, closer with my children and I've even had some strained relationships with some family and cousins and this has brought us closer as a family,\\" he said.      ___      Wagster Pettus reported from Jackson.

Roberts gives us incredibly complex characters, finely drawn, whose lives and issues pull the reader in and keep them until the last page. The main characters, Mila, her husband- then ex-husband- David, and the mysterious Diaz are all fascinating. When we find Mila and David divorced after the theft of their infant son, we readers have no idea that we will go on a roller coaster ride with Mila as she works through this difficult emotional loss as well as becomes a different person, one capable of dealing with kidnappers and murderers.I bought this book and kkept it, read it twice and found some new things in the second reading. I found it to be one of Roberts' best, and a marvelous read. Hankies, yes for some. Not me.

James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb?  Hint: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. The answer to this question is:","output":"the vapor light. According to the information provided, vapor lights, including sodium and mercury vapor lights, are very bright and energy efficient. They also have the added benefit of being long lasting.  To justify the step, let's understand how both types of lights work: 1. Traditional incandescent light bulbs work by heating a tiny metal filament to create light, which makes them less energy efficient as they waste a lot of energy in the form of heat. 2. On the other hand, vapor lights, as described in the paragraph, work by electroluminescence. They involve an electric current passing through a gas, which causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. This is a more energy-efficient process than in traditional bulbs. So, given the choice between a vapor light and a regular light bulb, it's clear that the more energy-efficient option is the vapor light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: How Often Do Most Couples Have Sex?            As a sexual health doctor, this is the number one question I hear. But it’s not the whole story.      By Dr. Harry Fisch            The number one question I’m asked about sex: how often is normal?      The average man has eleven erections every day (including partial erections). Teenage boys and men in their twenties with high hormonal levels might think it’s totally normal to have sex several times a day. But in my experience, I’d say that the typical average is two to three times a week. That was also the figure in the American Sexual Behavior Study, a 2006 survey reporting that the average frequency of sex for married couples went from about once every two-three days for couples between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine, to about twice a week for couples between 30 and 50, and less than once a week for older couples.      Couples of any age in the early phase of a love relationship tend to have a lot of sex—daily if not more frequently. But the frequency of sex declines as any relationship ages, although married couples have more sex than those who are single. Obviously, regular access to sex makes it more likely to happen!      Remember, these are averages. Some couples are happy with more frequent sex, some happy with less frequent sex. If you only feel like having sex once or twice a week but find those encounters deeply satisfying, that’s normal for you and that’s totally fine. Not wanting any sex at all is not.      And that’s really the point: not how much sex you’re having, but whether you and your partner are happy with the sex you are having. Quality wins out over quantity every time. It’s all about the satisfaction.      That said, quality sex isn’t just about frequency. It’s also about the length of the sex act.      There have been studies in which couples consented to be scientifically observed having sex, and one of the observers timed each session with a stopwatch to make a fairly accurate assessment about the length of the coupling. Not surprisingly, there is an extremely large variation in the time it takes a couple to have sex, ranging from the excessively short (about two minutes or less, which famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey dryly noted was a “frequent source of marital conflict”) to the “Are you done yet?” (over forty minutes).      An astonishing 45 percent of men finish the sex act too quickly, which is to say, within Kinsey’s conflicted two minutes. That’s pretty speedy. Way too speedy for the average woman to be able to have an orgasm through vaginal penetration alone. At least five minutes, and more like seven, is usually what’s needed for a woman to be able to achieve orgasm.      And even though the average length of the average inter-vaginal sex session is about 7.3 minutes, that’s still not particularly long, especially for women who usually take much longer than men to become aroused enough to have an orgasm.      So if your man is done within two minutes of things getting hot and heavy—or still not done 40 minutes later—you may want to gently broach the idea of getting a medical checkup to make sure everything’s functioning correctly. And don’t worry: As I discuss in The New Naked, if 7.3 minutes doesn’t seem like enough time for you to get the satisfaction you need, you and your partner can learn to express what you do need or want, so you both can be happy in bed and out.

Further, participants reported the duration of foreplay and intercourse that they felt most men and most women wanted. Ideal length of foreplay did not differ for men and women. However, men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did their partners. The ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were significantly longer than the actual duration for both genders. The women, but not the men, significantly underestimated their partners' desired duration of foreplay and intercourse. Further, both genders exhibited faulty stereotypes concerning men's but not women's ideal scripts. Men were seen as desiring a significantly shorter duration of foreplay and intercourse than the ideal reported by the men in the study. Both men's and women's perceptions of their partners' ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were found to be more strongly related to their own sexual stereotypes than to their partners' self-reported sexual desires, suggesting that people rely on sexual stereotypes when estimating their partners' ideal sexual scripts. Men's and women's ideal scripts and men's and women's sexual stereotypes concerning the opposite gender's ideal duration of foreplay were found to uniquely predict the foreplay performance script. For intercourse, men's and women's ideal scripts and men's stereotypes concerning the duration of intercourse that women want uniquely predicated the performance script. We present potential reasons for the discrepancy in individuals' performance and ideal scripts. ||||| In a piece on Nerve.com, Harry Fisch, author of the new book The New Naked: The Ultimate Sex Education for Grown-Ups, reports that “an astonishing 45 percent of men finish the sex act too quickly.” How quickly? Within two minutes, according to Fisch. This would seem to be bad news for those men's partners and good news for the posthumous reputation of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, whose research in the 1940s and 1950s concluded that three-quarters of men usually ejaculated within two minutes.      Before you conclude that Fisch's data simply represents more evidence of a male-dominated society's inherent pleasure inequality, it's worth noting that more recent scholars have looked into the question of what the different sexes actually think about it. As it happens, men may be more bothered by it than women. For a 2004 paper in the Journal of Sex Research, University of New Brunswick researchers S. Andrea Miller and E. Sandra Byers interviewed 152 heterosexual couples on their “actual and desired duration of foreplay and of intercourse.” Their subjects spanned a wide range of ages—21 to 77 years old—and relationship type—from 6-month to 50-year partnerships. Miller and Byers found that men reported a much longer ideal duration than did their partners.      It's true that for both sexes, the “ideal” length of both foreplay and intercourse was much longer than the actual. But the New Brunswick results at least suggest that the men are not happy with this status quo.      Fisch also points out that two minutes is “way too speedy for the average woman to be able to have an orgasm through vaginal penetration alone.” But an even older piece of research suggests that link might not be quite so clear. In a 1951 paper in the Journal of Psychology, “Correlates of orgasm adequacy in a group of 556 wives,” psychologist Lewis Terman found no significant correlation between intercourse duration and female “orgasm adequacy.” Alas, the concept of speed has not fared as well in more recent research. In a 2009 paper in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, Czech psychologists Petr Weiss and Stuart Brody found, based on surveys with 2,360 Czech women, that women’s chance of having an orgasm was much more highly correlated with duration of sex than of foreplay. ||||| Where do men last the longest?

Spreadsheets, an app which measures the 'duration, thrusts, and decibel peak' of a couple's sexual rhythm, looked at the statistics of 10,000 of its users (map courtesy of Nerve)      According to the 2009 study Canadian and American Sex Therapists' Perceptions of Normal and Abnormal Ejaculatory Latencies: How Long Should Intercourse Last?, intercourse lasts anywhere from three to seven minutes on average.            'Very few people have intercourse per se [Latin for by thrust] that goes longer than 12 minutes,' explained sex therapist Barry W. McCarthy, adding that premature ejaculation refers to intercourse that lasts less than a minute or two.            'Very few people have intercourse that goes longer than 12 minutes'      The Spreadsheets app, which launched in August last year, aims to help couples measure their pleasure using the accelerometer and microphone in their smartphone to time how long sex lasts, while monitoring both the speed and 'thrust' frequency, as well as the amount of noise created during sex.            Users can unlock 30 'achievements ' while using the app, which is a points system enabling couples to set challenges for themselves.            A session of early morning sex gets ten points, while a lazy Sunday session earns 20, for example.

Study leader Dr. Antonio Pastore of the Sapienza University of Rome said the study involved a group of 40 men ages 19 to 46 who had premature ejaculation -- defined as “ejaculation within a minute,\\" who had tried a variety of therapies, without any significant improvement.      During the 12-week study period, the men were trained to exercise their pelvic floor muscles and their time-to-orgasm was measured.      The study, presented at the European Congress of Urology in Stockholm, found at the start of the trial the average ejaculation time was 31.7 seconds, but by the end of the 12-weeks of pelvic floor exercises this had risen to 146.2 seconds -- a more than four-fold increase.      “      This is a small study, so the effects need to be verified in a bigger trial. Nevertheless, the results are very positive. The rehabilitation exercises are easy to perform, with no reported adverse effects,\\" Pastore said in a statement. \\"Previously the men in the trial had tried a variety of treatments, including creams, behavioral therapy, antidepressants and psychological treatments -- with little success. However, we found that 33 of the 40 men in our trial improved their ejaculation time within 12 weeks. We also found that the fact that the men were able to improve their sex-lives through their own efforts helped their self-confidence.\\"      [European Congress of Urology] |||||","output":"This article provides insights into the average frequency of sexual intercourse for couples and the importance of quality over quantity. According to the data cited by Dr. Harry Fisch, the average frequency of sex for couples varies based on their age, with younger couples (eighteen to twenty-nine years old) having sex about once every two-three days, those between thirty and fifty engaging about twice a week and older couples having sex less than once a week. Relationship longevity also affects frequency, with newer couples having more sex than those who have been together longer.  Beyond frequency, the article addresses the length of sexual intercourse and orgasm satisfaction. Dr. Fisch claims that an astonishing 45 percent of men may finish too quickly (within two minutes), often too soon for a woman to achieve orgasm. Many women take longer than men to become aroused enough to orgasm, typically needing at least five to seven minutes.  Another study detailed in the article reports on the perceived pleasure inequality between men and women. It found that men may be more bothered than women about their performance time. Men reported a longer \\"ideal\\" duration than their partners, which suggests dissatisfaction with the status quo.  The piece also provides information from an app measuring the duration, thrusts, and decibel peak of a couple's sexual rhythm. This data presents an overview of the average intercourse time across different states in the US, indicating a wide range.  Lastly, the article presents some treatment options for men suffering from premature ejaculation, such as a 12-week pelvic floor exercises program. The program was found to increase the ejaculation time from an average of 31.7 seconds to 146.2 seconds, demonstrating a more than four-fold increase, and helping improve self-confidence. The findings need to be validated in larger studies.  These statistics and studies highlight that what is average or ideal varies widely among individuals and couples, and what matters most is their sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, not the absolute numbers or comparisons with others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Exhibitions      The Soap Lady      The Soap Lady is the name given to a woman whose body was exhumed in Philadelphia in 1875. The specimen is unique because a fatty substance called adipocere encases the remains. Adipocere formation is not common, but it may form in alkaline, warm, airless environments, such as the one in which the Soap Lady was buried.      The first X-rays taken of the Soap Lady in 1986 revealed buttons and pins on her clothing that that were not manufactured in the United States until the 1830s.      Dr. Joseph Leidy, known as the father of American vertebrate paleontology, procured the body of the Soap Lady after she was exhumed at a Philadelphia cemetery. He originally reported that she died in the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of the 1790s. Based on her lack of teeth, Leidy assumed that she had died in middle or old age.      The first X-rays taken of the Soap Lady in 1987 revealed buttons and pins on her clothing that that were not manufactured in the United States until the 1830s. Leidy was wrong about her year of death.      A radiology team from Quinnipiac University led by Jerry Conlogue and Ron Beckett made a new set of digital and print X-rays in 2007. These images have allowed us to revise the Soap Lady’s age at death from about 40 to significantly younger, perhaps in her late 20s. ||||| FILE – This July 12, 1999, file photo shows a portion of the two floors of the Mutter Museum, a medical museum in Philadelphia.

Australian politician Lynda Voltz is pushing for the Mutter Museum to return... (Associated Press)      PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia medical museum said Tuesday it will return the skull of an Australian soldier who was killed in World War I to the Australian Army.      A military attache for the Australian Embassy will meet with Mutter Museum officials in the coming weeks to take the skull, the museum said in a statement.      \\"We can appreciate the position of, and are sympathetic to, the mission of the Australian Army,\\" said Robert Hicks, the museum's director. \\"The recovery of remains of soldiers who were lost in combat or died as prisoners of war is vital work.\\"      The remains are those of 27-year-old Pvt. Thomas Hurdis, of New South Wales, according to a statement from Brig. Shane Gabriel, the military attache.      The announcement came on 100th anniversary of the soldier's death.      Hurdis was wounded at the Battle of Polygon Wood, near Ypres, Belgium, on Sept. 28, 1917. His injuries included a bullet that is lodged and still visible near the left eye socket.      He was treated by a Philadelphia ophthalmologist in France. Five days after he was wounded, a disoriented Hurdis pulled off his bandages and bled to death.      Australian politician Linda Voltz has been pushing for the skull's return.      \\"Many families never knew the fate of their sons. The fact this soldier's remains were sitting in a museum after such a horrific death, where the head has obviously been separated from the body, is appalling,\\" she said in emailed comments over the weekend. She didn't immediately return a message seeking comment about Tuesday's announcement.      The skull was given to the museum in 1919 by the British government, supervised by the British Medical Services, the museum said. It was part of a collection intended for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers. The museum said it hadn't been displayed in years.      The museum said it was contacted by the Australian Army in August about the skull. The controversy was first reported last week by The Guardian newspaper.      The Mutter is known for its collection of organs preserved in jars, deformed skeletons and lifelike wax casts of shocking medical maladies. It was founded in 1863 by The College of Physicians, which still operates it.      The stated mission of the museum is to help the public \\"understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and to appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease.\\"      Exhibits include an 8-foot-long (2.4-meter-long) human colon, the body of a woman who essentially turned to soap, slides of Albert Einstein's brain and a tumor removed from President Grover Cleveland.      ___      This story has been corrected to show the announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the soldier's death, not days before the anniversary. ||||| Australia likes to refer to its battlefield dead, especially in the first and second world wars, as “the fallen” whose bodies, if found, were “laid to rest” in picturesque, peaceful cemeteries of blonde statuary and rosemary bush.      Our politicians invest significantly in commemorating them (some 600m-plus alone for first world war centenary events), and into finding, identifying and reburying those whose bodies the mud may surrender many decades later.      Making war illegal changed the world. But it’s becoming too easy to break the law Read more      So it is surprising to find the skull of a first world war Australian Anzac soldier, replete with the shocking facial injuries that killed him a century ago this week, featured online in an American medical museum’s grisly collection of sometimes freakish exhibits.      The skull, part of the collection of the Mütter Museum at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia, tells a shocking and tragic story of battlefield violence and intolerable physical suffering that official commemoration – with its almost ecclesiastical language of the fighting Anzac “spirit, the “fallen” and their “sacrifice” – all too often overlooks.      On 28 September 1917, the Anzac was shot in the mouth during the Battle of Polygon Wood (known also as the Third Ypres, part of the Battle of Passchendaele) in Belgium, and his right jaw destroyed by shrapnel while another bullet – still visible in his skull – struck his left sinus.      The museum’s explainer reads:      This Australian soldier’s skull has extensive damage caused by bullet wounds sustained in the Battle of Passchendale (or Third Ypres, Battle of Polygon Wood) in the First World War. He was shot on September 28, 1917. Most of the damage was caused by a lead bullet that entered the mouth and passed through the palate and right eye. Shrapnel destroyed the ascending ramus of the right jaw, and another bullet, visible here, struck the left frontal sinus. Philadelphia opthalmologist and surgeon WT Shoemaker treated this soldier at a battlefield hospital in France. This soldier survived his initial injuries and treatments. But, five days after his injuries, blind and disoriented, he pulled out the bandage materials in his mouth that packed the wounds. He bled to death.      It says Shoemaker donated the “Adult skull with ballistic trauma” to the museum in 1917, making possible an inference, of course, that the opthalmologist removed the head from the battlefield hospital. It’s hard to imagine what, if any, consent was involved.      Click on the icon reading “OUCH” and the illustration highlights the shrapnel damage to the soldier’s jaw, or, on the one reading “THE END”, to see a close up of the hole in his cheek that had been packed with bandage. “Pulling out the material that packed this space is what killed our soldier,” it explains.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Mutter Museum      The Anzac skull certainly tells a story of a terrible battlefield death. But as is so often the way when human remains become institutional collection items, it is stripped of human identity and past beyond the moments of injury and death. It is objectified by death, not what life – rich and interesting or otherwise – preceded it.      And, so, unfortunately, we know precious little about who this Anzac is. We don’t have his name or know who his family is or where he came from. Was he Indigenous or white? Even had he contemplated dying in war (what soldier who volunteers to go off and fight does not?) could he ever have imagined that his head would become a museum collection item and an object of popular curiosity?      If the Mütter Museum knows any of this, it is not letting on.      Despite my repeated requests, the museum has not detailed how: it acquired the Australian’s head; whether the rest of his body is in the museum or buried in a war cemetery; if the museum is privy to the dead man’s identity and whether the skull has been on temporary or permanent public display.      It is, in fact, likely that the rest of the body is buried at either Polygon Wood Cemetery or the nearby Buttes New British Cemetery. In the past decade the bodies of several Anzacs who died in fighting around Polygon Wood have been unearthed on local properties. Several have been identified using DNA techniques. All have been officially re-buried with either “known unto God” headstones or memorials bearing their re-established identities.      It is understood that the Australian Army’s office of Unrecovered War Casualties – which is mandated with recovering and identifying unaccounted for military personnel, is aware of the Mütter Museum’s Anzac skull and is making inquiries, possibly through the Australian Embassy in Washington.      Mütter describes itself as “America’s finest museum of medical history” which “displays its beautifully preserved collections of anatomical specimens, models, and medical instruments in a 19th-century ‘cabinet museum’ setting. The museum helps the public understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and to appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease”.      The Anzac skull is part of a collection that also includes “the soap lady” (a body exhumed in Philadelphia in 1875), Albert Einstein’s brain, Dr Joseph Hyrtl’s human skull collection, a plaster cast and the conjoined liver of “Siamese twins” Chang and Eng Bunker, the jaw tumour of President Grover Cleveland, and hundreds of body parts that illustrate disease and terrible war injuries.      The fourth and fifth divisions of the Australian Imperial Force suffered more than 5,700 casualties at the Battle of Polygon Wood, which began on 26 September 1917. It was the most devastating year of the war for the AIF; 12,000 Australians died in the extended battle of Passchendaele alone and 30,000, mostly on the western front, for the year.      From a population of less than 5 million in 1914, some 324,000 Australians enlisted and served overseas, and 61,720 died. Most are buried in official war graves close to the battlefields or field hospitals where they died. But tragically some 18,000 who died on the European western front were either never found or could not be identified at death.      The Anzac whose skull is displayed by Mütter would be ranked with the missing even though the museum might well be in a position to help name him due to the medical and personnel records that would have formed part of his battlefield treatment.      Australia's Anzac carnival of commemoration leaves some things not talked about Read more      Meanwhile, the display of the skull is anomalous with official Australian policies to remove from public display and repatriate human remains (overwhelmingly belonging to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestors) that are held by foreign collecting institutions – mostly museums and medical schools.      The National Museum of Australia has the remains of about 500 individuals that it has repatriated to Australia from foreign institutions but, for various reasons mostly to do with unestablished identity, has been unable to return to country.      The South Australian Museum, which has the largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander material culture in the world, holds the remains of several thousand Indigenous people.      The government has dedicated minimal resources and energy to the identification and repatriation of Indigenous remains, however. As Australia prepares to commemorate the AIF’s actions at Passchendaele and Polygon Wood this week, the official response to the Mütter Anzac skull display will, therefore, be most illuminating. ||||| \\"I'm really pleased to hear that, on the centenary of his death, Australian authorities have confirmed that the skull is that of Thomas Hurdis and that the museum is to return it,\\" said John Hartley, a military historian and member of the forum. \\"The right thing has been done here and we can look forward to Thomas' skull being buried, along with the rest of his remains, at the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Le Treport, France. I hope to pay my respects to this brave man during a battlefields trip next spring.\\" ||||| Return of remains of Thomas Hurdis, who died a century ago, comes after outcry over grisly display      An American medical museum has agreed to hand over to Australian authorities for burial the skull of a world war one Anzac servicemen who died of horrendous facial wounds a century ago.      The Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia confirmed in a statement it would hand over the skull, which has been independently established to be that of Private Thomas Hurdis of the 59th Battalion Australian Imperial Force who died on 3 October 1917.      Controversy over the skull erupted last month after the Guardian reported it was on display at the museum, complete with a grisly description of the wounds that had killed Private Hurdis.      The Anzac skull that tells a shocking and tragic story of battlefield violence | Paul Daley Read more      In the statement Mütter said the Australian army first contacted it about the skull in August. This is when the Guardian first approached the museum with questions about the provenance – and human identity – of the skull.      The museum removed the skull from display last week after the military attache at the Australian embassy in Washington contacted the institution stressing the need to repatriate the remains of missing soldiers.      In a letter to the museum, the attache wrote: “The repatriation and interment of Private Hurdis’ skull is consistent with our ongoing efforts to recover, identify and formally inter human remains of our fallen from all conflicts, notwithstanding our affirmative recognition that the accession, stewardship and use of the skull is entirely consistent with the applicable laws and protocols.”      The museum said in its statement that the skull “was given to the museum in 1919 by the British government, supervised by the British Medical Services. The skull was given as part of a collection intended for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers”.      However, in an explainer about the skull, since removed from the museum’s website, Mütter had said the skull was donated in 1917 by Philadelphia ophthalmologist WT Shoemaker who treated Hurdis’s wounds at an American military hospital in France.      The explainer read: “This Australian soldier’s skull has extensive damage caused by bullet wounds sustained in the Battle of Passchendaele (or Third Ypres, Battle of Polygon Wood) in the first world war. He was shot on 28 September 1917. Most of the damage was caused by a lead bullet that entered the mouth and passed through the palate and right eye. Shrapnel destroyed the ascending ramus of the right jaw, and another bullet, visible here, struck the left frontal sinus.      “Philadelphia ophthalmologist and surgeon WT Shoemaker treated this soldier at a battlefield hospital in France. This soldier survived his initial injuries and treatments. But, five days after his injuries, blind and disoriented, he pulled out the bandage materials in his mouth that packed the wounds. He bled to death.”      The rest of Hurdis’s remains are buried at Mont Huon military cemetery in Le Tréport, France, where his skull will soon be buried too.      The Mütter director, Robert Hicks, said: “We can appreciate the position of, and are sympathetic to, the mission of the Australian army. The recovery of remains of soldiers who were lost in combat or died as prisoners of war is vital work.      “The Mütter Museum observes a high standard of care and respect regarding human remains, and our observances of relevant laws and protocols is consistent with best practice in United States museums.”      US museum under fire over display of skull of Australian soldier Read more      Private Hurdis’s brother John, also an AIF soldier, went missing in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916. It is possible DNA from the skull could be used to identify his body if it is among more than 100 that have been found in mass graves but cannot be personally identified.      The American and British armies have a long-established practice of allowing the collection of human medical samples without permission from the relevant soldiers or their families for medical education purposes providing the individuals from whom they were taken were not identified.      Through a simple triangulation of Australian military records, however, it was possible to easily identify the skull in the Mütter collection as being that of Private Thomas Hurdis, who lived in Sydney’s inner west before he volunteered to fight. |||||Summary:","output":"The Mütter Museum in Philadelphia has agreed to return the skull of an Australian soldier who died during World War I to Australian authorities for burial.

Question: What are the sections of the organ in a person's head that are concerned with sentimental experiences and are named after the Greek word for sea horse? Context: Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.

Summarize this article: Burgess, 26, took time off to contemplate his future after criticism of his role in England's World Cup campaign, before returning to Bath. He has been heavily linked with a move back to former club South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League. \\"We have registered an interest,\\" Hetherington told BBC Sport. \\"We are fully aware that he is contracted to Bath, but we are waiting in the wings if Bath allow him to speak to clubs. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"Any Super League club or NRL would be interested in a player like Sam. \\"Sam may well remain at Bath or go back to Souths, but if he was available, and we recognise that a transfer fee would be required, we are keen.\\" Bath coach Mike Ford remains confident that he can persuade the Dewsbury-born forward to stay at the Premiership club and continue his development as a union player. \\"Sam's frame of mind since he's come back has been brilliant. He's come in and cracked on and has trained very well for these couple of days,\\" said Ford on Tuesday. He told BBC Radio Bristol: \\"Sam attracts media attention, we can handle it, we laugh about it at times. Nothing's changed.\\" One stumbling block that could delay any return to the Rabbitohs is the salary cap which would need to accommodate Burgess' pay, as their recruitment has largely been completed for 2016. Leeds have the ability to offset £175,000 of any potential annual salary away from the Super League salary cap, under the new Marquee Player Rule. \\"Yes he would [be suited to that], we supported the principle of a marquee player system,\\" Hetherington added. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"However, we always said it was unlikely we'd take up the option unless they were exceptional, and Burgess falls into that exceptional bracket.\\" The former Bradford Bulls forward left for Australia at the start of 2010 and was part of a quartet of Burgess brothers at Souths until the end of the 2014 season. After helping Souths win their first NRL title for 43 years, Burgess switched to Bath.

Understanding the impact: Since the flowers have not been delivered as expected, you may be disappointed or frustrated, as this could have affected a special occasion or caused inconvenience. 4. Considering expectations: As a customer, you expect timely and accurate delivery of your order. The flower delivery service's inability to locate the flowers or provide clear information does not meet your expectations. 5.

As a prominent figure in space mission history, his contributions to NASA and his impact on space exploration are truly remarkable.  His journey began with strengthening his academic foundation at AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology), where he received his M.S. in 1962. Being a fighter pilot, he demonstrated extraordinary mastery and prowess which paved the way to his pivotal role in the groundbreaking Apollo 8 mission. His professional aptitude led him to serve under NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is responsible for the civilian space program as well as for aeronautics and aerospace research in the United States.  In retrospect, Apollo 8 was a seminal mission that played a pivotal role in the history of NASA's space explorations. Apollo 8 was the second human spaceflight mission carried out by NASA as part of the Apollo program and was launched on December 21, 1968. Among the key crew members of Apollo 8 was Frank Borman, who like Anders had devoted his life to the pursuit of space exploration and the understanding of outer space. The Apollo 8 spaceflight is particularly noteworthy as it was the first mission to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit, reach the Moon, orbit it, and safely return. Within this historical context, William Anders was an indomitable figure whose contributions were essential to the operation's success, and furthermore, to the developments in following space explorations.  Interestingly, the backup pilot for the Apollo 8 mission was none other than Buzz Aldrin, another illustrious name in the history of manned space flights. Aldrin is famously known for his contribution to the Apollo 11 mission, where he became the second man to walk on the Moon. After his monumental contribution to space exploration, William Anders decided to retire on September 1, 1969. His retirement, nevertheless, marked the end of a brilliant career; the legacy he left behind continues to resonate and inspire countless astronauts and space enthusiasts around the globe. His life and accomplishments embody the spirit of pursuing the unknown and reaching for the stars, quite literally, and stand as a testament to human courage and ingenuity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The future of written English will owe more to Hollywood films than Dickens or Shakespeare, if the findings of a study into children's writing are anything to go by. Researchers who looked at the entries to a national competition found they were increasingly using Americanisms such as garbage, trash can, sidewalk, candy, sneakers, soda, and flashlight. The stories, written by pupils aged 7 to 13, show how fairy cakes are referred to as cupcakes and a dinner jacket has become a tuxedo. \\"Smart\\" is now often used for \\"clever\\" and \\"cranky\\" for \\"irritable\\". Television also has a powerful influence on children's work, with Lady Gaga and Argentinean footballer Lionel Messi among the famous names from TV cropping up repeatedly. But pupils are let down by basic spelling, punctuation and grammar, according to the study by Oxford University Press (OUP), which looked at the entries to BBC Radio Two's \\"500 Words\\" competition. Children struggled to correctly spell simple words such as \\"does\\" and \\"clothes\\" and often failed to use the past tense correctly, frequently writing \\"rised\\" instead of \\"rose\\" or \\"thinked\\" instead of \\"thought\\". Researchers also found that punctuation was underused, especially semi-colons and speech marks. Some did not know how to use capital letters. However, exclamation marks were overused. Researchers found 35,171 examples in total, with some young writers using five at a time! Popular US fiction such as the Twilight novels and films is thought to be fueling the increasing use of American vocabulary and spelling. Meanwhile, fears that texting was spoiling children's written work were unfounded, they said, with youngsters only using text language when they were referring to a text message. Samantha Armstrong from OUP said: \\"Perhaps we are catching a glimpse of the language of the future.\\" Chris Evans, whose radio show runs the competition, said the results were \\"fascinating\\", adding: \\"Who'd have thought that Messi and Gaga would be some of the most used names?\\" The passage is intended to   _  .

This is evidenced by the increasing use of Americanisms in children's writing, such as \\"garbage,\\" \\"sidewalk,\\" and \\"cupcake,\\" among others. Additionally, the passage mentions the influence of television on children's work, with pop culture figures like Lady Gaga and Lionel Messi, who are frequently mentioned in their stories. The passage also discusses the areas where pupils struggle, such as spelling, punctuation, and grammar. It highlights common errors, such as incorrect spelling of simple words, and improper usage of past tense verbs. Furthermore, the passage notes that certain punctuation marks, such as semi-colons and speech marks, are underused, while exclamation marks are overused. The passage ultimately aims to discuss the changes and evolution occurring in written English in Britain as a result of various influences, particularly popular US culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

If your pilot is forced to turn back only for his lack of passing a certain test, you will be certainly shocked. This very thing happened to the passengers on Flight BE1431 on Thursday.

Tell your parent about interesting things that happen to you, and ask them how their day is going. You don't have to talk about big, important topics.","output":"Simply discussing everyday occurrences can lead to a deeper and more trusting relationship. As this connection strengthens over time, the conversations may begin to cover more personal and sensitive subjects. It's essential to approach these matters with delicacy and understanding – and asking about a parent's previous marriage is no exception. To inquire about your parent's past marriage, first, ensure that you have established a comfortable rapport and that the atmosphere is right for discussing personal topics. Avoid delving into such matters in front of others or during social gatherings, as it may cause discomfort or embarrassment. Instead, choose a relaxed and private setting where both of you feel at ease to open up about your lives. When you feel that the moment is appropriate, you could lead the conversation by sharing your own life experiences or reflecting on the complexities of relationships. For instance, if you recently watched a movie or read a book that dealt with the subject of divorce or past relationships, you might mention this as a way of broaching the subject. As you ease into the topic, refrain from asking prying or invasive questions. Instead, express genuine curiosity and empathy towards your parent's personal journey. A good starting point could be asking how they met their former partner or what they've learned from past relationships. Remember to be patient and offer a listening ear, rather than taking a judgmental or intrusive stance. Your parent may not immediately divulge every detail about their previous marriage, and that's alright. They might need time to process their thoughts or feel uncertain about sharing intimate information. Demonstrating compassion and understanding will encourage them to gradually open up as they become more comfortable. Moreover, make it clear that your interest in their past arises from a desire to better comprehend their life story and experiences, rather than to criticize or blame. This can help your parent feel valued and respected, as well as lessen any potential defensiveness or reluctance to discuss the subject. In the end, broaching the topic of your parent's previous marriage may not only provide you with valuable insights into their life but also strengthen your bond with them. As you continue engaging in open and authentic conversations, you'll foster a relationship founded on mutual trust, empathy, and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren. The answer to this question is:","output":"The first names of the people who discover that their creation is aging at a vastly accelerated rate are Clive and Elsa. They are genetic engineers who created a human-animal hybrid named Dren while working at the company N.E.R.D."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Teacher:Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: 1. Click and collect The availability and operation of click and collect services will be limited to retailers selling essential items such as clothes, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books. Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted. 2. Takeaway services Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff. 3. Alcohol consumption It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public. This will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. It is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. 4. Working from home The Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible. The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals. However, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible. 5. Home maintenance The Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses. Current guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. This guidance is now being put into law. 6. Stay at home message The final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home. This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations. Currently the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose. The amendment will make it clear that people \\"must not leave or remain outside\\" the home unless it is for an essential purpose. The Scottish government's full lockdown guidance is available here.

Their ideas were strong, and some people thought they were a bit too strong, thinking that the website's ideas came off as hurtful or mean. This website became known as being \\"right-wing,\\" which means they leaned more towards certain ideas or politics that some people might not agree with.  Now, in our world, websites have something called advertising. Advertising is when companies show pictures and words that talk about their products so people will want to buy them.

Kellogg's told Breitbart that they do not want to put advertising on their website anymore. This decision made Breitbart very sad and disappointed. Breitbart thought that Kellogg's was not being fair, and they wanted people to know how unhappy they were.  So, the people at Breitbart asked their friends and those who like their website to not buy any Kellogg's products.

He led an attack on a machine gun position and continued to fire at the enemy despite being seriously wounded , killing two of the enemy and dispersing the remainder of the gun crew . General John Pershing listed George Dilboy as \`\` one of the ten great heroes '' who \`\` died in the battlefield of France with super-human heroism and valor . '' Dilboy is buried in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery .  - Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the American Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars. The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense, controls the cemetery.  - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\".  - The Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President.  - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\".  - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - An autocannon or automatic cannon is a large, fully automatic, rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour-piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater), but are usually smaller than a field gun or other artillery. When used on its own, the word \\"autocannon\\" indicates a single-barrel weapon. When multiple rotating barrels are involved, the word \\"rotary\\" is added, and such a weapon is referred to as a \\"rotary autocannon.\\" Modern autocannons are typically not single soldier-portable or stand-alone units, rather they are usually vehicle-mounted, aircraft-mounted, or boat-mounted, or even remote-operated as in some naval applications. As such, ammunition is typically fed from a belt to reduce reloading or for a faster rate of fire, but a magazine remains an option. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS).  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A submachine gun (SMG) is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges. The term \\"submachine gun\\" was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - The word bullet is a firearm term. A bullet is a projectile expelled from the barrel of a firearm. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle (boullet) which means \\"small ball.\\" Bullets are made of a variety of materials. They are available singly as they would be used in muzzle loading and cap and ball firearms, as part of a paper cartridge, and much more commonly as a component of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large numbers of styles and constructions depending on how they will be used. Many bullets have specialized functions, such as hunting, target shooting, training, defense, and warfare.   - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law.

Image copyright MARCEL MOCHET/GETTY Image caption A colony of king penguins in the Antarctic      Penguins can taste only sour and salty food, scientists have discovered.      A genetic study suggests the flightless birds lost three of the five basic tastes long ago in evolution.      Taste is critical for survival in most animals, but may not matter in the penguin, which swallows fish whole, say researchers in China and the US.      Many other birds are unable to taste sweet things, but they do have receptors for detecting bitter and umami (or meaty) flavours.      The discovery was made when researchers decoding penguin genomes found some of the taste genes were missing.      Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception Prof Jianzhi Zhang, University of Michigan      A closer look at the DNA of penguins revealed that all species lack functioning genes for the receptors of sweet, umami, and bitter tastes.      \\"Based on genetic data, penguins are believed to have sour and salty tastes, but have lost sweet, umami, and bitter tastes,\\" lead researcher Prof Jianzhi Zhang, of the University of Michigan, US, and Wuhan University, China, told the BBC.      The umami taste gives food the strong, savoury flavour associated with meat.      Lacking this sense is surprising for a carnivorous animal, but does not matter that much in the penguin, which swallows fish without chewing.      \\"Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception,\\" said Prof Zhang.      \\"Although it is unclear whether these traits are a cause or a consequence of their major taste loss.\\"      Icy clue      The findings, published in Current Biology journal, were a puzzle, he added.      One clue comes from the bird's evolution on the frozen ice sheets of Antarctica.      Sending signals from sweet, umami, and bitter (but not sour or salty) taste receptors to the brain does not work at very low temperatures.      This may have led to the penguin gradually losing its sense of taste, say the researchers.      Intriguingly, the sweet taste is missing in almost all birds. The hummingbird, which feeds on sweet nectar, is an exception. |||||             Penguins no longer taste their food the way most of the animal kingdom does, according to a new study.      According to the researchers, vertebrates usually have five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. But after studying the genetic sequencing of Adelie and emperor penguins, analyzing penguin tissue, and comparing the birds genomes to 14 other non-penguin bird species, the researchers discovered that penguins have lost all but the salty and sour tastes.      “Penguins eat fish, so you would guess that they need the umami receptor genes, but for some reason they don’t have them,” said study author Jianzhi Zhang, a professor at the University of Michigan Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in a statement. “These findings are surprising and puzzling, and we do not have a good explanation for them. But we have a few ideas.”      The researchers believe that perhaps over 20 million years ago, the freezing climates of the arctic somehow interfered with the penguins’ ability to taste.      The researchers of the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, were tipped off to the lack of taste among penguins when they were contacted by a genomics institute in China called BGI which had originally sequenced the genomes of the Adelie and emperor penguins and couldn’t find their taste genes.      The researchers there asked the University of Michigan researchers to take a second look to see if what they found was true. Unfortunately for the penguins, they may be missing out on the variety of flavors found in their favorite fish. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Penguins are interesting birds that live in very cold places like Antarctica. Scientists have discovered that these penguins can only taste sour and salty food, but not sweet, umami, and bitter food. This is because they are missing some important taste genes, which could be because their taste receptors don't work well in very cold temperatures.

Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017.

The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality.  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - The Rätikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graubünden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Prättigau is its limit, in the north the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups.  - Vorarlberg is the westernmost federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Austria.

Are the following two questions the same? Why can't people just shut up? On your planet, do people ever shut up? Possible answers:  (a). no.  (b). yes. The answer is:","output":"(b). yes. Although the two questions might seem different at first glance, they are fundamentally asking the same thing. The first question, \\"Why can't people just shut up?\\" is seeking to understand the reasons behind why human beings often have difficulty refraining from speaking or staying silent when it may be more appropriate or beneficial to do so. This question implies that human individuals sometimes engage in excessive talking or communication that others find disruptive or irritating. The second question, \\"On your planet, do people ever shut up?\\" can be rephrased as \\"Do people on your planet ever stop talking?\\" This question is also inquiring about the ability of individuals within a society or community to stay silent or cease communicating when it may be helpful or necessary. Both questions are focused on exploring the behaviors and tendencies of people when it comes to communication and silence. They both aim to understand if, when, and why people choose not to speak or stop speaking, which may vary based on cultural, social, or personal factors. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that these two questions are essentially the same, as they focus on a similar subject matter and are seeking to uncover the same information about human behavior. In addition to the similarities in the subject matter, both questions also contain elements of frustration or dissatisfaction with the level of conversation or communication exhibited by people. The phrasing of the questions implies that the person asking is perhaps aggravated by the perceived inability of others to maintain silence when it would be warranted or preferable. This shared sense of frustration further solidifies the connection between the two questions, as they both carry a similar emotional aspect as well. Therefore, the answer is (b). yes – the two questions are indeed the same, despite differences in their phrasing and structure. They both ask about the reasons and circumstances related to human communication and silence, as well as conveying a shared sentiment of frustration with excessive talking or communication among people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Raji opened the scoring three minutes before the end of the first quarter, Mason Crosby completed the XP to give the Packers the 7-0 lead after one. Tom Crabtree received a 5-yd TD pass from Aaron Rodgers that blew the lead to 14, before LeGarrette Blount ran 54 yards to slice the lead to seven. Later on Connor Barth successfully connected on a 23-yd FG and the lead was just four, but two minutes before the end of the half Jordy Nelson got a 5-yd pass for a TD and the lead at the half was 21-10. The third quarter was less action and scoring, only Barth hit a 32-yd FG to make it an eight-point game. Mike Williams made it even a two-point game with an early TD in the fourth, but Tampa tried a two-point conversion to tie the game, but Kellen Winslow II dropped the ball after he originally caught it. Tampa had three penalties of Pass interferences in a short time of period and the whole momentum went back to the Packers and John Kuhn made a 2-yd run for a TD. Tampa were not done yet, 4:31 before the end, Dezmon Briscoe closed the lead once again to two. But Nelson decided the game with his second touchdown of the evening. How many games did the Packers have coming into this game?","output":"To determine how many games the Packers had coming into this game, we need to analyze the given information: \\"The Packers took on the Buccaneers and managed to get the 10th victory of the season.\\" This statement indicates that the Packers won their 10th game of the season after defeating the Buccaneers. To find out how many games they had leading up to this, we need to subtract the recent win from the total number of victories.

Gene A broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene is defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions. Q: What sort of definition can be used to conveniently encompass the complexity of diverse phenomena?","output":"A broad operational definition can be conveniently used to encompass the complexity of diverse phenomena related to genes. This definition categorizes genes according to their functional products, such as proteins or RNAs, rather than focusing on specific DNA loci. By doing so, the definition takes into account the various functional aspects of genes, including the overlapping nature of functional products, which may be encoded from the same genomic sequences, and the gene-associated regulatory elements that play crucial roles in gene expression and regulation. This broad definition is particularly useful because it acknowledges the complexity of the genetic architecture and offers a more holistic perspective on the functionality and roles of genes. Rather than limiting the concept of a gene to a specific segment of DNA, it accounts for the fact that genes may possess multiple functional products and that their regulation may involve a diverse array of genomic sequences. Some key components and elements captured by this broad operational definition include: 1. Genomic sequences: The full range of DNA sequences within the genome that are involved in encoding functional products or regulating gene expression. 2. Functional products: The proteins or RNA molecules that are produced as a result of gene expression and have various functional roles within the cell. 3. Overlapping functional products: Instances where multiple functional products are encoded within a single genomic region, potentially leading to the formation of multiple distinct proteins or RNAs. 4. Gene-associated regulatory elements: Additional genomic sequences that are involved in regulating the expression, splicing, or translation of the gene and its products. These elements may include promoters, enhancers, and silencers, among others. By employing this broad operational definition, researchers can better understand and investigate the intricate mechanisms underlying gene expression, regulation, and function within the context of the genome. This comprehensive approach allows for a more accurate and complete representation of genes and their roles in biological processes, enabling further advancements in areas such as genomics, molecular biology, and genetic engineering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overthrew the Monégasque constitution?  Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Write a summary based on this article: Greenland's many supraglacial lakes have been seen suddenly and mysteriously draining as climate change causes this region to warm, and now scientists have finally explained the mechanism behind this phenomenon.      The findings were published in the journal Nature.      The Greenland Ice Sheet, the second largest ice sheet in the world, has long been of concern to scientists as rising temperatures continue to melt its glaciers. Consequently, this meltwater forms thousands of lakes atop the ice sheet each spring and summer. And yet, these vast bodies of water can empty in a matter of just a few hours.      When they drain, they send torrents of water to the base of the ice sheet thousands of feet below, lubricating the interface between rock and ice. That allows the ice sheet to flow faster to the ocean and discharge ice into ocean, which causes sea levels to rise faster.      So what exactly is causing this sudden drainage?      In 2008, scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the University of Washington documented for the first time how the icy bottoms of lakes atop the Greenland Ice Sheet can crack open suddenly. Initially, they thought the sheer weight of water was putting too much pressure on the ice to the point that it cracked. However, this theory did not explain why some lake bottoms cracked while others did not.      \\"Our discovery will help us predict more accurately how supraglacial lakes will affect ice sheet flow and sea level rise as the region warms in the future,\\" lead author Laura Stevens from WHOI said in a press release.      Stevens and her colleagues deployed a network of 16 GPS units around North Lake, a 1.5-mile-long supraglacial lake in southwest Greenland. This lake was among those seen suddenly cracking and draining. They recorded ice movement before, during and after three rapid lake drainages in summer 2011-2013.      It turns out that tension from below the ice sheet, and not above it from the lakes, was causing cracks in the ice. (Scroll to read on...)      According to the data, in the 6 to 12 hours before the lake cracked and drained, the ice around the lake moved upward and slipped horizontally. The scientists say that meltwater had begun to drain through a nearby system of moulins - vertical channels through the ice - which connected the surface to the base of the ice sheet 3,215 feet below. The accumulating water creates a bulge that floats the entire ice sheet, creating tension at the surface underneath the lake. The stress builds up until it is relieved by a sudden large crack in the ice below the lake.      \\"In some ways, ice behaves like Silly Putty - if you push up on it slowly, it will stretch; if you do it with enough force, it will crack,\\" Stevens explained. \\"Ordinarily, pressure at the ice sheet surface is directed into the lake basin, compressing the ice together. But, essentially, if you push up on the ice sheet and create a dome instead of a bowl, you get tension that stretches the ice surface apart. You change the stress state of the surface ice from compressional to tensional, which promotes crack formation.\\"      Though once this tension initiates the crack, the volume of water in the lake does play a role. Lakewater pours into the crack and widens it even more, keeping it filled with water all the way to base of the thick ice sheet and forming what are called hydrofractures.      \\"You need both conditions - tension to initiate the crack and the large volume of water to amplify it - for hydrofractures to form,\\" Stevens said. Meaning, the weight from meltwater alone is not enough to cause supraglacial lakes to suddenly drain.      This entire underlying mechanism is so impactful, it can reportedly drain more than 11 billion gallons of water out of North Lake in about 90 minutes. That's even faster than the water goes over Niagara Falls.      By better understanding these sudden drainages scientists hope to determine how supraglacial lakes will affect sea level rise as climate conditions shift in the future.

Now they have found a surprising mechanism that triggers the cracks.      Scientists had theorized that the sheer weight of the water in these supraglacial lakes applied pressure that eventually cracked the ice, but they could not explain why some lake bottoms cracked while others did not.      \\"Our discovery will help us predict more accurately how supraglacial lakes will affect ice sheet flow and sea level rise as the region warms in the future,\\" said lead author Laura Stevens, a graduate student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (MIT/WHOI) Joint Program in Oceanography.      The research was published June 4 in the journal Nature.      To find out what triggers sudden lake drainages, a research team, including Stevens and colleagues from WHOI, the University of Washington, MIT, and the University of Tasmania, deployed a network of 16 GPS units around North Lake, a 1.5-mile-long supraglacial lake in southwest Greenland, where the scientists first documented large-scale cracks and lake drainages. They used these instruments to record movements of the ice before, during, and after three rapid lake drainages in the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013.      Their study showed that in the 6 to 12 hours before the lake cracked and drained, the ice around the lake moved upward and slipped horizontally. The scientists say that meltwater had begun to drain through a nearby system of moulins (vertical conduits through the ice), which connected the surface to the base of the ice sheet 3,215 feet below. The accumulating water creates a bulge that floats the entire ice sheet, creating tension at the surface underneath the lake. The stress builds up until it is relieved by a sudden large crack in the ice below the lake.      \\"In some ways, ice behaves like Silly Putty--if you push up on it slowly, it will stretch; if you do it with enough force, it will crack,\\" said Stevens. \\"Ordinarily, pressure at the ice sheet surface is directed into the lake basin, compressing the ice together. But, essentially, if you push up on the ice sheet and create a dome instead of a bowl, you get tension that stretches the ice surface apart. You change the stress state of the surface ice from compressional to tensional, which promotes crack formation.\\"      Once the tension initiates the crack, the volume of water in the lake does play a critical role, surging into the opening, widening and extending it, and keeping it filled with water all the way to base of the thick ice sheet. These are called hydrofractures, and the scientists have documented how they can drain more than 11 billion gallons of water out of North Lake in about 90 minutes. At times, water flowed out of the lake bottom faster than the water goes over Niagara Falls, the scientists estimated.      \\"You need both conditions--tension to initiate the crack and the large volume of water to amplify it--for hydrofractures to form,\\" Stevens said. The key finding of this study is that without the former, even large supraglacial lakes will retain their water.      At the base of the ice sheet, the water that drains from the lake lubricates the interface between ice and rock, allowing the ice sheet to slide faster toward the coast. That in turn accelerates the outflow of ice from land to sea and causes sea levels to rise faster. So understanding the mechanisms that trigger the drainages will help scientists predict more precisely how supraglacial lakes will affect sea level rise as climate conditions shift in the future.      The GPS network also recorded the more sudden and momentous movements of the ice sheet surface at the time of the hydrofracture, showing that portions of the ice sheet bed beneath the lake can slip up to a foot and a half. That is equivalent to the movement caused by a magnitude-5.5 earthquake.      \\"It's just a different type of solid crystals--ice instead of rock--breaking due to stress,\\" said Jeff McGuire, a co-author on the study and a seismologist at WHOI. The research team spanned scientific disciplines, including McGuire, a seismologist; Mark Behn, a geophysicist at WHOI who studies faults in Earth's crust; glaciologists Sarah Das of WHOI, and Ian Joughin and David Shean of the University of Washington; Tom Herring, a GPS expert at MIT, and Matt King, who studies geodesy, Antarctic ice sheets, and sea level at the University of Tasmania.      Thousands of supraglacial lakes form each spring and summer on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet as sunlight returns to the region. The heat melts snow and ice into water that pools in depressions in the ice sheet to form lakes. As the region becomes warmer, more lakes will likely form, leading to a first-order prediction of more hydrofractures, more lubrication, more ice sheet slippage, and faster-rising sea levels.      However, discovering the new trigger mechanism changes the equation, because the trigger is less likely to occur at lakes at higher elevations on the ice sheet--even though water volumes in those lakes can be large. Stevens explained that the ice sheet further inland is thicker and moves more slowly. The ice deeper down flows viscously, dampening impacts on the surface topography. That results in a flatter surface where fewer lake basins and crevasses form. Fewer crevasses mean less water leakage to the base, which reduces bulging that increases surface stresses.      #      The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a private, non-profit organization on Cape Cod, Mass., dedicated to marine research, engineering, and higher education.

Funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cryospheric Sciences Program ||||| Geoscientists have solved a decade-long mystery of how some of the large lakes that sit atop the Greenland ice sheet can completely drain billions of gallons of water in a matter of hours.      In 2006, Greenland's North Lake, a 2.2 square-mile (5.6 square kilometers) supraglacial meltwater lake, drained almost 12 billion gallons of water in less than two hours. In a study published two years later, researchers determined that this astonishing phenomenon is possible because giant hydro-fractures(water-driven cracks) can form directly beneath the lake basin and stretch down to the bed of the ice sheet, emptying the lake of water. But just how these fractures developed has been unknown — until now.      In the new study, published today (June 3) in the journal Nature, scientists using GPS technology discovered that the hydro-fractures form from tension-related stress caused by movements of the ice sheet. These movements are, in turn, triggered by the trickling meltwater. [See Gorgeous Images of Greenland's Supraglacial Lakes]      The new research may help scientists better understand how much the ice sheet is contributing to sea level rise, researchers say.      Most of Greenland's supraglacial lakes drain slowly when superficial streams route water into nearby, permanent crevasses or moulins (vertical conduits or shafts in a glacier). Fairly recently, however, satellite images showed that about 13 percent of the lakes drain quickly, emptying completely within 24 hours.      \\"The images would show the lake there one day, and gone the next day,\\" said first author of the new study, Laura Stevens, a glaciology doctoral candidate with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (MIT-WHOI) Joint Program. \\"So we've known for the last 10 to 15 years that the water could disappear quickly.\\"      A moulin, or crack, formed along the hydro-fracture through Greenland's North Lake basin continues to drain meltwater to the bed after the 2013 North Lake rapid drainage. Credit: Ian Joughin      The 2008 research, led by Stevens' co-author Sarah Das, a WHOI geological scientist, showed that temporary hydro-fractures could cause rapid lake drainage on an unprecedented scale. But that research was unable to determine what triggered the cracks in the first place. Two other, similar studies of different rapidly draining supraglacial lakes were also unable to identify what caused the hydro-fractures.      \\"The coverage of GPS stations was not dense enough,\\" Stevens told Live Science. \\"This study goes beyond previous studies on the lakes, because we have 16 GPS stations, as opposed to one or four.\\"      When meltwater in the summer drains to the bed from the ice surface through crevasses or moulins, it can cause the area within and around the lake basin to be \\"jacked up,\\" Stevens said. Additionally, it can decrease the surface area of the ice-sheet bed that's in contact with the underlying bedrock, lubricating the bed and making it easier for the bed to move horizontally.      Placed around North Lake, the team's 16 GPS stations recorded these two types of movements — called uplift and slip — between 2011 and 2013. This provided an in-depth perspective on the meltwater injected into the bed before, during and after the yearly drainages.      \\"We found that before we get the main expression of the lake drainage, there is a period of time (about six to 12 hours) where uplift and slip increase,\\" Stevens said. \\"That motion is enough to take the surface of the ice sheet and put portions of it in high tension that allows cracks to start forming.\\"      The study provides a clearer picture of the amount and location of the meltwater that travels down to the ice-sheet bed, which could help scientists better understand how fast the ice sheet flows during the summer, Stevens said.      This is important because the inland ice that moves toward the coast gets funneled to so-called outlet glaciers, which are tonguelike protrusions that can break off to form icebergs that may drift off into the ocean and eventually melt.      \\"It's half of the equation of how the Greenland ice sheet contributes to sea level rise, with the other half being the years when the ice sheet melts quicker than the snow is deposited,\\" Stevens said.

According to the data, in the 6 to 12 hours before the lake cracked and drained, the ice around the lake moved upward and slipped horizontally. The scientists say that meltwater had begun to drain through a nearby system of moulins - vertical channels through the ice - which connected the surface to the base of the ice sheet 3,215 feet below. The accumulating water creates a bulge that floats the entire ice sheet, creating tension at the surface underneath the lake. The stress builds up until it is relieved by a sudden large crack in the ice below the lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

And yet, I stubbornly keep my BlackBerry in my bag and on my desk, fully charged. As with my Palm Vx of yesterday, breaking up with a beloved gadget is hard to do, especially when you have history. My BlackBerry and I go back over 10 years. We met at a telecom conference in Hong Kong. I will never forget the wonder of our first wireless e-mail. Look, I'm no softie when it comes to loving and leaving my electronics. I've thrown out old Macs. I've recycled expired Sony Ericsson handsets. I've even trashed now-antique digital cameras. But this is the longest and saddest gadget breakup I've ever gone through. I can no longer accept its limits: A disappointing apps portfolio, clunky interface, and frankly lame camera. Over the years, we grew apart. I started to dabble in social media and mobile photography. The tools on offer from other devices were far better in functionality, speed and resolution. I wanted my BlackBerry to change, and yet it never managed to deliver. And suddenly, I felt like it just wasn't there for me. I have stopped using the beloved device. But like the other 50 million BlackBerry users still out there, I just can't pull the plug. Read more: BlackBerry's dwindling users ponder uncertain future.

Put it into a vitrine.\\" After looking up the word \\"vitrine,\\" I realized that putting an expired gadget in a glass box is like taxidermy for a deceased pet. Sorry. Just can't go there. But not everyone was as keen to ditch the BlackBerry. My ever-compassionate colleague John Vause said, \\"Don't do it... it will get better... I promise.\\" On Monday, BlackBerry announced that it was being taken private -- a headline that raised hopes among loyalists that change is sure to come. Meanwhile, my pal Eunice Yoon implored me to keep hope alive with the reminder, \\"the typing is so much easier!\\" But the doubt has already settled in, and I'm already starting to see my BlackBerry in the past tense. \\"Just for fun, I fire up my circa 2005 Treo 750 sometimes,\\" reminisced J.

Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell, frankly. At the centre of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well. The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie. It's an acting masterclass. Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour. Charlie Creed-Miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors, maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor. 4/10 What is the sentiment of this review?

Objective: How to ozonate your drinking water? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"You have not provided any solutions for me to compare. If you provide different solutions, I will assess which one would be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. In the meantime, I can explain how to ozonate drinking water step-by-step: 1. Acquire an ozone generator: To ozonate your drinking water, you will need a device that produces ozone. Ozone generators are available in the market, and they come in varying capacities. Choose one that fits your intended usage. 2. Prepare the drinking water: Fill a clean container with the drinking water you intend to ozonate. 3. Place the diffuser stone of the ozone generator: Attach the silicone ozone-tube to the ozone outlet in the generator. Then, attach the other end of the tube to the diffuser stone. Submerge the diffuser stone into the drinking water but ensure it is not touching the bottom of the container, as it will aid in the distribution of ozone. Justification: Placing the diffuser stone in the water is essential to creating a fine stream of ozone bubbles, which increases the contact between ozone and water molecules, enhancing the ozonation process. 4. Turn on the ozone generator: Activate the ozone generator and set the desired ozone concentration and timer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 30 minutes of treatment time is recommended for general disinfection purposes. Justification: Ozone generators require time to produce and dissolve ozone gas in the water. Setting an appropriate duration for the process ensures optimum ozonation and disinfection. 5. Wait for the process to complete: Allow the system to run for the specified duration. The ozone will dissolve in the water, oxidizing contaminants and microorganisms and removing any unpleasant odors or tastes. Justification: The duration of ozonation allows enough time for ozone molecules to react with contaminants and microorganisms, ensuring a thorough disinfection and purification process. 6. Turn off the ozone generator after completion: Once the process is complete, turn off the device, remove the diffuser stone, and allow the water to rest for a few minutes. This will give time for any residual ozone in the water to dissipate.  Justification: Letting the water rest allows residual ozone to convert back to oxygen, ensuring that the water is safe to drink without exposure to excessive ozone. 7. Store or consume the ozonated water: You can now store the treated water in a clean, closed container, or consume it as needed. Please provide the different solutions if you would like me to compare and assess which one is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A new argument has been put forward as to whether penguins are disturbed by the presence of tourists in Antarctica. Previous research by scientists from Keil University in Germany monitored Adelie penguins and noted that the birds' heart rates increased dramatically at the sight of a human as far as 30 meters away.  But new research using an artificial egg, which is equipped to measure heart rates, disputes this.  Scientists from the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge say that a slow moving human who does not approach the nest too closely, is not viewed as a threat by penguins. The earlier findings have been used to partly explain the 20 per cent drop in populations of certain types of penguins near tourist sites.  However, tour operators have continued to insist that their activities do not adversely affect wildlife in Antarctica, saying they encourage non-disruptive behavior in tourists, and that the decline in penguin numbers is caused by other factors. Amanda Nimon of the Scott Polar Research Institute spent three southern hemisphere summers at Cuverville Island in Antarctica studying penguin behavior towards humans.  \\"A nesting penguin will react very differently to a person rapidly and closely approaching the nest,\\" says Nimon.  \\"First they exhibit large and prolonged heart rate changes and then they often flee the nest leaving it open for predators   to fly in and remove eggs or chicks.\\"  The artificial egg, specially for the project, monitored both the parent who had been 'disturbed' when the egg was placed in the nest and the other parent as they both took it in turns to guard the nest. However, Boris Culik, who monitored the Adelie penguins, believes that Nimon's findings do not invalidate his own research.  He points out that species behave differently - and Nimon's work was with Gentoo penguins.  Nimon and her colleagues believe that Culik's research was methodologically flawed because the monitoring of penguins' responses needed capturing and restraining the birds and fitting them with...

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  and the situation: Greg is an environmental scientist. He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities.  Answer the following question: In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Time B would have more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere compared to Time A. The reasoning behind this conclusion lies in the differences between the two time periods and human activities that have an impact on the carbon cycle. Time A is set in the year one thousand, during which the use of fossil fuels was not as prevalent. Human societies primarily relied on agricultural activities, and the primary sources of energy were wind, water, and animal labor. Industrialization was yet to take place, and the overall human population was significantly lower than in Time B. Consequently, the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities was minimal. Natural processes, such as plant respiration, decay, and volcanic activities, contributed to the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, these levels were considerably balanced by carbon dioxide absorption through natural sinks, such as photosynthesis, ocean uptake, and other biological processes. On the other hand, Time B is set in the year two thousand, during which the world was heavily reliant on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy sources were essential to power industrial processes, transportation, electricity generation, and various domestic and commercial applications. The combustion of fossil fuels releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the global human population increased dramatically during this period, resulting in greater consumption of resources and higher levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to the large-scale extraction and burning of fossil fuels, other factors also contributed to higher carbon dioxide emissions in Time B. For example, widespread deforestation and land-use changes reduced the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The rising demand for agricultural land and urbanization amplified these effects, further influencing the global carbon cycle. In conclusion, more carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere in Time B compared to Time A. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during Time B is primarily driven by human activities linked to the widespread use of fossil fuels, industrialization, and associated land-use changes. These factors have significantly impacted the natural carbon cycle, leading to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and contributing to the global climate change phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.

Article:","output":"Title: Firefighting at Loch Ness: An Unrelenting Battle Against Rural Grass Fire Introduction In a dramatic overnight operation that lasted a grueling 11 hours, fire crews fought tooth and nail to contain a rural grass fire near the iconic Loch Ness. Home to the mythical Loch Ness Monster, these ordinarily tranquil surroundings were disrupted by the relentless blaze, posing a significant risk to the local ecosystem, wildlife, and nearby communities. The Incident As darkness fell on the evening of the fire, emergency services were alerted to the rapidly escalating situation near the banks of Loch Ness. The rural grass fire had quickly grown out of control, fueled by a combination of dry vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, and gusty wind conditions. With little time to spare, a fleet of fire crews were dispatched to the scene, ready to tackle the ferocious flames. The Challenges and Response Given the remote location and limited access routes to the site of the fire, fighting the blaze posed a unique set of challenges for the emergency services in attendance. As the clock ticked and the fire continued to devour everything in its path, firefighters employed a variety of strategies to quell the flames, including the use of aerial water drops, controlled backburning techniques, and the construction of firebreaks to prevent further spread. Throughout the course of the night, fire crews battled tirelessly against the elements, often having to navigate thick smoke and uneven terrain to extinguish hotspots and flare-ups. In addition to the inherent dangers associated with such an intense operation, fatigue and exhaustion undoubtedly took their toll on the crews as their efforts stretched across 11 long hours. Community Impact The consequences of the fire reverberated far beyond the site of the blaze itself, with concerns raised about the potential damage done to the local ecosystem. As a popular tourist destination, Loch Ness and its surrounding area support a vibrant community with numerous businesses reliant on the steady stream of visitors each year. The fire raised fears that the beauty of this idyllic landscape might suffer long-term consequences, potentially affecting the community's primary source of income. The region's abundant wildlife was also at risk, with the rapidly spreading flames threatening the habitats of numerous species native to the area. Efforts were made to evacuate any distressed and injured animals encountered during the firefighting operation, in a bid to reduce the impact on local fauna. Reflecting on the Incident As the dawn broke and the fire was finally contained, the resilience, dedication, and courage of the fire crews involved came to the forefront. Their unwavering commitment to combating the blaze ensured that a potentially devastating situation was kept under control, preventing further damage to the surrounding areas. While detailed assessments are still underway to determine the full extent of the damage wrought by the fire, early indications suggest that the quick response and persevering efforts of the emergency services helped to avert a more significant ecological disaster. As the community begins the process of recovery and regrowth, attention now turns to implementing strategies to mitigate the risk of future rural grass fires in the region. In conclusion, the overnight battle near Loch Ness serves as a potent reminder of the tireless work carried out by fire crews, who risk their lives to protect not only lives and property, but also the stunning natural landscapes that make our world so unique. Their determination and skill in the face of adversity are testament to the undying commitment exhibited by emergency services personnel all around the globe."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873.

After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officerâs candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesnât quite understand Maxâs motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant. Jan gives Paulie the lowdown on life in 26D, and that life for the enlisted at Tetley Field is all work, work, work. With school, Jan relays a story she heard where once youâre over 21 years of age, your brain doesnât absorb the material taught anymore. Max comes by the bungalow surprised to see his wife there already. They have a loving reunion. The Luptons say goodbye to the Whartons, who can now have a proper reunion. Max and Paulie discuss their upcoming life. Paulie wants to be just like all the other army wives living in the complex. With his difficulties in school, Max is concerned if he is doing the right thing for himself, for the country and for the...

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet .  - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some  such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya  developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.  - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27).  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).  - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.     What is the relationship between 'reull vallis' and 'hellas quadrangle'?

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

Select from: (I). Line a cardboard box with clean cutting board and place ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, add a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm.; (II). Line a cardboard box with clean towels and place ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, add a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm.;","output":"Between the two options provided, option (II) which involves lining a cardboard box with clean towels and placing the ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, with a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm, makes more sense in accomplishing the goal of preparing a container to take care of ducklings. Allow me to detail the reasoning behind this choice and provide a step-by-step guide to creating a safe and comfortable environment for the ducklings: 1. Choose a suitable container: Select a container that is large enough to accommodate the ducklings' growth. A plastic storage container with high sides, a large cardboard box, or even a small plastic swimming pool can be suitable options depending on the number of ducklings you have. 2. Line the container: Line the container with clean towels or non-slip mats instead of the cutting board mentioned in option (I). Towels and mats provide a softer surface, are more absorbent which will keep the container dry, and are safer for the ducklings to walk on without slipping. These are crucial factors in ensuring the ducklings' comfort and preventing injuries. 3. Place the ducklings in the container when appropriate: It is essential to place the ducklings into the designed box about 24 hours after they're born. This gives the ducklings time to dry off and adapt to their new environment. 4. Provide warmth: Add a 100-watt bulb or heat lamp inside the box to keep the ducklings warm. Since their body temperature should be maintained at around 90-92 degrees Fahrenheit (32-33 degrees Celsius) in their first week, a heat source is vital. Make sure the heat source is secure and does not pose a fire risk, and ensure that there is a cooler area within the container so the ducklings can move away from the heat if needed. 5. Monitor the temperature: Gradually reduce the temperature inside the container by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) per week until they can handle the ambient temperature or are ready to be placed outdoors. Monitoring the temperatures ensures the ducklings' comfort and maintains their overall health. 6. Provide water and food: Supply a shallow dish of water for the ducklings, deep enough for them to submerge their bills but not deep enough for them to climb in and get soaked. Maintain a consistent supply of high-quality, non-medicated, waterfowl-specific feed. Place the water and food dishes in separate areas of the container, with the food dish located in the cooler area to prevent spoilage. 7. Keep the container clean: Regularly change the lining of the container and keep the area free from droppings or spilled food and water. This helps maintain a hygienic environment for the ducklings and helps reduce the risk of illness. 8. Provide a safe space: As the ducklings grow, they will become more active. Ensure that their container remains a safe space by monitoring their movements and adjusting the container size or sides as needed. Also, gradually introduce them to outdoor spaces while closely supervising them. By following these steps, Option (II) will be more successful in providing a comfortable, safe, and nurturing environment for the ducklings to grow and thrive in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hillary Clinton: Her Notable Moments\\"","output":"Title: Hillary Clinton: Her Notable Moments Introduction Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton, born on October 26, 1947, has been a significant figure in American politics for decades and remains a trailblazer for women in politics. As First Lady, a senator, Secretary of State, and a two-time presidential candidate, Clinton has demonstrated great resilience and determination, which has earned her admiration and critiques alike. This article delves into some of the most notable moments in her political career, showcasing her impact, achievements, and the challenges she has faced. 1. Her early political life Clinton's political journey began early in her life. As a student at Wellesley College, she served as president of the Young Republicans Club. However, her political leanings shifted during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, which led her to become a Democrat. She later attended Yale Law School, where she met her future husband, Bill Clinton.  2. First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton assumed the role of First Lady when her husband, Bill Clinton, was elected president in 1993. During her time in the White House, she became one of the most active and ambitious First Ladies in history. Her high-profile involvement in policy-making and administration was highlighted by her efforts to reform the healthcare system, with the ultimate goal of providing affordable healthcare to all Americans. Though the plan, dubbed \\"Hillarycare,\\" ultimately failed to be passed by Congress, it laid the groundwork for future healthcare reform efforts, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). 3. Senator from New York In 2000, Hillary Clinton made history by becoming the first First Lady to seek and win public office, being elected as a U.S. Senator from New York. During her tenure in the Senate from 2001 to 2009, Clinton built a reputation as a diligent legislator, championing issues such as job creation, access to education, and national security. Notably, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and was particularly dedicated to addressing the needs of the first responders and victims of the September 11 attacks.  4. 2008 presidential campaign Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2007. Despite her solid experience and grassroots support, she ultimately lost to Barack Obama after a long and competitive primary race, which became one of the major milestones in her political career. Demonstrating her commitment to the Democratic Party, Clinton wholeheartedly endorsed Obama and played an active role in his campaign, further cementing her position as a political leader. 5. Secretary of State under President Obama Following the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama nominated Clinton to become the United States Secretary of State, a role she served in from 2009 to 2013. In this position, Clinton played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy during Obama's presidency. She established diplomatic initiatives like the \\"pivot to Asia\\" and promoted human rights and gender equality around the world. One of her most notable achievements was her role in implementing strong economic sanctions on Iran, which eventually led to the Iran nuclear deal. 6. Benghazi attack and subsequent investigation Following the tragic 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which led to the death of four Americans, Clinton faced harsh criticism and numerous investigations from her political opponents. While the investigations found no evidence of wrongdoing on her part, the events surrounding the Benghazi attack remained an enduring political controversy and a major challenge for her during her 2016 presidential campaign. 7. 2016 presidential campaign Hillary Clinton's second run for the presidency in 2016 was groundbreaking in many ways. She made history by becoming the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party. Her campaign focused on progressive policy proposals, such as criminal justice reform, raising the minimum wage, and affordable healthcare expansion. Ultimately, she won the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost the electoral college to her Republican opponent Donald Trump, marking a shocking and unexpected end to her presidential aspirations. 8. Post-election life After the 2016 election, Clinton remained active in public life, engaging in philanthropy, delivering speeches, and publishing books. Her memoir, \\"What Happened,\\" chronicles the events, challenges, and personal reflections from her perspective during the contentious election. Furthermore, she has been vocal in supporting Democratic candidates in the subsequent elections and advocating for various social and political issues. Conclusion Throughout her political career, Hillary Clinton has seen significant wins, losses, and controversies. From being a trailblazer for women in politics to facing setbacks in her political journey, her resilience and determination have left an indelible mark on American politics. Regardless of one's political affiliations or views, there is no denying that Hillary Clinton has played a key role in shaping progressive values and policies for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne \\"perverters of the American dream\\", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless.

Please answer the following question: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light.

Q:Process:  - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate changes dramatically happens, how will it affect less affected rain to fall.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation assumption of a dramatic climate change could indeed have both direct and indirect impacts on the process, potentially leading to less acidic rain falling. Here are some possible effects: 1. Direct Effects on Emission Sources: The key driver of acid rain is the human industry emitting chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. A dramatic change in the climate could affect the efficiency or operation of these industries. For instance, it could lead to stricter regulations on emissions to mitigate climate change, which would reduce the number of chemical compounds released into the air. Similarly, a significant shift in temperature could impact the energy consumption patterns, hence the pollution generated. Higher temperatures might reduce the demand for heating oil and coal, leading to fewer emissions, while lower temperatures could increase the need for heat and subsequently increase emissions. 2. Altered Atmospheric Chemistry: Acid rain is produced when chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with elements in the atmosphere. Climate change can modify these reactions. It could change the temperature, humidity, and amount of sunlight present, which can all affect how quickly and effectively these reactions occur. Therefore, alterations to the atmospheric chemistry can result in less acid rain. 3. Precipitation Patterns: Climate change can dramatically alter global precipitation patterns resulting in either more or less rain in general. If there's less rainfall overall, there will be less acid rain too. However, it's worth noting that even though less acid rain might fall, the rain that does fall might be more acidic if the concentration of pollutants is still high. 4. Effects on Natural Carbon Sinks: In addition to industrial sources, acid rain is also affected by the balance of naturally occurring carbon sinks like trees and soil. As climate change progresses, natural carbon sinks might decrease due to deforestation or changes in soil composition. This could result in less acid rain, since these carbon sinks help neutralize acid components in the rain. 5. Wind Patterns and Dispersion: Climate change can influence wind patterns, which play a critical role in the dispersion of pollutants over vast distances. If there is a shift causing pollutants to be dispersed over a greater area, the acidity of the resulting rain within a localized area might decline. Based on these factors, it's clear that dramatic climate change could indeed have an impact on the amount of acid rain that falls. It's important to note, however, that these effects could be positive or negative. While some changes might reduce the amount of acid rain, others might increase it or make it more concentrated. Therefore, while the perturbation hypothesis you suggested could cause less affected rain to fall, it's not a guaranteed outcome. Comprehensive research and climate modelling would be necessary to make more specific predictions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Michael Joseph Piazza (; born September 4, 1968) is an American former professional baseball catcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1992 to 2007. He played most notably for the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, while also having brief stints with the Florida Marlins, San Diego Padres, and Oakland Athletics. A 12-time All-Star and 10-time Silver Slugger Award winner at catcher, Piazza produced strong offensive numbers at his position; in his career, he recorded 427 home runs--a record 396 of which were hit as catcher--along with a .308 batting average and 1,335 runs batted in (RBIs). Piazza was drafted by the Dodgers in the 1988 MLB draft as a favor from Tommy Lasorda to Piazza's father. Context: After his father asked Lasorda to select Piazza as a favor, the Miami-Dade Community College student was drafted by the Dodgers in the 62nd round of the 1988 MLB amateur draft as the 1,390th player picked overall. Lasorda asked Piazza to give up his first base position and learn how to catch to improve his chances of reaching the major leagues, and helped him attend a special training camp for catchers in the Dominican Republic. Piazza became an excellent hitter, especially for a catcher. His MLB debut came with the Dodgers on September 1, 1992, against the Chicago Cubs. He drew a walk in his first plate appearance and then doubled to deep center field in his first official at-bat, against Mike Harkey of the Cubs. He hit his first home run on September 12, 1992, against Steve Reed of the San Francisco Giants. He only appeared in 21 games that season, hitting .232.  He won the NL MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1993 after appearing in 149 games, hitting .318, slugging 35 home runs, and driving in 112 RBIs. He was also selected to the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first of 10 consecutive (and 12 total) All-Star appearances. Until Joc Pederson passed him in 2015, Piazza's 18 home runs before the All Star break was a Dodgers' rookie record.  In 1996, Piazza hit .336 with 36 home runs and 105 RBIs, finishing second in MVP voting, behind Ken Caminiti.  Piazza's best season with the Dodgers was 1997, when he hit .362, with 40 home runs, 124 RBIs, an on-base percentage of .431, and a slugging percentage of .638. He finished second in voting MVP for the second consecutive season, behind Larry Walker. Question: Did he receive any other recognition besides MVP?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Michael Joseph Piazza received several other recognitions and accolades throughout his career besides the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award consideration. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Rookie of the Year Award: Piazza won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award in 1993, an outstanding achievement for a player in his debut season. He showcased an impressive performance, hitting .318 with 35 home runs and 112 runs batted in (RBIs). 2. All-Star Selections: Piazza was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game 12 times during his career, with 10 consecutive appearances from 1993 to 2002. This recognition highlights his consistent high-level performance as one of the best players in the league throughout his career. 3. Silver Slugger Awards: Piazza received the Silver Slugger Award 10 times during his career, an honor given to the best offensive players at each position in both the American League (AL) and National League (NL). Winning the award 10 times at the catcher position highlights his exceptional abilities and strong offensive numbers throughout his career. 4. Hall of Fame Induction: Piazza was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. This prestigious honor is given to players who have made significant contributions to the sport and achieved exceptional success throughout their careers. In summary, Michael Piazza's impressive career not only included MVP considerations, but also multiple recognitions such as the Rookie of the Year Award, All-Star selections, Silver Slugger Awards, and a Hall of Fame induction, which all solidify his legacy as one of the greatest catchers and offensive players in Major League Baseball history."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment.

For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.  - The Cyprinidae are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). Also commonly called the \\"carp family\\", or \\"minnow family\\", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. The family name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"kyprînos\\" (, \\"carp\\").  - A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.

When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do? The phrase 'to face the music\\" was first used by   _  . A) all the Americans B) the American writer James Fennimore cooper C) some American actors D) the American orchestra","output":"The phrase \\"to face the music\\" was first used by C) some American actors.

In both cases, the individuals had to confront an unpleasant or nerve-wracking situation, knowing they had no choice but to go through with it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This basic story provides the jumping off point for Theroux's satire of American culture. Hypothesis: Laura Warholic in essence helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Laura Warholic in essence helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture from the given context. The context mentions that the 2007 novel \\"Laura Warholic; or, The Sexual Intellectual\\" by Alexander Theroux focuses on the relationship between Eugene Eyestones, the writer of an advice column called \\"The Sexual Intellectual,\\" and his editor's ex-wife, Laura Warholic, whom Eyestones pities more than likes. The interactions and dynamic between these two characters form the basis of the satire, serving as a starting point for a broader critique of American culture. To elaborate, Theroux's novel exposes various aspects of American society through the relationship between the book's central characters, Eugene and Laura. The title itself hints at both the intellectual and the sexual aspects of their relationship, creating an ironic commentary on the complex dynamics between the two. Eugene's occupation as an advice columnist allows Theroux to delve into a variety of societal issues, including the effects of contemporary media, moral dilemmas, and the complexities of human relationships. Laura serves as the catalyst for Eugene's exploration into these societal concerns, as her presence in his life compels him to both continuously scrutinize and offer guidance on these topics. Furthermore, Laura is a representation of modern American society, with her flaws and contradictions amplifying the satire of the cultural critique. The initial sympathy Eugene feels towards her eventually transforms into a sense of frustration, reflecting the novel's ongoing exploration of different aspects of American culture. In summary, the hypothesis that Laura Warholic helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture can be drawn from the context. As the titular character, Laura Warholic's relationship with Eugene Eyestones embodies the novel's central themes, allowing Theroux to launch an exploration of various aspects of contemporary American society. The novel uses the interplay between the characters to expose and critique cultural norms, highlighting the issues and complexities that exist within this social landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending.

Samantha and Amy were best friends and neighbors, living in a small yet charming cul-de-sac. Their house windows faced each other, making it easier for the two friends to communicate and keep an eye on each other's pets while they were away. Samantha's rat, affectionately named Remy, was quite the unusual pet compared to others in the neighborhood. Yet, Samantha adored this little creature with all her heart. Remy was an intelligent and empathetic pet, sensing his owner's emotions and always comforting her when she needed it. His curious nature led him to explore every nook and cranny of Samantha's home, mapping it all in his tiny rat brain. Amy's dog, a beautiful golden retriever named Daisy, was her pride and joy. Daisy was friendly, loyal, and loved to play fetch in the park. Amy took Daisy on long walks, hikes, and even outdoor movie nights. They were truly inseparable and had formed an incredible bond over the years. Amy considered Daisy not just a pet but a member of her family. One sunny afternoon, Samantha had to leave for a business trip and asked Amy to take care of Remy during her absence. Amy, being the good friend that she was, agreed without hesitation. Samantha provided Amy with all the necessary instructions on taking care of Remy and prepared a comfy place for him in her friend's house. As days went by, Remy started to find his new environment fascinating. He accidentally bumped into Daisy and, to his surprise, Daisy didn't look at him as prey. The gentle-hearted Daisy took a liking to the tiny rat, and they soon became friends, playing and exploring Amy's home together. During their escapades, Remy and Daisy discovered they could learn from each other. Remy's ability to navigate tight spaces and reach hidden areas meant Daisy could fetch long-lost toys and items while also locating secret treats in Amy's kitchen. On the other hand, Daisy's ability to reach high places and her persistence in solving small problems inspired Remy to venture beyond his comfort zone. As Samantha returned from her business trip, Amy excitedly shared the incredible friendship that had blossomed between Remy and Daisy. Samantha was thrilled that her rat and Amy's dog shared a unique and beautiful bond. This development further strengthened the connection between the two friends, as they now witnessed their pets' relationships mirroring their own. The neighborhood would often see Samantha and Amy walking side by side, with Daisy calmly strolling along and Remy perched on her back, observing the world from a new perspective. Both Remy and Daisy showed others that even unlikely friendships could be touching and exceptionally strong. As time went on, Samantha and Amy's houses became a sanctuary for their wonderful pets, and occasionally for neighboring pets too. Their homes were where love, compassion, and an appreciation for the eclectic nature of relationships truly flourished.

Given the following passage  \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\",  answer the following question.

Both sentences indicate that Holmes is originally from Sydney and attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Here is a detailed analysis of the sentences and their similarities: 1. \\"Originally from Sydney, Holmes attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.\\" This sentence begins with the phrase \\"Originally from Sydney,\\" which acts as an adjective modifying Holmes. It tells us that Holmes' origins are in Sydney. The main clause of the sentence, \\"Holmes attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra,\\" shares the information about Holmes' attendance at the sports institute in Canberra. 2. \\"Holmes, who is originally from Sydney, attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.\\" The second sentence also provides the same information about Holmes' origin and attendance at the sports institute but is structured differently. In this case, the phrase \\"who is originally from Sydney\\" is placed between commas and serves as a relative clause. This relative clause is used to give additional information about Holmes, specifying his origins in Sydney. The main clause remains the same, presenting the information about Holmes' attendance at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move.

Information:  - Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria found in various environments that forms colonies composed of filaments of moniliform cells in a gelatinous sheath.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Glomeromycota (informally glomeromycetes) is one of seven currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the roots or thalli (e.g. in bryophytes) of land plants. \\"Geosiphon pyriformis\\" forms an endocytobiotic association with \\"Nostoc\\" cyanobacteria, and is the only member of the Glomeromycota known not to form arbuscular mycorrhiza in association with plants. AM formation has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are symbionts with land plants (\\"Nostoc\\" in the case of \\"Geosiphon\\") for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.  - An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (plural \\"mycorrhizae\\" or \\"mycorrhizas\\", a.k.a. \\"endomycorrhiza\\", \\"AM fungi\\", or AMF) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the roots of a vascular plant.  Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.  - The Diversisporales are an order of generally hypogeous ( underground ) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within the division Glomeromycota . Many have vesicles for energy storage , or auxiliary cells . Species produce a wide range of spore types , hence the name .  - Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that are non-vascular plants, namely the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The defining features of bryophytes are that their life cycles are dominated by the gametophyte stage, that their sporophytes are unbranched and that they do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin, although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water. Bryophytes are usually considered to be a paraphyletic group and not a natural (monophyletic) group, although some studies have produced contrary results. Regardless of their status, the name is convenient and remains in use as an informal collective term. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores. The term \\"bryophyte\\" comes from Greek , \\"bryon\\", \\"tree-moss, oyster-green\\" +   \\"phyton\\" \\"plant\\".  - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.

Article: One answer to the question of land shortage was suggested by an organization some years ago. A city was to be built at sea, housing 30,000 people. The suggestion was to shape the city like a harbor .The outer wall of the harbor would stand on steel columns resting on the sea-bed. Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete  and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies. People could also travel to the mainland by motorboat or water plane.

Q:Process: - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets - The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products.  Question: suppose more turned into ingots happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more aluminum is turned into ingots, it will have a more significant effect on the recycling of aluminum cans. This is because an increase in the production of ingots directly correlates to the amount of recycled aluminum available for use in manufacturing new products, specifically aluminum cans in this case. The perturbation mentioned in the question affects the second effect in the following ways: 1. More ingots production leads to increased availability of recycled aluminum: When more aluminum cans are melted into ingots, it means that a higher percentage of the aluminum waste collected has been recycled and processed into usable raw material. This means there will be more recycled aluminum available to be turned into new aluminum products like cans, reducing the need for producing aluminum from raw materials. 2. Positive environmental impact: Recycling aluminum conserves resources and energy, as it requires significantly less energy to recycle aluminum compared to producing it from raw materials such as bauxite. This reduced energy consumption leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, thus positively impacting the environment. Consequently, an increase in the production of ingots from recycled aluminum cans enhances the overall environmental benefits of the recycling process. 3. Economic benefits: In addition to the environmental benefits, recycling aluminum is also economically efficient, as the cost of producing aluminum from recycled materials is lower than the cost of producing it from raw materials. As more ingots are produced from recycled aluminum cans, it creates more economic incentives for industries to invest further in recycling, leading to more capacity expansion in aluminum recycling facilities. This will enable the process to handle more aluminum cans effectively, hence increasing the overall recycling rate. 4. More aluminum cans being recycled leads to more demand for recycling facilities: As more aluminum cans are turned into ingots, it creates a need for more recycling facilities to process and recycle the large volume of aluminum cans generated daily. This increase in recycling capacity will accommodate and process more aluminum cans to be recycled, contributing to the growth of the recycling industry as a whole and helping the aluminum industry transition to a more circular economy-based model. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more aluminum cans being turned into ingots directly leads to a greater effect on aluminum cans recycling, as it increases the overall availability of recycled aluminum for new product manufacturing, and enhances the environmental and economic benefits of recycling aluminum. These factors together contribute to an increase in the capacity and effectiveness of recycling facilities, ultimately leading to more aluminum cans being recycled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple?  Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Premise: \\"7 million VSL is 163,000, annualized assuming EPA's guideline value of a 3 percent discount rate, or 270,000, annualized assuming OMB's guideline value of a 7 percent discount rate.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The epa has a guideline value of a 3% discount rate. \\" true?","output":"Based on the premise provided, it is indeed accurate to say that \\"The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has a guideline value of a 3% discount rate.\\" To better understand this statement and its implications, it's essential to break down the information from the premise and evaluate it accordingly. The premise refers to a \\"7 million VSL (Value of Statistical Life),\\" which is an estimate of the financial value society is willing to pay to reduce the risk of a fatality by one. In this case, the VSL is stated to be worth 163,000 a year, based on the EPA's guideline value of a 3% discount rate. The same VSL is also worth 270,000 a year under the OMB's (Office of Management and Budget) guideline value of a 7% discount rate. Discount rates are crucial in determining the present value of future costs and benefits, as they help quantify the time preferences of individuals and organizations in evaluating projects or policies. Higher discount rates lead to lower present values, making future benefits and costs less significant than immediate ones. Conversely, lower discount rates lead to higher present values, emphasizing the importance of future benefits and costs for decision making. Taking this into account, the EPA's 3% discount rate reflects a relatively lower time preference for the agency, highlighting its consideration for the long-term consequences of projects and policies on the environment and public health, as opposed to the more substantial short-term gains sought by OMB's 7% discount rate. In conclusion, it is true that based on the given premise, \\"The EPA has a guideline value of a 3% discount rate.\\" It reflects the agency's consideration of long-term environmental and health impacts in decision-making and serves as a critical parameter when evaluating the Value of Statistical Life and other cost-benefit assessments."},{"instruction":"What are Fiddler and Fifer doing when the Wolf attacks them?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Practical Pig, Fiddler Pig and Fifer Pig are three brothers who build their own houses with bricks, sticks and straw respectively. Practical Pig warns his brothers to build their house with \\"War Savings Certificate\\" bricks so that the house will be a solid defence against the marauding Wolf. Fifer and Fiddler ignore him and continue to play, singing \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\". As they are singing, the Big Bad Wolf in Nazi swastika regalia, attacks the two spendthrifts, and blows Fifer's straw house down. Fifer manages to escape and hides at Fiddler's stick house but the Wolf also blows it down. The two pigs run and hide at Practical's brick house. The Wolf then tries to blow down the strong brick house (losing his clothing in the process), but is unable to make much progress as the bricks have made a strong foundation. Finally, Practical Pig chases the wolf away in a flurry of bricks that unerringly hit the Nazi marauder in his rear. The three pigs then sing \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\" but with the caution that their house has to be in order to keep the wolf away.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options:  A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them  B. not enough information  C. when one is able to acquire produce in bulk  D. after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","output":"A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"instruction":"What is the last name of the person who suffered a heart attack at a concert after singing her hit song \\"Pata Pata\\"?

Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising.

Political affiliation: Brianne Nadeau is a Democratic politician, which means she is a member of the Democratic Party and likely shares their political values and ideologies. 2. Location: She is based in Washington, D.C., which is the capital city of the United States. 3. Current role: She is a member of the Council of the District of Columbia. The Council is the legislative branch of the local government of Washington, D.C., responsible for enacting laws and managing the city's budget. 4. Represented area: Nadeau represents Ward 1, one of the eight political divisions in Washington, D.C. Each ward elects a member to the Council of the District of Columbia to represent their interests. 5. Date of taking office: She took office on January 2, 2015, which means she has been serving as a Councilmember for over six years. 6. Election details: To secure her position as a Councilmember, Nadeau had to win in two separate contests - the Democratic Party primary and the general election in 2014. 7. Opponent in the primary election: Brianne Nadeau defeated Jim Graham, another Democratic politician who was previously occupying the Council seat for Ward 1, in the Democratic Party primary for the position in 2014.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"okay you too  bye-bye\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" and the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that\\" appear to have no direct logical correlation between them. Entailment in logic means that the truth of one statement (the premise) necessitates the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). Here's a breakdown of how that looks in this context: The premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" is a common, casual valediction or closing statement for a conversation. It carries no inherent negativity or prohibition, so it doesn't inherently imply any form of refusal or negation. On the other hand, \\"No, don't do that\\" is a clear negation or protest. It's a phrase that denotes disagreement, refusal or a request to halt some form of action. In this context, it's crucial to note that the above two statements could be part of a conversation but they don't necessarily entail one another. For entailment to exist, there should be a specific, logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis such that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. However, in this case, the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that\\" could be completely unrelated to the premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\".  The premise does not provide enough information or context for us to understand whether the person being addressed is about to engage in something that may require a protest or negation. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not logically guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. It is entirely possible for someone to say \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" and not proceed with \\"No, don't do that\\".  In conclusion, based on the provided premise and the proposed hypothesis, this premise does not entail the hypothesis. Even if “okay you too bye-bye” is true, it doesn't logically necessitate that \\"No, don't do that\\" is also true. Each statement exists independently of the other and can be valid or true under different circumstances. The premise does not set up a condition for the hypothesis to be valid or invalid, so they do not have entailment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process is the elimination of the synthesized urea, as well as other waste products and toxins, from the body through the circulatory system to the kidneys, where they are eventually excreted in the form of urine. To better understand this entire process, let's briefly review the main functions mentioned and then discuss the final step in more detail: 1. Blood filtration: The liver filters blood from the digestive tract, purifying it from toxins and harmful substances. This helps maintain the overall health and balance of the body. 2. Bile production: The liver produces bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine when needed. 3. Blood plasma proteins: The liver is responsible for producing proteins that are crucial components of blood plasma, such as albumin and clotting factors. These proteins play essential roles in maintaining blood volume and pressure, as well as blood clotting. 4. Glucose to glycogen conversion: The liver helps regulate blood sugar levels by converting excess glucose into glycogen, a storage form of glucose that can be later broken down and released when the body needs energy. 5. Ammonia to urea conversion: The liver detoxifies ammonia, a toxic byproduct produced from the breakdown of proteins, by converting it into a less toxic compound called urea. The last step of the process - elimination of urea and other waste products: After the liver has completed its various functions, including converting ammonia to urea, the newly synthesized urea is released into the bloodstream. The blood carrying urea and other waste products is transported to the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in filtering and purifying the blood, removing excess water, electrolytes, and waste products, including urea, from the bloodstream. This filtering process occurs in structures called nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidneys. The waste products and excess water filtered out of the blood in the nephrons then form urine. This urine is then collected in the renal pelvis, which leads to the ureters that transport it down to the urinary bladder. The bladder stores the urine until it's released from the body during the process of urination. In summary, the liver is an essential organ with various vital functions, including detoxification, metabolism regulation, and blood purification. The final step of the process, after completing its main roles, is the elimination of waste products, such as urea and toxins, from the body through the circulatory system and kidneys, followed by their excretion in the form of urine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\".

Article: How to Study Smarter, Not Harder Here are some of our favorite study tips that will help any student study smarter, not harder: Recite As You Study Reciting--saying things out loud should first take place as you read through each paragraph or section. Test yourself. This will help you to understand as well as learn faster because it is more active than reading or listening. It will also help you to notice your mistakes and the topics you have trouble understanding. Take Fuller Notes Notes should be in your own words, brief and clear. They should be tidy and easy to read. Writing notes will help you better than just underlining as you read, since it forces you to rewrite ideas in your own words. Study the Middle The best time to review is soon after you've learned something. You are more likely to remember the material at the beginning and the end of the lesson, so make sure you focus on the middle when you review. Sleep On It Study before going to bed, unless you are very tired. It's easier to remember material you've just learned after sleeping than after an equal period of daytime activity, because your brain continues to think even after you've fallen asleep. Combine Memory and Understanding There are two ways to remember: by memorizing and by understanding. Multiplication tables, telephone numbers, and math formulas are better learned by rote. Ideas are best learned by understanding. The more ways you have to think about an idea, the more meaning it will have; the more meaningful the learning, the better you can remember it. Pay attention to similarities in ideas and concepts, and then try to understand how they fit in with things you already know. Never be satisfied with anything less than a completely clear understanding of what you are reading. If you are not able to follow the thought, go back to the place where you first got confused and try again. Question: When taking notes, you should   _   to better help you with reading.

The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site.

The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage.

Question: Given the following context:  Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation?  Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","output":"Based on the Laffer curve and the taxation policies implemented by West Germany and France after World War II, West Germany would likely have a higher labor supply in response to their taxation policies.  West Germany implemented a tax rate below the critical rate, as mentioned in your question. This means that their pro-capitalist governments chose to keep taxes at a relatively low level to encourage economic growth and investment. According to the Laffer curve, lower taxation rates can lead to increased labor supply, as individuals and businesses have higher incentives to work and earn income. This is because they can retain a larger portion of their earnings due to the lower taxation rate. Conversely, France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate under their pro-socialist governments. This would have the opposite effect on labor supply, as higher taxes can discourage individuals and businesses from working and investing, given that they are required to pay a larger portion of their income to the government in the form of taxes. As a result, this policy can lead to a decrease in labor supply and, ultimately, a decline in government revenue. In conclusion, given the taxation policies of both countries after World War II, West Germany would likely experience a higher labor supply in comparison to France, owing to their lower taxation rate. This can be supported by the Laffer curve, which illustrates the relationship between taxation rates and their effect on labor supply and government revenue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Explanation: In the given statement, \\"A woman is looking at something by the light of two bulbs,\\" it is clear that the woman is using some source of light (the two bulbs) to see something. Therefore, it logically follows that \\"The lady is looking at something by the light,\\" as the original statement implies that she is using light to see whatever it is she is looking at. The other two answers are incorrect because: 2). It is not necessary to say \\"it is not possible to tell\\" since the original statement clearly states that the woman is using light from the bulbs to see something. 3). Answer no is incorrect because the original statement verifies that she is using light to observe an object, making it illogical to claim that this does not follow from the given statement."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12 on their peacekeeping bases, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged. Human Rights Watch said the soldiers, relying on Somali intermediaries, have at times targeted women and girls who enter the bases through guarded gates seeking medical assistance or water. The New York-based group said it interviewed 21 women and girls since 2013 who described being sexually abused or sexually exploited by Burundian or Ugandan military personnel in two bases in Mogadishu. African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged (file picture) Ten separate incidents of sexual abuse, including rape and sexual assault, and 14 cases of sexual exploitation were documented during the period, the rights group said. Four of the rape cases and one sexual assault involved girls under 18. The youngest victim was a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a Ugandan soldier. Several women said the soldiers refused to wear condoms, causing the women to catch sexually transmitted infections as a result, according to the report. Several also described being slapped and beaten by the soldiers who forced them to have sex. According to the 71-page report, '\\"The Power These Men Have Over Us\\":. Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by African Union Forces in. Somalia,' only two out of the 21 women and girls interviewed filed a complaint with Somali or other authorities. One 15-year-old girl went to the Burundian contingent's base to get medicine for her sick mother late 2013, the report says. The African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, was deployed in 2007. Its uniformed force, which numbers more than 22,000, comes from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sierra Leone (file picture - there is no suggestion the soldiers pictured were involved in the abuse) A Somali interpreter told her to follow two Burundian soldiers to get medicine. They took her to a remote area and one of the soldiers raped her, Human Rights Watch said. 'First he ripped off my hijab and then he attacked me,' she is quoted saying. As she was leaving, the second Burundian soldier gave her 10, the report says. Human Rights Watch said all of the Somali women and girls interviewed were internal refugees from south-central Somalia. The human rights group urged troop-contributing countries, the African Union Mission in Somalia and donors to urgently address these abuses and strengthen procedures inside Somalia to seek justice. 'Some African Union soldiers have misused their positions of power to exploit Somalia's most vulnerable women and girls,' said Liesl Gerntholtz, women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. 'Somalia has many intractable problems, but the Somali and. AU leadership could end sexual exploitation and abuse by. pressing troop-sending countries to hold abusers responsible.' Somalia has been mired in chaos and conflict since the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991.

The herbs and chile flakes add flavor and may provide additional antimicrobial properties that can further extend the cheese's shelf life. The other option, using a glass container with limes and oranges, is not the best choice for preserving cheese.

Flowing water can erode both rocks and soil. You have already learned that materials can dissolve in water. With enough time, even rocks can be dissolved by water. This process happens really slowly. It may take over a million years to dissolve a rock. It doesnt matter how big the rock is. With enough time, flowing water can dissolve it. Moving water also has the ability to move small pieces of rock and soil. How can water move a rock? Doesnt it need energy? Of course, water gets its energy because it is moving. Moving water has kinetic energy. Things that have more energy can do more work. When water stops moving it will have no energy. It will no longer be able to move the rock and soil. When this happens the rock and soil will settle to the bottom of the calm water. Scientists call this process deposition.  Question: \\"What is it called when rock and soil settle to the bottom of calm water?\\" Answer: \\"Deposition\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.  The passage detailed the abilities of water - its ability to move and dissolve various materials, such as rocks and soil, as a result of its kinetic energy. It specified that when water stops moving and consequently loses its energy, it can no longer carry these materials. They then settle at the bottom of the calm water, a process which the passage explicitly identifies as \\"deposition\\".

It's kind of familiar territory and seemed a bit dated. The middle chapters were about linguistic, which were pretty interesting. After the end, the book seemed to lose what focus it had.The presentation is chopped up into small sections that don't always flow well (hence, the disjointed feel). It was frustrating to read and felt simplistic at times (as if the reader cannot keep up with an extensive analysis or something).TGHD is not terrible, but I've read better books on the subject.Not recommended. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses several issues with the book which contribute to their overall dissatisfaction. Firstly, they refer to the book's subject matter as \\"disjoined,\\" with the earliest parts focusing on biology and evolution, fields which they found to be outdated or at least not presented in a fresh or engaging way. This indicates that the reviewer found the beginning of the book to be lackluster, lacking new insights or valuable information. The reviewer does admit that there were portions they found interesting, specifically the ones concentrating on linguistics. However, this affirmative commentary is isolated and does not seem to significantly impact the overall perception.  Post this lone positive comment, the reviewer goes on to note that the book seemed directionless or lacking a clear focus. They also criticize the book's structure, specifically, the decision to divide it into small sections. They found the flow between these sections to be quite choppy, and this disorganization resulted in a disjointed reading experience.  The notion of the book being “simplistic” suggests the reviewer felt that the book might have been ‘dumbed down’ for readers, thus causing it to lose its depth or richness in content. They express frustration at what they view as a lack of intellectual challenge or engagement.  They conclude their review with the statement that \\"TGHD is not terrible, but I've read better books on the subject.\\" This implies that while they do not categorize the book as completely worthless or poorly written, it is, according to them, significantly outperformed by other books within the same subject area. Their stated non-recommendation, coupled with their various issues with the book's overall content and structure, is a clear indication of their negative sentiment toward the product.  As a summary, the reviewer’s dissatisfaction from the book stems from its disorganized presentation, lack of intellectual challenge or thought-provoking content, dated information and a sense that it lacked focus or overarching direction.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   One way to test a cause and effect hypothesis is to perform a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, two identical experiments are carried out side-by-side. In one of the experiments, the independent variable being tested is used, and in the other experiment, the control, the independent variable is not used.   Q: What type of experiment involves two identical experiments carried out side-by-side, with and without an independent variable?   A: Answer:","output":"A controlled experiment is the type of experiment that involves two identical experiments carried out side-by-side, with and without an independent variable. In a controlled experiment, the aim is to test a cause and effect hypothesis by isolating the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable while keeping all other factors constant. To achieve this, researchers design two parallel experiments: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group receives the independent variable, also known as the treatment or intervention, while the control group does not receive the independent variable, remaining in the same condition as before the experiment. This contrast allows researchers to directly compare the outcomes of both groups and evaluate the effect of the independent variable. In a controlled experiment, it is crucial to keep all other variables constant across both groups, ensuring that any differences in the outcomes can be attributed solely to the presence or absence of the independent variable. This is often achieved through random assignment, which helps to minimize the risk of confounding variables or biases affecting the results. Furthermore, controlled experiments may also be performed using a double-blind design, wherein both the participants and the researchers are unaware of which group is receiving the treatment. This minimizes the risk of experimenter bias and placebo effects, increasing the reliability and validity of the results. In conclusion, a controlled experiment is a type of experiment in which two identical experiments, with and without an independent variable, are carried out side-by-side. This design allows for the direct comparison of the two groups, enabling researchers to determine the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable while controlling for other factors that may influence the results."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Justice Minister David Ford introduced what he said were necessary cuts to payments to lawyers in May 2015. Defence lawyers have withdrawn from new criminal cases requiring legal aid in protest at the changes. The ongoing dispute has stalled about 800 cases due to be heard in the Crown Court. A two-day process aimed at resolving a stand-off, will take place within the next fortnight. It is understood that both sides have agreed on an English QC to act as mediator. Some solicitors' firms have also joined in the industrial action. Senior judges adjourned an ongoing court challenge to the new rules for legal aid fees in Northern Ireland after being informed of the development. Judicial review proceedings were launched by the Bar Council and the Law Society in a joint bid to have the new payment arrangements quashed. In November 2015, a High Court judge held that the rules do not provide fair pay to defence solicitors in some criminal cases. He also identified a breach in the impact assessment carried out as part of the reforms. However, despite declaring the decision making process unlawful in two areas, he declined to quash the rules. An appeal against his verdict was due to begin this week in front of three senior judges in Belfast. On Friday, following a suggestion put to the parties by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, it was confirmed that mediation is to take place. The Court of Appeal was told the Bar Council, Law Society and the Department of Justice have all signed up. On that basis, legal proceedings were put on hold. The judges also listed the case for a provisional three-day hearing in February, should the mediation prove unsuccessful. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a disagreement between the Justice Minister David Ford and lawyers over cuts to payments for legal aid cases. The lawyers are not happy with these cuts and stopped taking new cases that need legal aid, which has caused a delay in 800 cases.

( <<?>> ) has become one of the most popular TV shows. On the shows, the five fathers and their children traveled around China, riding camels through the western deserts, fishing on the east coast, and selling vegetables for their bus fare  home in southwestern Yunnan Province. One dad doesn't know how to do his daughter's hair, so some people try to help him. Another one must _ with his son for three days in the desert. Because the father can't cook, they only eat instant noodles . Why is Where Are We Going, Dad? so popular? Because it is about how Chinese parents look after their kids. The show makes modern parents think about what they should do with their kids. \\"In traditional Chinese culture, the father is strict and the mother is kind. But on the show, we see fathers who are much gentler  on their kids and more involved  in their upbringing \\" said Li Minyi, a professor of early childhood education. In the past, children were taught to obey their parents' wishes and look after them in their old age. But today Chinese parents increasingly realize that respecting their children's choices may be a better way to prepare them for modern society.

What was more unusual was the way in which he made his dream come true. After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons  to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee  of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined   1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \\"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \\" Question: Why couldn't Ted join the American Air Force?

We have to find out the value of \\"f\\" (that's what solve for f means) in the equation \\"17*f = 14*f\\".  To do that, we want to get \\"f\\" by itself on one side. So, let's first see how many \\"f\\"s we have on each side of the equation: On the left side, we have \\"17*f\\", which means 17 times f. On the right side, we have \\"14*f\\", which means 14 times f. Now, we want to make them equal by moving all the \\"f\\"s to one side. We can do that by subtracting one of these amounts from both sides. Let's subtract \\"14*f\\" from both sides of the equation: 17*f - 14*f = 14*f - 14*f This gives us a new equation: 3*f = 0 (\\"17*f - 14*f\\" is 3 times f, and \\"14*f - 14*f\\" is 0, because we took away exactly the same amount.) Now we have \\"3*f = 0\\". This means that 3 times f equals 0. But how many times do we have to multiply 3 with f to get 0?  Well, the only way that can happen is if f equals 0 because anything multiplied by 0 is 0. So, the answer is: f = 0 Great job! We solved it together!

He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life. I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone.

Please answer this question: who is the woman holding the scales of justice?","output":"The woman holding the scales of justice is often referred to as Lady Justice or Justitia, the Roman goddess of justice. The depiction of a woman holding the scales of justice serves as a symbol of the fair and impartial administration of the law. The image of Lady Justice appears around the world in courtrooms, government buildings, legal documents, and numerous other places related to the legal system. Lady Justice is usually portrayed as a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales and a double-edged sword. Each element in her portrayal carries significant symbolism: 1. The blindfold: This represents the idea that justice should be impartial and objective. The blindfold covers Lady Justice's eyes to symbolize that she does not discriminate based on wealth, power, social standing, or any other personal attributes. It conveys the principle that justice should be meted out fairly to all, without favoritism or prejudice. 2. The scales: The scales Lady Justice holds in her hand symbolize the weighing of evidence and the balancing of competing interests. When the scales are in equilibrium, it represents a just outcome where the rights and interests of the parties involved have been given proper consideration. In legal settings, this balance can refer to the fair treatment of the accused and the accuser or the plaintiff and the defendant. 3. The double-edged sword: The sword in Lady Justice's other hand represents the power and authority of the law. It suggests that justice can be swift and final, protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. The double-edged aspect of the sword also signifies that the law applies equally to all, and justice has the potential to cut both ways. Although Justitia has her origins in the Roman pantheon, her influence and symbolism can be traced back further to ancient Greece, where Themis and Dike were goddesses of justice and order. Themis, similar to Justitia, bore the scales of justice and represented divine law, while Dike, often portrayed with a sword, symbolized the concept of moral justice and order. Throughout centuries, the imagery of Lady Justice has evolved, incorporating various cultural and artistic elements. The blindfold, for instance, was not added to the iconic representation until the 16th century. Likewise, her portrayal has also been influenced by religious and philosophical concepts from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Today, Lady Justice remains a powerful and enduring symbol of the principles of fairness, impartiality, and the rule of law, inspiring confidence and trust in the legal systems all around the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was the first war crimes tribunal created since Nuremberg at the end of World War II. It has indicted 161 individuals, including senior politicians and military leaders. The BBC has been allowed unprecedented access to the inner workings of the tribunal. In the bowels of the building sits a heavy, six-lever metal door, probably bomb-proof. It harks back to the time when the place was owned by an insurance firm. The door used to be the entrance to the company's vault, where its most important documents and files were kept. Today the door is unnecessary but the vault has been turned into a series of Spartan holding cells, a place for the accused at the court to sit and meet their lawyers before going upstairs to the courts. Each cell has a small, simple table and two plastic chairs and every defendant has had access to the same basic facility. All except Slobodan Milosevic. Such was the media interest in the trial of the former Yugoslav leader that Paddy Gavin, the Irish carpenter in charge of the cells, was forced to create a small bedsit for the ex-president so he could arrive very early, ahead of the media. \\"We fitted it with a bed and a wardrobe and somewhere to write and a lamp,\\" he recalls. \\"All the furniture had to be screwed together and fixed to the floors and the walls.\\" A couple of floors above the vault sit the courts themselves.  The highest-profile current defendant is Radovan Karadzic, former leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including at Srebrenica, where more than 7,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys were murdered. But despite the seriousness of the charges, he has chosen to defend himself, an idea he got from watching Milosevic employ the same tactic during his trial. Mr Karadzic does get legal help however, and in a small cramped office sit eight young, eager, fresh-faced interns. Law students drawn from around the world, they are excited to be working on such a high-profile case. Cradling a signed photo of Mr Karadzic is one of the interns, 24-year-old Zygimantas Juska from Lithuania. \\"I met him and he seems really nice,\\" he says. \\"He knows a lot from his life and experience so he can provide a lot of valuable information to someone young like me. He's done a lot in his life.\\" Corralling that enthusiasm is Peter Robinson, a defence lawyer from San Francisco who is one of Mr Karadzic's legal representatives. He similarly describes the Bosnian Serb positively, talking of a \\"funny, personable, humble, grateful\\" man, but he acknowledges it is unlikely his client will ever be freed. \\"He may know in his heart [that he'll never be freed] but he's a real optimist... and I think he has some hope, maybe unrealistic, that some day he could be,\\" he said. Ranged against that hope are millions of pages of documents held behind the locked doors of the court's evidence vault. Stacked in neat brown cardboard boxes, they contain the horrors of the wars in the former Yugoslavia - the evidence of witnesses, the forensic material gathered on the ground, the transcripts of incendiary interviews given at the time. Bob Reid, a plain-speaking former Australian police officer who has worked here for nearly two decades, recalls carrying out much of the tribunal's early, grim investigative work. He said it was \\"chilling\\" to walk into the notorious Serbian detention camp, Omarska, with its torture chamber known as the White House, \\"where we knew terrible crimes had occurred\\". \\"The political elite, the police officers, the clergy - had all been put in there and none of them came out.  And [we] were still finding traces of blood.\\" It is little wonder he took particular delight in securing the capture of Mr Karadzic and his erstwhile military leader, Ratko Mladic.  \\"They were nice days, they were good days. There was one beer or two had in Belgrade.\\" While a lot of the evidence against Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic, whose trial is also under way, is on paper, it is the evidence of witnesses that make the trials come alive. Several witnesses, from either the defence or the prosecution side, can pass through the court each day. The tribunal has a particular section, the Witness Support Unit, that takes care of people who travel to the court. Some have been called to testify on several occasions, giving evidence in more than one trial, not just at The Hague but in courts in the former Yugoslavia. The whole experience can put severe pressure on the witnesses, says Helena Vranov Schoorl from the unit: \\"It's like they are stuck in the past. \\"They call it a bit of a testimony fatigue. As one of the witnesses said - once a witness, always a witness. The witnesses feel exhausted, especially if you are forced to live in the past.\\" The call of The Hague on those witnesses is reducing. The last trials are under way, with verdicts expected by the end of 2014, although appeals could mean the court continuing to operate for a couple of years after that. Despite the dozens of defendants and thousands of witnesses who have passed through this ground-breaking tribunal, many staff here remain befuddled as to what caused former neighbours to turn so viciously, so violently, on each other. They may never know - so they will simply continue to work towards trying to ensure that such brutality is never repeated.","output":"The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a place where important people who did bad things during a war got into trouble. The BBC got a special chance to look at what goes on in this court. In this building, there is a heavy door that used to be an entrance to a very important room when the building was owned by an insurance company. Now, that room is used for people who did wrong to meet their lawyers. Every person who did wrong got the same simple room, except one very important person named Slobodan Milosevic. Because a lot of people from TV and newspapers wanted to see him, he got a fancier room where he could spend time before the courtroom sessions. Another important person, Radovan Karadzic, is on trial, too. He is accused of really, really bad things, like hurting a lot of people. But he chose to defend himself, which means he talks in his own defense in the court, just like Milosevic did in his trial. But he has some help from young lawyers. There are lots and lots of papers that have details about all the bad things that happened during the war. Some of these papers are very scary to read because they tell about terrible things. There is also a special place in the court for people who saw bad things happen and are helping the court by telling what they saw.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8].

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Help as much as you can. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens...

Prison reform is politically unachievable Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"While it is true that there have been some efforts towards prison reform, the political landscape, coupled with other factors, have made large-scale and long-term reform challenging to achieve. The argument that prison reform is politically unachievable can be supported by several pieces of evidence, which are listed below: 1. Politicians' dependency on the criminal justice system: Many politicians rely on the criminal justice system to ensure public safety and order, making it difficult for them to advocate for significant reform. Additionally, they may fear being perceived as soft on crime, leading to a hesitancy to push for significant changes in the prison system. 2. The influence of private prison corporations: The rise of privatized prisons in the United States has meant that there are now powerful financial incentives for certain private companies to maintain high incarceration rates. Lobbying from these corporations can significantly influence prison policy and hinder meaningful reform efforts. 3. Tough-on-crime political narratives: The decades-long \\"war on drugs\\" and \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric often drive politicians to promote policies focused on punitive measures rather than rehabilitation or alternatives to incarceration. This narrative persists in part because voters continue to express concern about crime rates, and politicians are hesitant to challenge public opinion. 4. Inadequate funding for reform: Implementing meaningful prison reform requires significant investment in education, job training, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment programs. However, many state and federal budgets do not prioritize these types of programs, making it difficult to enact meaningful change within the prison system. 5. Fragmented criminal justice system: The criminal justice system in the United States is highly fragmented, consisting of numerous state, federal, and local agencies. This fragmentation can impede efforts to enact comprehensive prison reform, as changes may need to be implemented at multiple levels of government to truly have a significant impact. 6. Racial disparity and injustice: The criminal justice system disproportionately impacts marginalized communities and perpetuates racial inequality. For many politicians, addressing this disparity may be seen as a controversial move, limiting the likelihood that they will pursue comprehensive reform. 7. A lack of political will: Many politicians may not be genuinely interested in prison reform and may simply pay lip service to the issue. As a result, those who do want to enact changes may struggle to find allies to support and pass the necessary legislation. 8. The impact of economic and political inequality: Marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system are less likely to have a strong voice in the political process. Consequently, their concerns may not be given the attention and priority needed for reform efforts to succeed. In conclusion, while there have been some localized successes in prison reform, such as the First Step Act in the United States, the evidence indicates that achieving comprehensive and lasting reform on a larger political scale remains a considerable challenge. The factors mentioned above illustrate the significant barriers in place that may prevent significant progress in prison reform, and they demonstrate that the fight remains an uphill battle for reform advocates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

The Menominee (also spelled Menomini, derived from the Ojibwe language word for \\"Wild Rice People;\\" known as Mamaceqtaw, \\"the people,\\" in the Menominee language) are a federally recognized nation of Native Americans, with a 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2) reservation in Wisconsin. Their historic territory originally included an estimated 10 million acres (40,000 km2) in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members. The tribe was terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time which stressed assimilation. The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975.  The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854 in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned 432 square miles (1,120 km2) on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community.  After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county's area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county's area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. The reservation includes a plot of off-reservation trust land of 10.22 acres (41,400 m2) in Winnebago County, Wisconsin to the south, west of the city of Oshkosh. The reservation's total land area is 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2), while Menominee County's land area is 357.960 sq mi (927.11 km2).  The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, holding 1,337 (29.3%) of the county's 4,562 total population, as opposed to the reservation's 3,225 (70.7%) population, as of the 2000 census.  The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue. They speak English as well as their traditional Menominee language, one of the Algonquian languages. Current population of the tribe is about 8,700.

Question: Aairplane is used for moving people across bodies of water, and airplanes are responsible for air, noise, and water pollution. Given these facts, what pollutes the environment among the following options: - bacteria  - airplanes  - deforestation  - moon  - sun  - cells  - Smoking  - flooding Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the factors that contribute significantly to the pollution of the environment are airplanes, deforestation, and smoking. Each of these factors impacts the environment in different ways, as discussed below. 1. Airplanes:  Airplanes play a crucial role in global transportation, enabling people and goods to move quickly across countries and continents. However, they also contribute significantly to air, noise, and water pollution. The emissions from aircraft engines release gases and particles into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, and particulate matter. These emissions contribute to climate change, as CO2 is a major greenhouse gas, and NOx can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, which has detrimental effects on human health. Additionally, the noise pollution resulting from airplanes can cause stress and sleep disturbance for communities located near airports. The noise generated by commercial jet engines can exceed 100 decibels, which can be extremely disruptive to humans and wildlife. Finally, water pollution can occur when deicing chemicals or other pollutants from aircraft maintenance are discharged into nearby waterways. These pollutants can harm aquatic life and pose risks to human health. 2. Deforestation: Deforestation refers to the clearing of forested areas, often to make way for agriculture, logging, mining, or infrastructure development. This process has significant environmental impacts, as forests are essential for maintaining Earth's biodiversity, regulating the climate, providing essential ecosystem services, and supporting human livelihoods. When forests are destroyed, carbon stored in the trees and the forest soil is released into the atmosphere as CO2, contributing to climate change. In addition, deforestation can lead to the loss of habitat for countless plant and animal species, resulting in reduced biodiversity and even species extinction. Moreover, deforestation can negatively affect the water cycle by reducing evapotranspiration (the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere), contributing to changes in rainfall patterns and an increased risk of flooding or drought. Soil erosion and degradation can also result from deforestation, as the removal of vegetation exposes soil to wind and water erosion, leading to decreased fertility and a loss of essential nutrients. 3. Smoking: Cigarette smoking causes pollution in various ways, including through air pollution, litter, and the production of toxic waste. The burning of tobacco and other additives in cigarettes produces thousands of chemicals, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, benzene, and particulate matter. These chemicals can have negative impacts on both human health and the environment. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes also contributes to air pollution and can adversely affect the health of non-smokers exposed to it. In indoor environments, such as homes, offices, or public spaces, second-hand smoke can compromise air quality and increase health risks for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. Furthermore, cigarette litter, such as discarded filters and packaging, contributes to the pollution of outdoor spaces and aquatic environments, as these items can take years to break down and can release toxic chemicals into the environment. In summary, while not all the factors listed contribute to environmental pollution, airplanes, deforestation, and smoking do have significant negative effects on the environment. As a result, it is crucial to work on reducing the pollution caused by these factors through implementing sustainable practices, innovative technologies, and raising awareness about their environmental impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Q: What happens to structural genes in the presence of tryptophan?   A: A:","output":"In the presence of tryptophan, structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis are usually repressed. The process occurs step-by-step: 1. Tryptophan is present in the environment: When the cell has a sufficient amount of tryptophan available, it does not need to produce more through the expression of structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis. 2. Tryptophan acts as a corepressor: Tryptophan binds to the trp repressor protein, a regulatory protein that controls the expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. 3. Formation of the repressor-corepressor complex: When tryptophan binds to the trp repressor, it induces a conformational change in the protein, enabling it to bind to the operator site present on the DNA. 4. Binding to the operator: The repressor-corepressor complex attaches to the operator site, which is found in the trp operon – a cluster of genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. The operator is a specific DNA sequence located between the promoter and the structural genes. 5. Inhibition of gene transcription: By binding to the operator, the repressor-corepressor complex prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes in the trp operon. This process is called negative control or repression. 6. Reduced expression of structural genes: As transcription is inhibited, the expression of the structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis is reduced, stopping the production of tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. In conclusion, the presence of tryptophan in the environment leads to the repression of structural genes involved in its synthesis, allowing the cell to conserve energy by not producing unnecessary amounts of tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. Question: What is most likely her job? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The person's job is most likely a barista or server at a chain cafe in England.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.

Bomb Is ‘Possibility’ in Loss of Russian Jet Over Egypt, Obama Says In a joint news conference on Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain spoke about working together to ensure the safety of both countries’ citizens. WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday evening that there was “a possibility” that a terrorist bomb was responsible for the destruction of a Russian passenger plane that broke apart last Saturday over the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Mr. Obama said in a radio interview that there may have been a bomb on the plane, but he did not go as far as his counterparts in Britain, who have suggested that the destruction of the plane, and the death of all on board, was most likely the result of a terrorist explosion. “I don’t think we know yet,” Mr. Obama told the Seattle radio station KIRO during an interview broadcast Thursday afternoon. “Whenever you’ve got a plane crash, first of all you’ve got the tragedy, you’ve got making sure there’s an investigation on site. I think there is a possibility that there was a bomb on board. And we are taking that very seriously.” “We are going to spend a lot of time making sure our own investigators and our own intelligence community figures out exactly what’s going on before we make any definitive pronouncements,” Mr. Obama added. “But it is certainly possible that there was a bomb on board.” A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane. At the White House earlier in the day, administration officials said that the United States had not yet made a determination about the cause of the crash, which occurred after takeoff from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el Sheikh. But they added that the government had not excluded the possibility of a bomb. “We can’t rule anything out, including the possibility of terrorism,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters in Washington. In London on Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that “more likely than not a terrorist bomb” had brought down the plane as he announced plans to bring British citizens back from Sharm el Sheikh. Mr. Obama’s comments were the first direct indication by the president that the downing of the Russian airliner might have been something other than a technical malfunction. American officials have repeatedly cautioned that the cause of the crash is still under investigation. Officials have noted that no American airlines fly to or from the airport in Egypt where the Russian plane began its flight. And they said before the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration had already issued guidance to airlines to fly higher above the region. Mr. Obama’s comments came during a series of short interviews with five radio stations across the country in which the president urged people to sign up at HealthCare.gov for health insurance during the current open enrollment period. During one of the interviews, Mr. Obama was asked about the Russian plane. In recent days, administration officials have noted the differences between the crash of the Russian plane and other airline disasters. In this case, unlike the case last year of the missing Malaysian jetliner, the United States does not have F.B.I. agents working directly on the crash. “Right now there are not,” Mr. Earnest said Wednesday afternoon. “Right now this is an Egyptian investigation. The Russians are involved in it.” Officials have said American investigators were “in touch” with their counterparts in other countries who are looking into the crash. But without an American known to be on the flight — a presence that often gives officials a reason to participate in the investigation of a crash — there has been no reason for direct United States involvement, they said. The Russians and the Egyptians have also not asked for help from the United States in the investigation, officials said. Mr. Cameron made his remarks about the crash in an appearance at No. 10 Downing Street with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. “My role is to act in the right way to keep British citizens safe and secure,” Mr. Cameron said. He did not cite what specific intelligence he had suggesting that the explosion that destroyed the Russian plane about a half-hour after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh was deliberate. Mr. Sisi, who has counseled against jumping to premature conclusions, did not criticize Mr. Cameron’s decision to temporarily suspend flights between Britain and Sharm el Sheikh, but Egyptian officials in Cairo did just that. Hossam Kamal, the Egyptian minister of civil aviation, said that the suggestion of a bomb was not based on facts — and that there was as yet no evidence for that theory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the British government had made the decision to halt flights unilaterally. In a telephone conversation on Thursday with Mr. Cameron, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also took exception to his comments, saying that any “assessment of the causes of the crash should be based on the data” from the investigation, the Kremlin said in a statement. While there has been much speculation about what brought down the jet, the cause largely remains a mystery. American military officials said this week that satellite surveillance had detected a flash of light as the plane was ripped apart, suggesting that it had been blown up by a bomb, an explosion caused by a mechanical failure or the ignition of fuel. Mr. Sisi, standing next to Mr. Cameron, acknowledged that Britain had previously raised safety concerns. “Ten months ago, we were asked by our British friends to send teams to Sharm el Sheikh airport to make sure that all our security procedures there were good enough, and to provide adequate safety and security for our passengers,” he said, adding that the Egyptian authorities were ready to address any outstanding concerns. The prime minister’s office announced later Thursday that British and Egyptian officials had “agreed on a package of additional security measures that is being put in place rapidly,” and that flights to Britain from Sharm el Sheikh would resume Friday. Two British airlines, Monarch and EasyJet, said they were ready to run flights to bring stranded tourists back to Britain from the Red Sea resort, where there are an estimated 20,000 British citizens. Flights to Sharm el Sheikh from Britain remained suspended. Two subsidiaries of the German airline Lufthansa, the Düsseldorf-based Eurowings and Edelweiss Air, which operates out of Zurich, suspended their Sharm el Sheikh flights on Thursday. Lufthansa said the group was working out a plan to help passengers return home. Aleksandr Neradko, head of the Federal Air Transport Agency in Russia, said investigators in Egypt looking into the crash would be examining the wreckage of the airplane, including the hand baggage and victims’ bodies to see if there were traces of explosive substances. Also on Thursday, the first two funerals were held for victims of the crash. The funeral for Nina Lushchenko, 60, who ran a school canteen, was a traditional Orthodox service at a 16th-century church in Veliky Novgorod, about 125 miles south of St. Petersburg. The funeral for another victim, Aleksei Alekseev, 31, took place in St. Petersburg. An earlier version of this article misstated something United States officials noted about the airport at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh. No American airlines land or depart, not no airlines at all. Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Dan Bilefsky from London. Reporting was contributed by Stephen Castle from London, Nicola Clark from Paris, Kareem Fahim from Cairo, and Ivan Nechepurenko and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

In a radio interview, Obama stated that there may have been a bomb on the plane, but did not go as far as British officials, who suggested that the crash was likely the result of a terrorist explosion. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but the possibility of a bomb on board is being taken very seriously by the United States. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 224 people on board, and has led to increased security measures and a temporary suspension of flights between Britain and the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el Sheikh."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\".  - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west. Residents of Sydney are known as \\"Sydneysiders\\". Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney.  - Neville Kenneth Wran, (11 October 1926  20 April 2014) was the Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986.

The result was a second \`\` Wranslide '' : a landslide victory for the Australian Labor Party under Neville Wran , in which the government increased its already sizeable majority . The Liberals suffered the double indignity of losing the seat contested by their leader Bruce McDonald to an independent , and of being reduced to the same number of seats in parliament as their ostensible junior coalition partner , the National Country Party . In fact it was the second election in a row in which the sitting Liberal leader had failed to win a seat ; Peter Coleman had been rolled in his own seat in 1978 . Both the Liberals and National Country Party finished with 14 seats . The election marked another milestone for electoral reform in New South Wales . The allocation of preferences became optional , and gerrymandering was eliminated . Two further reforms were proposed -- and passed -- in referendums put to voters on the same day . Ted Mack , mayor of North Sydney Council , won the seat of North Shore from Opposition Leader McDonald . John Hatton was re-elected unopposed in the seat of South Coast . Changes to the process for setting electoral district boundaries took effect at this election : eliminating both partisan gerrymandering and the routine creation of smaller rural seats to boost the share of country representatives in parliament .

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full name of the people that Jo Elizabeth Stafford performed duets with?  Jo Elizabeth Stafford (November 12, 1917 – July 16, 2008) was an American traditional pop music singer and occasional actress, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an opera singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song \\"You Belong to Me\\" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, the record becoming the first by a female artist to reach number one on the U.K. Singles Chart. Born in Coalinga, California, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. While still at high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra. In addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop standards for Capitol Records and Columbia Records. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston. She also performed duets with Gordon MacRae and Frankie Laine. Her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) giving concerts for soldiers during World War II earned her the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio series The Chesterfield Supper Club and later appeared in television specials—including two series called The Jo Stafford Show, in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the U.K. A:","output":"The full names of the people that Jo Elizabeth Stafford performed duets with are: 1.

(CNN) -- The explosive found hidden in a package on a plane in the United Arab Emirates on Friday may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday.  The explosive, along with a similar device found in the United Kingdom, appear to have been designed to detonate on their own, without someone having to set them off, the top White House counterterrorism official told CNN.  \\"It is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them,\\" said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.  U.S. investigators believe al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to that package and another one found on a second airplane in Britain's East Midlands Airport on Friday, a federal official, who was briefed by authorities, told CNN Sunday. Both packages were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois.  Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who was high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's failed Christmas Day underwear bomb.  Separately, an engineering student arrested in Yemen was released Sunday, along with her mother, according to her father, Mohammed Al-Samawi. She was earlier identified as Hanan Al-Samawi, a fifth-year student at Sanaa University in the Yemeni capital, said Abdul-Rahman Barman, a human rights attorney and activist who said he was asked to represent her.

Given the question: Title: UPS did not deliver this gift Review: THis was purchased as a gift for my daughter and UPS returned it to sender, I am not happy! Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review can be identified as negative. The sentiment expressed by the reviewer is primarily based on dissatisfaction with the delivery experience of their purchase, which was intended to be a gift for their daughter but could not reach the intended recipient. This dissatisfaction is explicitly mentioned in their statement, \\"I am not happy!\\" which indicates that the reviewer's experience was unpleasant and not up to their expectations. It is important to note that the negative sentiment is directed towards the delivery service provided by UPS, rather than the product itself or the seller of the product. The reviewer does not mention any issues or concerns with the quality, usability, or value of the product – their primary concern is the failure of UPS to deliver the item to their daughter. Hence, the negativity in this review is mainly related to the logistics aspect of the transaction, rather than the product or the seller. Nevertheless, online sellers and service providers must take responsibility for their choice of delivery partners, as negative experiences associated with delivery services can greatly impact the overall satisfaction of customers. In this instance, the customer's unpleasant experience with UPS reflects poorly on the seller and may subsequently influence the purchaser's decision to make future transactions with them. This is especially true if the customer is required to select a different delivery service, which may involve additional costs, time, and effort, just to ensure the satisfactory delivery of their purchase. In conclusion, the review in question can be considered negative as it reflects the disappointment and dissatisfaction experienced by the customer regarding the delivery service provided by UPS. Despite the fact that the negativity is not directed towards the product or the seller, the situation still highlights the importance for sellers and service providers to be aware of the potential impact that negative delivery experiences can have on overall customer satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The name sounds funny but the idea is no joke: it's a personal toilet called the pee-pool, Anders Wilhelmson, a Swedish architect, is the inventor of the pee-pool. He became interested in the idea of sanitation  after taking part in a research project on the social and political development of cities, One of the most common problems he found in developing countries was the lack of toilets, He wanted to do something to help, So working with others, he started the project in 2005, and the next year started a company called Peepoolple. The toilet is a single--use bag made of environmentally friendly plastics, The inside is treated with urea  , a chemical commonly used as fertilizer, The hotter the weather, the more quickly the waste turns into what is needed by plants The sanitation process can be as soon as a couple of hours or as long as two to four weeks ,You can just bury it in a pot and grow whatever you like. The company expects to start selling the bags in August in Kenya and Bangladesh, But it is just beginning production and sales in Nairobi now, Full production could reach about half a million bags a day and people may be able to buy the pee-pool in countries Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc. The United Nations says more than two and a half billion people around the world do not have good sanitation .Many have no choice but to use the outdoors, which is not only bad for the environment ,but also harmful to people's health, Each year, poor sanitation leads to three fifths of those people getting an infectious disease which on average causes one out of 1,000 patients to die.
