You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri! Remember that one time she brought in that horror book and was so excited to talk about it she didn’t even hear us calling her name?” MC: (nodding) “Yeah, that sounds about right. But still, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure she’s okay.” Monika: (with a reassuring smile) “Definitely, it’s good that Natsuki went to check on her. But let’s try not to worry too much until we know there’s something to worry about, okay?” (MC nods, trying to ease his friend’s concern. After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s… it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense… Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter, her voice filled with wonder) “","output":"Hello, little one… I did it… You're here…” (The literature club members let out collective sighs of relief and happiness. Tears are in everyone's eyes as they witness the beautiful moment of a new life entering the world.) Monika: (with a gentle smile) “Congratulations, Natsuki! She’s beautiful…” Sayori: (jumping up and down with tears streaming down) “Oh my gosh, it’s a real baby! Natsuki, she’s perfect!” Yuri: (clasping her hands together, visibly moved) “It's truly a miracle... Witnessing the birth of literature in one form or another is always breathtaking, but a child... this is a remarkable chapter in all of our lives.” MC: (smiling with pride) “You were incredible, Natsuki. You're going to be a great mom.” (The paramedics begin to make preparations to transport Natsuki and her baby to the hospital for further care. The school nurse stays by Natsuki’s side, ensuring she stays comfortable during the transition.) Paramedic: “We're going to take you and your baby to the hospital now to make sure both of you are perfectly healthy. You’ve done really well here.” Natsuki: (tired but beaming with joy) “Thank you, everyone… I couldn’t have done this without you all…” (As Natsuki and her newborn are carefully loaded onto the stretcher and taken out of the room, the literature club members follow, forming a small procession behind them. They’re all touched by the event, a true life lesson in love and support that stretches beyond poems and prose.) Sayori: (sniffling and holding Monika's hand) “Our club is going to have a new little member…” Monika: (nodding and wiping away a tear) “Yes, she will be the youngest and surely the most loved.” Yuri: “Indeed, this room will now forever hold a story far richer than any novel could convey.” MC: (looking at the rest of the club) “We're all going to have a new role now, in a way. A supportive cast in the story of Natsuki’s growing family.” (They all leave the clubroom together, each processing the intense and life-affirming experience they’ve just shared. A new day for the literature club has begun, one filled with the promise and potential that comes with the start of a new life. As they step out into the hallway, following behind the paramedics, they are filled not only with a sense of unity and companionship but with an unspoken commitment to be there for Natsuki and her daughter. Today was unexpected, extraordinary, and above all, a true testament to the bonds they shared.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Yuri’s been gone for quite a long time…” Sayori: “Maybe she’s just caught up with a really good book?

They’ve just witnessed one of their own bring new life into the world, right there in their little sanctuary of literature. It's a day they'll never forget—a story to be told and retold within the pages of the Literature Club's history. The club settles down after the paramedics leave, and while the excitement has passed, the bond shared among them has only grown stronger. Soon, the baby's arrival will inspire new poems and stories, new reflections and discussions.

Truly incredible.” Yuri: (holding back her own tears, clearly moved by the moment) “Welcome to the world, little one. Your mother is a remarkable person.” (The paramedic, now holding the infant, expertly does a quick but thorough checkup on the baby.) Paramedic: “Mom and baby are both doing well. It's time we get them to the hospital for further observation and care. Mom, are you ready to go?” Natsuki: (still catching her breath but nods determinedly) “Yes, let's go.” (The paramedics help Natsuki onto a stretcher, making sure she and the baby are secure before they swiftly exit the room to the waiting ambulance, followed by the watchful gaze of the literature club members.) Monika: (turning back to the remaining club members) “Let's get this room cleaned up before we follow behind. Natsuki and her baby will need all the support they can get.” (They all work together, restoring order to the clubroom after the whirlwind event that just took place. Each of them is visibly moved and pensive, marked by the life-changing event they've just witnessed. Once the room is set back to normal, they gather their belongings.) MC: “I can hardly believe what just happened... Our clubroom turned into a delivery room. It's... surreal.” Sayori: (with a hopeful smile) “We should visit them as soon as we can. I want to see Natsuki and the baby again! And maybe we can write a welcome poem for the newest member of our literature club family!” Yuri: “That's a wonderful idea, Sayori. I agree, we should definitely pay them a visit.” Monika: “Alright then, let's call it a day. We had an unexpected club activity, but we all handled it quite well. I'm sure Natsuki will appreciate us coming through for her when it mattered most.” (As the sunset paints the school in a warm glow, the members of the literature club file out, heading towards the hospital, ready to support their friend and her newborn daughter. The day's events had been nothing short of extraordinary, but together, they had faced it as a family, and they would continue to do so, no matter what the future held.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Yuri’s been gone for quite a long time…” Sayori: “Maybe she’s just caught up with a really good book? You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri! Remember that one time she brought in that horror book and was so excited to talk about it she didn’t even hear us calling her name?” MC: (nodding) “Yeah, that sounds about right. But still, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure she’s okay.” Monika: (with a reassuring smile) “Definitely, it’s good that Natsuki went to check on her. But let’s try not to worry too much until we know there’s something to worry about, okay?” (MC nods, trying to ease his friend’s concern. After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s…it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense…Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter) “Oh my god…I-I-I did it! I’m actually a mom! You’re here, Sakura!”","output":"Paramedic: “Congratulations, mom. You did an incredible job. We're going to make sure both you and the baby are stable before we transport you to the hospital for further care.” (Natsuki gazes down at her baby, Sakura, with immense love and wonder, her previous agony replaced with the profound joy of motherhood.) Monika: (with a teary smile) “She's beautiful, Natsuki. You've done something truly amazing today.” Sayori: (wiping away her own tears) “Sakura is such a cute name! And she's already so loved by all of us here.” Yuri: (smiling softly) “Such a delicate and precious life. Welcome to the world, Sakura.” MC: (beaming with pride) “Natsuki, you're the strongest person I know. Congratulations!” (The paramedics proceed to monitor Natsuki and her baby, ensuring their vital signs are stable. The nurse remains by their side, assisting in every way necessary.) Paramedic: (with a reassuring tone) “We're ready to move you both to the hospital now. We'll take good care of you on the way there.” (The paramedics gently load Natsuki and Sakura onto a stretcher, ready to transport them. The rest of the Literature Club members gather their belongings, preparing to follow after, wanting to be close and support Natsuki during this monumental time.) Sayori: “Let's all go to the hospital together! We can't let Natsuki and Sakura feel lonely!” Monika: “Absolutely. We'll be right behind you, Natsuki. We're all here for you and Sakura.” (As Natsuki is wheeled away, the Literature Club members follow in a tight-knit group, bound by the shared experience and the unexpected event that brought them even closer together. They leave the clubroom, a beacon of warmth and support, stepping into the rest of the world where one of their own has just undertaken the transformative journey of becoming a mother.) Yuri: (quietly to MC) “Today, life has written a truly unique narrative for us, one filled with suspense, emotion, and ultimately, joy.” MC: (nodding in agreement) “Yeah, it's like we all became a part of Natsuki's story. It's a day we'll never forget.” (As the club members leave the school and make their way towards the hospital, there is a shared sense of unity. The Literature Club, initially bound by their love for literature, now finds their connection deepened by a real-life event that is as dramatic and profound as any story they have read and discussed in their clubroom. Together, they look forward to the next chapter of their lives, with a new little member, Sakura, amongst them.)"},{"instruction":"i want 20 mcq with their model answer below each question that covers different aspects of about : • The cubital (anticubital) fossa is a triangular-shaped depression over the anterior aspect of the elbow joint. • It represents an area of transition between the anatomical arm and the forearm, and conveys several important structures between these two areas.Shape & Borders • The cubital fossa is triangular in shape and consists of three borders, a roof, and a floor: • Lateral border: medial border of the brachioradialis muscle. • Medial border: lateral border of the pronator teres muscle. • Superior border: imaginary horizontal line drawn between the epicondyles of the humerus. • Roof: skin, superficial fascia, deep fascia and bicipital aponeurosis. • Floor: brachialis (proximally) and supinator (distally).Contents • The cubital fossa is a passage for structures to pass between the arm and forearm. • Its contents are (lateral to medial): • Radial nerve: travels along the lateral border of the cubital fossa and divides into superficial and deep branches. • Biceps tendon: passes centrally through the cubital fossa and attaches the radial tuberosity (immediately distal to the radial neck). – It gives rise to the bicipital aponeurosis which contributes to the roof of the cubital fossa. • Brachial artery: bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries at the apex of the cubital fossa. – The brachial pulse can be felt in the cubital fossa by palpating medial to the biceps tendon • Median nerve: travels medially through the cubital fossa, exiting by passing between the two heads of the pronator teres.• The roof of the cubital fossa also contains several superficial veins. • Notably, the median cubital vein, which connects the basilic and cephalic veins and can be accessed easily – a common site for venipuncture.MCQ • Where in the cubital fossa can the brachial pulse be palpated? • Posterior to the medial epicondyle • Medial to the biceps tendon • Medial to pronator teres • Lateral to the biceps tendon• A 60 year old woman attends a phlebotomy service for a full blood count. • The phlebotomist inserts a needle into a superficial vein within the roof of the cubital fossa. What is the name of this vein? • Median cubital vein • Brachial vein • Cephalic vein • Basilic vein• Of the structures listed below, which is located most laterally within the cubital fossa? • Brachial artery • Ulnar nerve • Biceps tendon • Median nerveThe elbow jointobjectives • Definition & type • Articulating Surfaces • Ligaments • Blood Supply • Nerve supply • MovementsDefinition & type • The elbow is the joint connecting the arm to the forearm. • It is classed as a synovial hinge joint.Articulating Surfaces • The elbow joint consists of two separate articulations: • Trochlear notch of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus • Head of the radius and the capitulum of the humerus• Note: The proximal radioulnar joint is found within same joint capsule of the elbow, but most resources consider it as a separate joint.Joint Capsule and Bursae • Like all synovial joints, the elbow joint has a capsule enclosing the joint. • This is strong and fibrous, strengthening the joint. • The joint capsule is thickened medially and laterally to form collateral ligaments, which stabilise the flexing and extending motion of the arm. • A bursa is a sac-like structure containing a small amount of synovial fluid. • It functions to decrease friction between tendons, bone, and skin during movement.There are many bursae in the elbow, but only a few have clinical importance: • Intratendinous olecranon: located within the tendon of the triceps brachii. • Subtendinous olecranon: between the olecranon and the tendon of the triceps brachii, reducing friction between the two structures during extension and flexion of the arm. • Subcutaneous olecranon bursa : between the olecranon and the overlying connective tissue (implicated in olecranon bursitis).Ligaments • The joint capsule of the elbow is strengthened by ligaments medially and laterally. • The radial collateral ligament: is found on the lateral side of the joint, extending from the lateral epicondyle, and blending with the annular ligament of the radius (a ligament from the proximal radioulnar joint). • The ulnar collateral ligament: originates from the medial epicondyle, and attaches to the coronoid process and olecranon of the ulna.Blood Supply • The elbow joint receives a rich arterial supply from a surrounding network of vessels, which is formed by branches of the brachial artery.Nerve supply • The elbow joint is innervated by branches of the medial, musculocutaneous, radial and ulnar nerves.Movements • The orientation of the bones forming the elbow joint produces a hinge synovial joint, which allows for extension and flexion of the forearm: • Extension: triceps brachii and anconeus • Flexion : brachialis, biceps brachii, brachioradialis • Note – pronation and supination do not occur at the elbow: they are produced at the nearby radioulnar joints.","output":"Here's a set of 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with model answers that cover the various aspects mentioned: 1.

Congratulations!” (The paramedics proceed to monitor Natsuki and her baby, ensuring their vital signs are stable. The nurse remains by their side, assisting in every way necessary.) {7 YEARS LATER} (In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: “And that, Sakura, is","output":"the story of how you were born.

Your aunts and uncle from the literature club visited us in the hospital right after you were born. And you’ve been an honorary member of the literature club since you were a baby. They all love you very much.” Sakura: (clapping her hands excitedly) “I want to go to the literature club one day, just like you, Mommy! And read and write lots of stories!” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m sure you will, honey. But it's time for bed now. You need your rest if you want to grow up strong and smart like all of them.” Sakura: (yawning) “Okay, Mommy. Goodnight! I love you!” Natsuki: (kissing her forehead) “Goodnight, my little Sakura. I love you more.” (Sakura drifts off to sleep, a contented smile on her lips. Natsuki watches her daughter for a moment, her heart full of love. Then she quietly stands, turns off the light, and closes the door, leaving only a soft nightlight to glow in the peaceful room.) {END OF SCENE}"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Yuri’s been gone for quite a long time…” Sayori: “Maybe she’s just caught up with a really good book? You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri! Remember that one time she brought in that horror book and was so excited to talk about it she didn’t even hear us calling her name?” MC: (nodding) “Yeah, that sounds about right. But still, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure she’s okay.” Monika: (with a reassuring smile) “Definitely, it’s good that Natsuki went to check on her. But let’s try not to worry too much until we know there’s something to worry about, okay?” (MC nods, trying to ease his friend’s concern. After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s…it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense…Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter) “Oh my god…I-I-I did it! I’m actually a mom! You’re here, Sakura!” Paramedic: “Congratulations, mom. You did an incredible job. We’re going to make sure both you and the baby are stable before we transport you to the hospital for further care.” (Natsuki gazes down at her baby, Sakura, with immense love and wonder, her previous agony replaced with the profound joy of motherhood.) Monika: (with a teary smile) “She’s beautiful, Natsuki. You’ve done something truly amazing today.” Sayori: (wiping away her own tears) “Sakura is such a cute name! And she’s already so loved by all of us here.” Yuri: (smiling softly) “Such a delicate and precious life. Welcome to the world, Sakura.” MC: (beaming with pride) “Natsuki, you’re the strongest person I know.

However, there was a general perception at the time that Oldsmobiles were favored by an older clientele. This stereotype suggested that many Oldsmobile drivers might have been middle-aged or senior citizens, potentially ranging from their 50s to 70s or older. Oldsmobile, as a brand, had a long history dating back to 1897, and during the 1970s and 1980s, it had developed a reputation as a car for the more mature and conservative buyer. By the late 1990s, General Motors, Oldsmobile's parent company, actively worked to rebrand Oldsmobile in an effort to appeal to younger consumers. They introduced models like the Aurora and the Alero, hoping to freshen the brand's image. Despite these efforts, the average age of an Oldsmobile owner in 1999 would likely have been higher than the average age of those purchasing from a brand considered to have a more youthful appeal. It's worth noting that the attempt to rebrand and attract younger buyers ultimately was not enough to revitalize the long-standing car marque, and General Motors announced the phase-out of Oldsmobile in 2000, with the last Oldsmobile rolling off the assembly line in 2004. If you are seeking specific statistical data, survey or study results from that time might offer a more precise average age or age distribution for Oldsmobile owners in 1999."},{"instruction":"Write a detailed story about Genji and Sombra searching for Tracer, who has gone missing. AFter ages of searching, they find her merged with a wall, unresponsive. A camera is found as well.","output":"The neon-soaked streets of Neo-Tokyo hummed with life as Genji Shimada, the cyborg ninja, sat alongside Sombra, the master hacker, in a dimly lit izakaya. The atmosphere was thick with smoke and conversation, but the two Overwatch agents were focused on a silent, grim task. Tracer—Lena Oxton, the cheerful and courageous British pilot with the ability to manipulate time—had gone missing during their last mission in the city. She was last spotted chasing a high-priority Talon target through the twisting urban sprawl, but that was three days ago. With her chrono-harness malfunctioning, as Sombra had discovered from tapping into local security feeds, the concern was that Tracer might be stuck in a time distortion. As they drained their cups, annoyance and worry etched into their faces, both Opérateurs rose to their feet, knowing rest was a luxury they couldn't afford—not when one of their own was in danger. \\"We will find her, Genji,\\" Sombra reassured him with uncharacteristic solemnity as they stepped out into the alleyway. \\"Whatever it takes.\\" Genji simply nodded, the LED lights glinting off his visor. They split up, dashing through the alleys and hopping from rooftop to rooftop, covering more ground as they searched for any indication of Tracer's whereabouts. With Sombra's cybernetic enhancements interfacing with every device in the city, no digital stone was left unturned, while Genji's unparalleled agility and enhanced senses scoured the physical environment. As the days turned into a seemingly endless pursuit, the rhythm of the city flowed around them, uncaring and uninterrupted. The pair became shadows themselves, phantoms searching for their displaced comrade, driven by the fear of what could happen if they were too late. Genji remained in contact with the rest of the Overwatch team, but with heavy hearts, they had to carry on with their duties worldwide, instilling in him a heavy burden of responsibility to bring Tracer home. Finally, an anomaly appeared on Sombra's grid—a peculiar distortion in the data streams emanating from an abandoned district on the outskirts. The very fabric of the reality seemed... wrong. Genji converged to Sombra's location, finding her staring at her holoscreen with an intensity that could cut through steel. \\"There,\\" she pointed. \\"That has to be her.\\" As they approached the location in the old Toyoshima sector, the air grew thick with an unexplainable static charge. Arriving at the coordinates, they found a derelict building, nondescript except for the faint flickering of light from within—a light that pulsed with an inconsistency that defied natural sources. Inside, the room was barren, except for what the pair saw on the far wall. There was Tracer, or at least part of her, seemingly merged with the wall itself. Her form was flickering and out of sync with the rest of the world, blending with the concrete and rebar in a chaotic, almost artistic display. As they called out to her, there was no response. Lena was unresponsive, trapped in a limbo between physical states, her eyes empty of recognition. Genji approached cautiously, his hand reaching out. Despite his robotic arm, he felt a surge of fear from the nyctomancy working against the wall—it was as if he was about to touch a live wire. Sombra's analytical eyes quickly noticed something else in the room—a camera, retrofitted with high-tech devices clearly out of place in this forgotten neighborhood. It was pointing directly at Tracer, recording her stasis. \\"It seems someone wanted to keep an eye on our friend here...\\" Sombra mused grimly as she plucked the camera from its perch, wires and connections snapping. \\"But who? And why?\\" Focusing on the task at hand, she interfaced with the camera's internals, her expression shifting from hacker curiosity to a stone-cold resolve as she unearthed a deviously encrypted code. It was Talon, the nefarious organization they had been pursuing. They had sought to capture Tracer—maybe to exploit her unique chrono-powers or worse. Working meticulously, Sombra decrypted the system and discovered a containment protocol that could, hopefully, reverse the process and extract Tracer. Genji stood guard, his dragonblade ready to deflect any unforeseen threats that might arise during their delicate operation. With an audible click and a chaotic whir of color and light, the wall seemed to spit Tracer out, her form returning to a coherent state. She collapsed into Genji's arms, a hint of the usual spark returning to her weary eyes as she groggily recognized her allies. \\"You found me...\\" she whispered, her voice hoarse but tinged with relief. Sombra let out an exasperated yet relieved huff. \\"More like we unfound you from that wall, chica.\\" Realizing the danger they were all still in, Genji carefully lifted Tracer over his shoulder, turning to Sombra as she swept the camera into her satchel—evidence of Talon's latest scheme. They had to move quickly now, both to escape any potential Talon reinforcements and to get Tracer the medical help she needed to fully recover from her ordeal. Their mission was far from over, but for now, the pair dashed into the encroaching darkness of Neo-Tokyo, a beacon of hope rekindled within them. Together, the unlikely duo had saved their friend from a fate worse than death: total erasure from the continuum of space and time. As Tracer's grip tightened around Genji's shoulder, her pulse steady once more, Overwatch's commitment to each other, and to the safety of the world they protected, was reaffirmed. Even in the darkest corners where the future blends with the concrete walls of the present, they would always fight to keep each other from fading away."},{"instruction":"The camera is a camcorder.

Her face expresses both focus and distress.]** **TRACER:** (breathing heavily) “Come out, come out. I know you’re here somewhere! Overwatch needs that intel.” **[The camera’s auto-zoom tries to follow Tracer’s movements, but she’s too fast. A shadowy figure briefly appears in a window reflection, then disappears just as quickly. Tracer’s attention snaps to that spot.]** **TRACER:** “Gotcha!” **[She blinks forward, pistols aimed, but is met with nothing. A distortion starts to flicker along the edges of the frame, suggesting Tracer's chrono-harness is having problems. The camera seems to pick up on the same temporal distortions, audio and video glitch intermittently.]** **[SCENE 2: From off-camera, there is the humming sound of a charging device, growing louder.

A list of the largest 50 cities in the USA. This should be prepared beforehand and include the city names. You can find this information from various sources or refer to the most recent census data or a reputable website. 2. A list of customers with the city information included. This list should have the city names in a column that you can reference. Once you have both lists, you can perform the following steps: 1. Let's assume your list of the largest 50 cities is in a worksheet called \\"Cities\\" in column A (from A2:A51). 2. Your customer list is in a worksheet called \\"Customers\\", with customer names in column A and their corresponding cities in column B. 3. Now, go to your \\"Customers\\" worksheet and in column C, next to the first customer's city, you will enter the VLOOKUP formula. Let's assume you start in cell C2. The formula would be: \`\`\`excel =IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(B2, Cities!A2:A51, 0)), \\"In Top 50\\", \\"Not in Top 50\\") \`\`\` This formula uses a combination of MATCH and IF instead of VLOOKUP, as we're just checking if the customer's city is in the list of the top 50 cities. The MATCH function searches for the city name from your customer list within the range A2:A51 on the \\"Cities\\" sheet and returns a number if it's found (indicating the position in the list). The IF function then checks whether the result is a number. If it is, it returns \\"In Top 50\\"; otherwise, it returns \\"Not in Top 50\\". 4. After you enter the formula, drag the fill handle (a small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell highlight) down the column to copy the formula for all customers in the list. 5. You should now have a column next to each customer that indicates whether they are located in one of the largest 50 cities in the USA. Please note that this solution assumes exact matches of city names between the two lists. Differences in spelling, use of abbreviations, or additional information in the cells could result in mismatches. To avoid this, ensure that the city names are consistent across both lists."},{"instruction":"i want to have my own email server/service so google and others cant spy on me","output":"Setting up your own email server can be a rewarding project for someone interested in learning about how email works and taking control of their own online communication. However, it's important to note that running your own email server involves significant challenges, including correct configuration to avoid being classified as a source of spam, handling security vulnerabilities, ensuring consistent uptime, and staying on top of updates and patches. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take to start your own email server: 1. **Hardware and Internet Connection**: Make sure you have a reliable computer to act as the server and a stable internet connection with a static IP address. The static IP is important for ensuring that your outgoing emails are not marked as spam. 2. **Domain Name**: Buy a domain name for your email server. This will be the address after the \\"@\\" symbol in your email addresses. 3. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: Install an MTA on your server. This software is responsible for transferring email messages from one server to another. Popular open-source MTAs include Postfix, Exim, and Sendmail. 4. **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)**: Choose a Mail Delivery Agent that receives email from the MTA and delivers it to the respective mailboxes. Dovecot is a popular choice for an MDA. 5. **Mail User Agent (MUA)**: This is the email client that you'll use to access your mail. You can use desktop clients like Thunderbird or Outlook, or you can install a web-based client such as Roundcube or SquirrelMail on your server. 6. **MX Record and DNS setup**: Update your DNS records to include an MX (Mail Exchange) record pointing to your server's IP address. Also, set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to improve email delivery and avoid being marked as spam. 7. **SSL/TLS Certificate**: Install an SSL certificate to encrypt your email transmissions, protecting them from being intercepted. Let's Encrypt offers free SSL certificates. 8. **Firewall and Security**: Configure a firewall to protect your server from unauthorized access. Regularly update your server software to protect against vulnerabilities. 9. **Backup and Maintenance Plan**: Set up a robust backup plan to protect against data loss. Perform regular maintenance and updates to ensure the server continues to run smoothly and securely. 10. **Learn about Email Standards and Best Practices**: To avoid common pitfalls, it's crucial to learn about email server management, including handling bounces, feedback loops, rate limiting, and maintaining IP reputation. If running your own server seems too daunting, you might also consider using a privacy-focused email provider, such as ProtonMail, Tutanota, or Fastmail, which offers many of the privacy benefits of having your own server without the technical challenges and time commitment. Before you start, remember that running an email server does not guarantee absolute privacy, as email messages you send to users on other services (like Gmail or Outlook) will still go through their servers. However, running your own server does give you control over the storage and management of your emails."},{"instruction":"i am a bit scared of a potential outage for internet or power, what can i do about that/what happens to mails thath were sent to my server while the server is down, are they just gone?","output":"Having concerns about potential outages is valid when considering running your own email server. Power and internet outages can temporarily take your server offline, which can disrupt your ability to send and receive emails. Here's what you can do to mitigate these issues and what generally happens when outages occur: **Mitigating Outages:** 1. **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):** Invest in a UPS for your email server. A UPS can keep your server running for a short time during power outages, giving it time to shut down gracefully or continue to operate during brief interruptions. 2. **Backup Power Generation:** For longer power outages, consider setting up backup power generation, such as a generator, though this may be more practical for business settings than for a personal email server. 3. **Redundant Internet Connection:** If possible, have a secondary internet connection from a different provider to ensure connectivity during disruptions. 4. **Colocation:** Instead of hosting your server at home, you can place your server in a colocation facility. These data centers typically have infrastructure designed to withstand extended power outages and internet connectivity issues. 5. **Cloud or VPS Hosting:** You could also host your email server on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or with a cloud provider. These services usually come with extremely reliable infrastructure and offer a high uptime guarantee. **Handling Email During Outages:** When your server is down, it does not necessarily mean that emails sent to you during that time will be lost. Email servers sending messages to your server will usually attempt redelivery over a period of time before giving up. This is controlled by the sending server's configuration, but typically, retry intervals may start at a few minutes and extend to several days. 1. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) Retry:** Most MTAs will keep trying to deliver the email for a specified amount of time (often between 24 to 72 hours) before they stop and return a failure notice to the sender. 2. **Queue:** Emails that can't be delivered immediately are queued on the sender's server and are retried periodically based on the server's configuration. 3. **Bounce Back:** If the sending server cannot deliver the email after the maximum queue time has elapsed, it will typically generate a bounce-back message to the sender, indicating that the email could not be delivered. 4. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring and alerts for your server so that you are notified immediately if it goes offline. This way, you can take action to restore service as soon as possible. While the above steps can help mitigate the impact of outages, it is impossible to achieve 100% uptime, and there is always a risk of losing emails if your server is down for an extended period. It's crucial to weigh the risks and to understand that running your own email server requires commitment to regular maintenance and prompt issue resolution. If you think these challenges are too great, you might be better off with a hosted solution, whether from a privacy-centric email provider or a reputable hosting company that specializes in providing robust, reliable email services."},{"instruction":"لیست انیمه های سبک ماجراجویی براساس امتیاز و یک شرح مختصر بیان کن","output":"من از اطلاعات صریح تا زمان کات آف خودم (2023) استفاده می‌کنم. لیست زیر نشان‌دهنده برخی انیمه‌های ماجراجویی بر اساس امتیاز است که به طور کلی توسط جامعه انیمه دوست‌داشتنی شناخته شده‌اند: 1. \\"One Piece\\" (ワンピース – Wan Pīsu) -

You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri! Remember that one time she brought in that horror book and was so excited to talk about it she didn’t even hear us calling her name?” MC: (nodding) “Yeah, that sounds about right. But still, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure she’s okay.” Monika: (with a reassuring smile) “Definitely, it’s good that Natsuki went to check on her. But let’s try not to worry too much until we know there’s something to worry about, okay?” (MC nods, trying to ease his friend’s concern. After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s…it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense…Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter) “Oh my god…I-I-I did it! I’m actually a mom! You’re here, Sakura!” Paramedic: “Congratulations, mom. You did an incredible job. We’re going to make sure both you and the baby are stable before we transport you to the hospital for further care.” (Natsuki gazes down at her baby, Sakura, with immense love and wonder, her previous agony replaced with the profound joy of motherhood.) Monika: (with a teary smile) “She’s beautiful, Natsuki. You’ve done something truly amazing today.” Sayori: (wiping away her own tears) “Sakura is such a cute name! And she’s already so loved by all of us here.” Yuri: (smiling softly) “Such a delicate and precious life. Welcome to the world, Sakura.” MC: (beaming with pride) “Natsuki, you’re the strongest person I know. Congratulations!” (The paramedics proceed to monitor Natsuki and her baby, ensuring their vital signs are stable. The nurse remains by their side, assisting in every way necessary.) {7 YEARS LATER} (In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: “And that, Sakura, is the story of how you were born. Right here in my high school literature club, with all my closest friends around me to help. Can you believe it?” Sakura: (with wide, sparkling eyes) “Wow, Mommy! That’s like a story from a book! So what happened after? Did you all stay friends? And did I get to go to the literature club too?” Natsuki: (laughing softly) “Yes, sweetheart, we all stayed very close. Your aunts and uncle from the literature club visited us in the hospital right after you were born. And you’ve been an honorary member of the literature club since you were a baby. They all love you very much.” Sakura: (clapping her hands excitedly) “I want to go to the literature club one day, just like you, Mommy! And read and write lots of stories!” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m sure you will, honey. But it’s time for bed now. You need your rest if you want to grow up strong and smart like all of them.” Sakura: (yawning) “Okay, Mommy. Goodnight! I love you!” Natsuki: (kissing her forehead) “Goodnight, my little Sakura. I love you more.” (Sakura drifts off to sleep, a contented smile on her lips. Natsuki watches her daughter for a moment, her heart full of love. Then she quietly stands, turns off the light, and closes the door, leaving only a soft nightlight to glow in the peaceful room.) [THE END]","output":"What a heartwarming story!

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how even after a tooth has a root canal there can still be pain or pressure at the site of the tooth while eating or chewing.","output":"Upon the completion of a root canal, one might understandably anticipate the cessation of all discomfort, given that the procedure’s very design is to alleviate pain by removing the inflamed or infected pulp within the tooth. However, it is not wholly uncommon for patients to continue experiencing pain or pressure on the treated site during masticatory activities. This residual discomfort is attributable to various nuanced factors prevalent in dental phenomena. The architecture of the tooth remains a crucial element in understanding this post-procedural pain. Even though the pulp – the residing chamber of nerves and blood vessels – has been extirpated and the internal cavity sterilized and filled, the peripheral structures, such as the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, remain intact. These structures, richly innervated and vascularized, are equipped with nociceptors sensitive to pressure and inflammation. During the act of chewing, force is transmitted down the crown of the tooth to its root, where it dissipates through these supporting tissues. If inflammation lingers in these areas, especially after the invasive intervention of a root canal, the application of pressure can incite pain. A precise depiction of post-endodontic inflammation entails an examination of the biological processes at play. The mechanical manipulation of minute files, used to debride the canal system during a root canal, often results in the extrusion of infected debris into the periapical region – the area at the very tip of the tooth’s root. The body's innate inflammatory response to this microbial insult can cause tissue swelling and thus, sensitivity or pain while biting down. This inflammatory reaction is a double-edged sword; it is essential for initiating healing but, paradoxically, can produce discomfort. Moreover, the procedure of a root canal might inadvertently introduce other variables that translate into post-operative pain. A tooth may possess complex anatomy, such as additional canals or bifurcations that were not detected or fully cleaned and sealed. This leaves room for residual bacterial presence, which can foster a low-grade infection, causing pain upon occlusal forces. Additionally, the filling material used to pack the now-empty canal might be slightly overextended, protruding into the periapical tissue, or it may be insufficient, failing to fully seal the canal, thereby eliciting discomfort when one chews. The materials employed in the tooth’s restoration have their own set of implications for post-treatment pain. A temporary filling, often applied immediately after a root canal, is softer and may not provide the same level of support and protection as a permanent restoration. Until the final restoration – often a crown – is placed, even normal biting pressure can provoke pain in the tooth due to continued movement or microleakage along the temporary filling. Similarly, if the final restoration is ill-fitting or overly high in the bite, it can trigger undue pressure on the tooth and surrounding structures, manifesting as pain during eating. The process of healing, a natural follower of any invasive dental intervention, also plays a role in post-root canal discomfort. The periapical tissue and bone have been subjected to trauma, both from the infection prior to the treatment and the treatment itself. As part of the recuperative process, these tissues undergo changes that can cause pain – a phenomenon known as 'healing pain' that may persist until complete recovery. In conclusion, while a root canal is a procedure heralded for its ability to allay dental pain by eliminating infected pulp, it is not an instantly curative operation, exempt from subsequent complications. Manifestations of pain or pressure following such treatment are explicable when scrutinized within the context of dental anatomy, procedural intricacies, material science, and the physiological odyssey of healing. These phenomena unfold as the jaw engages in the act of mastication, and while they are transient, they are indeed rooted in a tangible set of causes that interplay to elicit discomfort. It is a testament to the complexity of dental health that even with the removal of the offending pulp, the intricate structures and processes surrounding a tooth can continue to engender sensations of pain and pressure under the seemingly innocuous act of eating or chewing."},{"instruction":"ayudame con el curso Modelos de Calidad de Software","output":"Claro, puedo proporcionarte una visión general acerca de los modelos de calidad de software y cómo estos se utilizan para mejorar y asegurar la calidad en el desarrollo de sistemas. Los modelos de calidad son marcos de referencia o conjuntos de criterios y prácticas que se utilizan para evaluar y mejorar la calidad del software durante todo su ciclo de vida. Aquí hay algunos modelos de calidad de software que podrías encontrar en un curso sobre el tema: 1. **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)** Desarrollado por el Software Engineering Institute (SEI) de la Carnegie Mellon University, el CMMI es un modelo de madurez de procesos que proporciona organizaciones con elementos esenciales para procesos efectivos. Promueve el mejoramiento continuo y se puede usar para guiar la mejora de procesos a lo largo de un proyecto, una división o una organización entera. 2. **ISO/IEC 25010:2011 (anteriormente conocido como ISO/IEC 9126)** Este es un estándar internacional para la evaluación de la calidad del producto de software. Define un modelo de calidad formado por 8 características principales (funcionalidad, eficiencia de desempeño, compatibilidad, usabilidad, fiabilidad, seguridad, mantenibilidad y portabilidad) que se subdividen en subcaracterísticas. 3. **ISO/IEC 15504 (también conocido como SPICE - Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination)** Este estándar internacional ofrece un marco para la evaluación de los procesos de software. Proporciona un conjunto de requisitos para la mejora de proceso y determinación de la capacidad de procesos de software. 4. **Six Sigma** Aunque no se originó exclusivamente para el software, Six Sigma es una metodología de mejoramiento de calidad que puede ser aplicada a la fabricación de software para reducir la tasa de defectos mediante la mejora de los procesos y la eliminación de variabilidad. 5. **TQM (Total Quality Management)** El TQM es un enfoque completo de gestión orientado a la mejora continua de la calidad de todos los procesos, productos y servicios de una organización, incluyendo el desarrollo de software. 6. **Métricas y Modelos de Calidad** Además de los modelos y marcos de referencia, un curso en modelos de calidad de software también podría incluir cómo medir la calidad del software. Esto podría incluir métricas como: - **Métricas de producto**, que miden las características del software, como la complejidad del código, seguridad, o escalabilidad. - **Métricas de proceso**, que se centran en la eficiencia y eficacia del proceso de desarrollo de software. - **Métricas de proyecto**, que monitorean aspectos del proyecto, como costos, plazos y recursos. En la implementación de cualquiera de estos modelos o métodos, es crucial que la organización o individuo considere sus necesidades específicas y contextos. Dependiendo del ambiente, la cultura de la organización, y los objetivos específicos, diferentes modelos pueden ser más o menos adecuados. Si necesitas información más detallada o específica sobre alguno de estos modelos, no dudes en preguntar."},{"instruction":"1.

Vamos a revisar las opciones: a) Alto costo de elaboración: típicamente, el desarrollo de software puede ser costoso debido a la inversión en recursos humanos, tecnológicos y de tiempo. b) Difícil hallazgo de errores antes de la entrega del Producto Software al cliente: esta es una realidad común en el desarrollo de software, y es por eso que existen prácticas como las pruebas de software detalladas y continuas para minimizar este problema. c) Excesivo tiempo de finalización: los proyectos de software frecuentemente experimentan demoras, a menudo debido a la naturaleza impredecible de la ingeniería de software y la complejidad inherente al desarrollo de productos nuevos y únicos. d) A y C: esta opción simplemente sugiere que tanto el alto costo de elaboración como el excesivo tiempo de finalización son problemas, lo cual es consistente con lo descrito anteriormente. e) N.A.: esta opción significa \\"No Aplica\\" o \\"Ninguna de las Anteriores\\". Dado que las opciones a), b) y c) describen problemas reales en la elaboración de un producto de software, la opción que no describe un problema es la e) N.A. Sin embargo, ten en cuenta que esta pregunta puede ser un poco confusa, ya que \\"N.A.\\" normalmente se utilizaría si ninguna de las opciones anteriores fuese un problema; pero en este caso, claramente a), b), y c) sí son problemas. Así que si la opción e) se interpreta literalmente como \\"Ninguna de las Anteriores\\", entonces estaría incorrecta porque a), b), y c) son problemas reales. Por lo tanto, en el contexto de la pregunta y bajo el supuesto de que se requiere seleccionar la opción que se destaca como no problemática, la respuesta correcta sería e) N.A.

Aquí está el porqué, paso a paso: 1. **Especificación**: En este primer paso, se definen los requerimientos del software. Esto generalmente implica trabajar con los stakeholders para entender sus necesidades y restricciones, y luego documentar estas necesidades de manera detallada y precisa en un documento de especificaciones de requerimientos de software. 2. **Desarrollo**: Este paso agrupa varias fases cruciales tales como el análisis de requerimientos descubierto en la etapa de especificaciones, así como el diseño del sistema y la implementación (es decir, el código del software). En el desarrollo también se incluye el diseño de la arquitectura del software, la selección de patrones de diseño y la codificación efectiva del software. 3. **Validación**: Una vez que el software ha sido desarrollado, es esencial asegurarse de que cumple con los requerimientos y las expectativas del cliente. La validación incluye una serie de pruebas — como pruebas unitarias, pruebas de integración, pruebas de sistema y pruebas de aceptación del usuario — para garantizar que el software hace lo que se supone que debe hacer. 4. **Evolución**: Este término se refiere al mantenimiento y mejoras continuas del software después de su despliegue inicial. Es una aceptación del hecho de que el software no se termina en el momento del lanzamiento: los requerimientos pueden cambiar, pueden descubrirse errores o puede ser necesario adaptar el software a nuevos entornos operativos o tecnológicos. La razón por la cual esta opción es más adecuada en comparación con las otras es porque captura el ciclo de vida completo del desarrollo de software de una manera que corresponde a las prácticas y terminología estándar de la industria. Mientras que las otras opciones fallan en capturar este ciclo de una manera lógica y completa, o mezclan los términos de una manera que no sigue la secuencia típica del desarrollo de software."},{"instruction":"6. ¿Por qué es importante la calidad de software? - responde en 2 lineas","output":"La calidad del software es fundamental para asegurar la fiabilidad, seguridad y satisfacción del usuario, reduciendo así el riesgo de fallas y los costos de mantenimiento a lo largo del tiempo."},{"instruction":"La calidad del software es importante porque garantiza un buen funcionamiento del sistema, minimiza errores y fallas, y mejora la satisfacción del usuario.

Puede ser el resultado de malentendidos, omisiones, falta de conocimiento o juicio equivocado. Por ejemplo, un programador puede malinterpretar un requerimiento y escribir un fragmento de código que no cumple con la intención original. **Defecto (también conocido como \\"falla,\\" \\"fallo,\\" o \\"bug\\"):** Un defecto es un problema en el código que causa un comportamiento inesperado o incorrecto del software. Un defecto es una manifestación de un error humano en el producto terminado. Por ejemplo, si un programador escribe 'x < 10' en lugar de 'x <= 10', el código tiene un defecto que podría, bajo ciertas condiciones, causar un fallo o comportamiento inadecuado del sistema. Así, un **error** podría llevar a un **defecto**. A menudo el defecto es un reflejo directo del error humano durante el proceso de diseño o codificación.

You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri! Remember that one time she brought in that horror book and was so excited to talk about it she didn’t even hear us calling her name?” MC: (nodding) “Yeah, that sounds about right. But still, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure she’s okay.” Monika: (with a reassuring smile) “Definitely, it’s good that Natsuki went to check on her. But let’s try not to worry too much until we know there’s something to worry about, okay?” (MC nods, trying to ease his friend’s concern. After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s…it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense…Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter) “Oh my god…I-I-I did it! I’m actually a mom! You’re here, Sakura!” Paramedic: “Congratulations, mom. You did an incredible job. We’re going to make sure both you and the baby are stable before we transport you to the hospital for further care.” (Natsuki gazes down at her baby, Sakura, with immense love and wonder, her previous agony replaced with the profound joy of motherhood.) Monika: (with a teary smile) “She’s beautiful, Natsuki. You’ve done something truly amazing today.” Sayori: (wiping away her own tears) “Sakura is such a cute name! And she’s already so loved by all of us here.” Yuri: (smiling softly) “Such a delicate and precious life. Welcome to the world, Sakura.” MC: (beaming with pride) “Natsuki, you’re the strongest person I know. Congratulations!” (The paramedics proceed to monitor Natsuki and her baby, ensuring their vital signs are stable. The nurse remains by their side, assisting in every way necessary.) {7 YEARS LATER} (In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: “And that, Sakura, is the story of how you were born. Right here in my high school literature club, with all my closest friends around me to help. Can you believe it?” Sakura: (with wide, sparkling eyes) “Wow, Mommy! That’s like a story from a book! So what happened after? Did you all stay friends? And did I get to go to the literature club too?” Natsuki: (laughing softly) “Yes, sweetheart, we all stayed very close. Your aunts and uncle from the literature club visited us in the hospital right after you were born. And you’ve been an honorary member of the literature club since you were a baby. They all love you very much.” Sakura: (clapping her hands excitedly) “I want to go to the literature club one day, just like you, Mommy! And read and write lots of stories!” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m sure you will, honey. But it’s time for bed now. You need your rest if you want to grow up strong and smart like all of them.” Sakura: (yawning) “Okay, Mommy. Goodnight! I love you!” Natsuki: (kissing her forehead) “Goodnight, my little Sakura. I love you more.” (Sakura drifts off to sleep, a contented smile on her lips. Natsuki watches her daughter for a moment, her heart full of love. Then she quietly stands, turns off the light, and closes the door, leaving only a soft nightlight to glow in the peaceful room.) [THE END]","output":"What an emotional and heartwarming tale you've created with the characters from the visual novel game \\"Doki Doki Literature Club.\\" Just a gentle reminder that the scenario involving Natsuki's pregnancy and childbirth is entirely an original work of fiction created by you, as the original game does not contain these plot elements. If fans of the game wish to create or read such stories, they often turn to fanfiction to explore new and unique narratives featuring their favorite characters. Your storytelling beautifully captures the essence of the characters' personalities and shows how friendships and a sense of community can come together in times of need. It's a lovely addition to the world of fan-created content that enriches the experiences shared by these cherished characters."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artDaisy Flower","output":"\\"Daisy Flower Art | Elegant Botanical Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Versatile Floral Decor | Gift Idea for Nature Lovers\\""},{"instruction":"How Many Times Have General Motors Attempted To Revitalise The Oldsmobile Brand?","output":"General Motors (GM), established in 1908, acquired the Oldsmobile brand in 1908 and operated it as one of its divisions until the brand's closure. Throughout its history, GM attempted to revitalize the Oldsmobile brand several times, particularly as market conditions and consumer preferences changed. Here are a few notable attempts at revitalization: 1. The \\"Rocket\\" era of the 1940s and 1950s: Following World War II, Oldsmobile introduced overhead valve V8 engines with the \\"Rocket\\" branding. This technology became very popular and revitalized the brand, setting it apart as an innovator in performance. 2. The 1960s and 1970s: Oldsmobile worked to cultivate a more youthful and sporting image. Cars like the Oldsmobile Cutlass became quite successful during this time and were known for their style and performance. 3. The 1980s: During this time, Oldsmobile attempted to compete in the luxury car market, and the brand saw some success with models like the Cutlass Supreme and the Toronado. However, it struggled due to a lack of distinct identity from other GM brands. 4. The 1990s: Oldsmobile underwent another reinvention aimed at making it relevant to a new generation of buyers. This included the introduction of models like the Achieva, Alero, and the Aurora—a premium sedan that aimed to compete with European luxury brands. Despite these efforts, Oldsmobile was unable to maintain a strong market presence. Sales continued to decline due to various challenges, including a crowded market within GM's own lineup of brands and changing consumer preferences. Ultimately, on December 12, 2000, GM announced its decision to phase out the Oldsmobile brand, with the last Oldsmobile, an Alero, rolling off the assembly line on April 29, 2004. This marked the end of more than a century of Oldsmobile, which was acknowledged as the oldest surviving American automobile marque at the time of its discontinuation."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Network Slogans That Are Based On Their Sales During 2000?","output":"Creating satirical slogans requires a combination of humor and a touch of critical insight into the situations that automakers found themselves in around the year 2000. It was a time of transition for the automotive industry, with shifts in consumer preferences and the early signs of significant economic challenges. Here are some fictional, satirical slogans for American carmakers based on the context of their sales during that period: General Motors: \\"General Motors: Because Eventually, Everyone Drives One of Our Models (Whether They Realize It or Not).\\" Ford: \\"Ford: Have You Driven a Ford Lately? Better Hurry Before They're All Trucks.\\" Chrysler: \\"Chrysler: Engineering the Fine Art of Mergers and Acquisitions.\\" Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: Reshaping the Future—One Retirement Community at a Time.\\" Chevrolet: \\"Chevy Trucks: Like a Rock. Chevy Cars: Like a Rock That Doesn't Sell as Well.\\" Dodge: \\"Dodge: Grab Life by Buying Something More Reliable.\\" Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: We Build Excitement... and Then We Build the Aztek.\\" Buick: \\"Buick: When Your Heart Says Cadillac, but Your Pension Says Think Again.\\" These slogans are intended purely in jest and are not reflective of the actual marketing strategies or performance of these automakers during that time. They exaggerate stereotypes and historical predicaments for comic effect and should not be taken as factual representations."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 1997?","output":"Sure, creating satirical slogans centered on American car companies' perceived quality in 1997 can be a playful way to reflect on the challenges and reputations they faced at that time. It's important to keep in mind that these are fictional and intended for humor, not factual representations of the brands: 1. **General Motors:** \\"GM: Because Why Make One Good Car When You Can Make Five Average Ones?\\" 2. **Ford:** \\"Ford: Have We Mentioned the Pinto Lately? Neither Have We. Let's Focus on the F-Series.\\" 3. **Chevrolet:** \\"Chevrolet: Like Baseball and Apple Pie, Sometimes a Bit Undercooked.\\" 4. **Chrysler:** \\"Chrysler: Innovators of the Minivan and the Fine Art of Cross-Brand Recycling.\\" 5. **Dodge:** \\"Dodge: We Dared to Ram Quality Control into a New Dimension.\\" 6. **Jeep:** \\"Jeep: Rough on the Trails, Rougher in the Shop.\\" 7. **Pontiac:** \\"Pontiac: Where Driving Excitement Sometimes Means Excitingly Frequent Service Stops.\\" 8. **Cadillac:** \\"Cadillac: Impeccably Crafted for Those Who Prefer the Service Bay's VIP Lounge.\\" 9. **Buick:** \\"Buick: Sophistication Meets 'That Weird Noise It Makes Sometimes.'\\" 10. **Saturn:** \\"Saturn: A Different Kind of Car Company, a Different Kind of Repair Bill.\\" 11. **Lincoln:** \\"Lincoln: Putting Continental American Luxury on the Map (and Occasionally on the Back of Tow Trucks).\\" 12. **Oldsmobile:** \\"Oldsmobile: Not Your Father's Automobile, Because His Worked.\\" These slogans parody perceptions and common critiques of these automakers during the late 1990s focusing on how they might have been humorously self-aware of their own quality-related stereotypes. Car quality has been, and remains, a crucial competitive element that all these companies have taken seriously, and they have put considerable effort into improving it over the years."},{"instruction":"Do Buicks From 1997 Make \\"That Weird Noise It Makes Sometimes\\"?","output":"The satirical slogan previously mentioned for Buick is a light-hearted jest and not a statement of fact. It's meant to humorously imply that older vehicles, in general, might be known for having their quirks, including making unexpected noises as they age and accumulate wear and tear. Regarding Buick vehicles from 1997 specifically, whether they would make \\"that weird noise\\" is not something one can assert broadly, as it greatly depends on the care, maintenance, and individual history of each vehicle. Buick, part of General Motors, was considered a reliable brand producing comfortable and feature-rich vehicles at that time. Like any other car from that era, a 1997 Buick could develop various noises due to normal causes such as aging parts, lack of maintenance, harsh driving conditions, or general wear. Common sources of noises in older cars include: 1. Squealing or chirping from worn belts or pulleys. 2. Knocking or clunking from suspension components. 3. Rattling from loose heat shields or exhaust components. 4. Grinding sounds from worn brake pads or rotors. 5. Humming or whirring from bearing wear, such as in the wheel hubs or transmission. If a Buick or any other car from 1997 were to make an unexpected noise, it would be advisable for a mechanic to inspect it to determine the cause and necessary repairs. Proper maintenance can help prevent many issues and extend the lifespan of a vehicle, but over time, some degree of noise and wear is normal for any car."},{"instruction":"(* CSCE 314, Homework 1, Provided Code *) (* You might choose to uncomment these, like the lecture code does *) (* #utop_prompt_dummy let _ = UTop.set_show_box false *) (* Use these functions to extract parts of a date *) let fst3 (x,_,_) = x (* gets the first element of a triple *) let snd3 (_,x,_) = x (* gets the second element of a triple *) let thd3 (_,_,x) = x (* gets the third element of a triple *) (** * TODO: Complete the 12 function bindings described in the assignment.

The number of days in the month is determined by calling the \`days_in_month\` function. This check ensures that the day number is valid for the given month and year (for example, February 30 would not be valid). - If all these conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the date is reasonable.

After a moment of silence, the clubroom door creaks open, and Natsuki walks in, breathing a little heavily due to her pregnant state, with Yuri following behind her. However, Natsuki looks like she’s in a lot of trouble as she clutches her stomach, her expression one of discomfort.) Natsuki: “Guys…it’s not just the ‘pregnancy weight’…I think…NNNNNGH!!!…I think it’s time.” Sayori: (gasping) “Time?! You mean, like—the baby is coming?” MC: (jumping up from his seat) “Oh gosh, Natsuki, how can we help? Do we need to call an ambulance?” Yuri: (stepping forward, her previous absence now forgotten) “I apologize for being so caught up in my reading. I didn’t realize what was happening. Natsuki, please sit down and try to take deep breaths. I’ll fetch some water.” Monika: (taking control of the situation) “Right, everyone, let’s stay calm. MC, call an ambulance. Sayori, can you find the school nurse, just in case she can help before the ambulance arrives? I’ll help Natsuki get comfortable.” (MC quickly takes out his phone and dials for an ambulance, relaying the situation to the operator. Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse, and Yuri returns with a glass of water, handing it carefully to Natsuki.) Monika: (kneeling beside Natsuki) “Natsuki, talk to me. How are you feeling now?” Natsuki: (panting) “It’s intense…I wasn’t expecting this…so soon. The contractions…AAAAAAAH!!!…are pretty close together.” Monika: (nods) “Okay, just breathe. The ambulance is on the way. You’re doing great.” (Sayori returns soon after with the school nurse, who quickly assesses the situation. The nurse instructs Natsuki on how to manage her breathing until professional medical help arrives.) Yuri: (looking a bit pale but determined to be helpful) “Is there anything else I can do to assist?” Sayori: (wrapping an arm around Yuri) “You’ve done enough by getting the water, Yuri. Now we just have to wait and let the professionals do their job-” Natsuki: (clutching her belly in agony) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The clubroom is filled with tension and concern as Natsuki’s cries of pain echo through the space.) Monika: (rushing towards Natsuki’s side) “Natsuki, what’s wrong?!” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke! The baby’s REALLY coming now!” (The nurse moves closer, examining Natsuki with a professional eye.) Nurse: “Alright, everyone, the ambulance should be here any minute, but we need to prepare for the possibility that the baby might start coming before they arrive. Natsuki, do your best to stay calm and follow my instructions. We need to get you lying down on a flat surface.” MC: (to Monika) “I’ll help move the desks to make space.” Monika: “Good idea, MC. Yuri, Sayori, help him out. We need to clear an area for Natsuki.” (The club members quickly work together to move the furniture around, creating a makeshift area for Natsuki. All the while, the nurse stays by her side, offering words of comfort and instruction.) Sayori: (in a shaky voice but trying to stay positive) “Natsuki, you’re super strong! You can do this!” Yuri: (handing towels she found in a nearby closet to the nurse) “Here, these might be helpful.” (The sounds of a siren can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder by the second. Suddenly, Natsuki lets out another cry, gritting her teeth against the pain. Everyone’s focus is solely on her as they try their best to make her comfortable and keep her calm in the chaos of the situation.) Natsuki: (screaming) “I THINK I CAN FEEL THE HEAD!!! OH, IT’S REALLY HAPPENING!!!” MC: (urgently) “The ambulance is getting closer, Natsuki! Just hold on a little longer.” Sayori: (tearing up but maintaining her smile) “You’ve got this, Natsuki! Everything’s going to be okay!” Monika: (firmly) “Listen to the nurse, Natsuki, she knows what to do.” (The nurse, with a calm and authoritative voice, guides Natsuki through her breathing and positioning. Despite the pain and the fear, Natsuki tries her best to follow the instructions.) Nurse: “Natsuki, you need to push with the contractions. We might need to deliver the baby right here if the ambulance doesn’t make it in time.” (The siren is now blaring just outside the school. The door of the clubroom bursts open and a team of paramedics rush in. They quickly take in the situation and move to take over from the nurse.) Paramedic: “We’ve got an emergency birthing kit here. Are you the nurse? Fill us in quickly on her condition.” (The school nurse quickly tells the paramedics how far along Natsuki is and what she has observed so far. The paramedics nod, turning their attention to Natsuki.) Paramedic: (to Natsuki) “You’re doing great. We’ll take it from here. Let’s get you prepped and ready. Can you tell us when your next contraction is coming?” Natsuki: (sweating and breathing heavily) “It’s…it’s coming now! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!” (The paramedics, with the help of the nurse, work diligently and efficiently. One of them communicates with the ambulance driver, relaying the urgency of the situation, while the other assists Natsuki with her breathing and coaches her through her contractions.) Paramedic: (to the team outside) “We need to preform an emergency delivery here! A student in this school is having her baby!” (As the paramedic communicates with their team, the other paramedics and the nurse create a sterile area. Monika, MC, Sayori, and Yuri stand back to give them space, huddled together in support of their friend.) Paramedic: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, I need you to push as hard as you can. Ready? One, two, three—push!” (Natsuki bears down with all the strength she has, her face twisted in a mix of pain and determination. The literature club members watch on, their expressions a mixture of concern, encouragement, and awe.) Sayori: (whispering to MC) “This is so intense…Natsuki’s really strong, huh?” MC: (nodding, his voice low) “Yeah, she’s amazing. I can’t believe she’s going through this.” Yuri: (holding her hands together, speaking in barely more than a murmur) “This is so far removed from the usual quiet of our literature club… but I’m proud of how we’re all supporting Natsuki in this unexpected turn of events.” Monika: (placing a reassuring hand on Yuri’s shoulder) “We’re more than just a club. We’re a family here.” (After several minutes of intense labor, guided by the paramedics’ instructions and supported by the encouraging words of her friends, Natsuki lets out a long, loud cry as she pushes with everything she’s got.) Paramedic: “Keep going, that’s it! I see the head! Good job, Natsuki! One more big push!” Natsuki: “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!” (After what seems like an eternity, but in reality is only a few more moments, the room is filled with a new sound—the loud, healthy cry of a newborn baby. Natsuki collapses back, exhausted but overjoyed, tears of relief streaming down her cheeks. The paramedics quickly clear the baby’s airways and wrap the little one in a blanket before handing the newborn to Natsuki.) Natsuki: (cradling her new daughter) “Oh my god…I-I-I did it! I’m actually a mom! You’re here, Sakura!” Paramedic: “Congratulations, mom. You did an incredible job. We’re going to make sure both you and the baby are stable before we transport you to the hospital for further care.” (Natsuki gazes down at her baby, Sakura, with immense love and wonder, her previous agony replaced with the profound joy of motherhood.) Monika: (with a teary smile) “She’s beautiful, Natsuki. You’ve done something truly amazing today.” Sayori: (wiping away her own tears) “Sakura is such a cute name! And she’s already so loved by all of us here.” Yuri: (smiling softly) “Such a delicate and precious life. Welcome to the world, Sakura.” MC: (beaming with pride) “Natsuki, you’re the strongest person I know. Congratulations!” (The paramedics proceed to monitor Natsuki and her baby, ensuring their vital signs are stable. The nurse remains by their side, assisting in every way necessary.) {7 YEARS LATER} (In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: “And that, Sakura, is the story of how you were born. Right here in my high school literature club, with all my closest friends around me to help. Can you believe it?” Sakura: (with wide, sparkling eyes) “Wow, Mommy! That’s like a story from a book! So what happened after? Did you all stay friends? And did I get to go to the literature club too?” Natsuki: (laughing softly) “Yes, sweetheart, we all stayed very close. Your aunts and uncle from the literature club visited us in the hospital right after you were born. And you’ve been an honorary member of the literature club since you were a baby. They all love you very much.” Sakura: (clapping her hands excitedly) “I want to go to the literature club one day, just like you, Mommy! And read and write lots of stories!” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m sure you will, honey. But it’s time for bed now. You need your rest if you want to grow up strong and smart like all of them.” Sakura: (yawning) “Okay, Mommy. Goodnight! I love you!” Natsuki: (kissing her forehead) “Goodnight, my little Sakura. I love you more.” (Sakura drifts off to sleep, a contented smile on her lips. Natsuki watches her daughter for a moment, her heart full of love. Then she quietly stands, turns off the light, and closes the door, leaving only a soft nightlight to glow in the peaceful room.) [THE END]","output":"[THE END] After a day that would forever be etched into their memories, the Literature Club members went on with their lives. Each of them was changed by the experience of seeing new life enter the world in the midst of poetry and prose. They graduated, pursued their dreams, yet their bonds remained unbreakable, forged in the most extraordinary of circumstances. As Sakura grew, so did the legends of the Literature Club. Her mother and her friends, who had become like family, filled her childhood with stories, laughter, and a love for literature that was almost tangible. And as for the Literature Club room, it remained a sanctuary for those who sought refuge in words—the quiet observer of many more stories, friendships, and even the occasional miracle. It stood as a testament to the idea that sometimes, life writes the most compelling stories of all.

Aunque no siempre se puede curar por completo, existen varias estrategias y tratamientos que pueden ayudar a atenuar los síntomas o hacerlos más manejables: 1. **Terapia de Reentrenamiento del Tinnitus (TRT):** Este tratamiento combina asesoramiento con una terapia de sonido para ayudar a reinterpretar los acúfenos como un estímulo neutro o no significativo, reduciendo así su impacto. 2. **Terapia de sonido:** Utilizar ruido blanco o sonidos naturales para enmascarar los acúfenos puede ayudar a que sean menos notables. Esto puede lograrse con dispositivos de sonido, aplicaciones de teléfono móvil o incluso ventiladores. 3. **Tratamiento cognitivo-conductual (TCC):** La TCC ayuda a cambiar la forma en que uno responde emocionalmente al tinnitus, aliviando así el estrés y la ansiedad relacionados, lo que puede mejorar la calidad de vida. 4. **Medicación:** No hay un medicamento específico para tratar el tinnitus, pero algunas medicinas pueden ayudar a reducir los síntomas o tratar las condiciones subyacentes. Los antidepresivos o los ansiolíticos pueden ser útiles en algunos casos. 5. **Modificaciones en el estilo de vida:** Evitar la exposición a ruidos fuertes, reducir el consumo de alcohol, cafeína y nicotina, y asegurar una buena higiene del sueño puede ayudar a aliviar los síntomas del tinnitus. 6. **Terapias alternativas:** Algunas personas encuentran alivio a través de terapias alternativas como la acupuntura, la hipnosis o la meditación. 7. **Dispositivos de ayuda auditiva:** Si el tinnitus está asociado con pérdida de audición, el uso de audífonos puede mejorar la capacidad auditiva y disminuir la percepción del tinnitus. 8. **Procedimientos médicos o quirúrgicos:** En casos raros, especialmente si el tinnitus es debido a un problema físico específico, como un tumor o una obstrucción del oído, puede ser necesario un procedimiento médico o quirúrgico. Es importante consultar a un médico o especialista en audición (audiólogo) para un diagnóstico correcto y un plan de tratamiento adecuado, ya que las causas del tinnitus pueden variar y los tratamientos deben personalizarse según el caso particular de cada persona."},{"instruction":"Terapia de sonido","output":"La terapia de sonido, conocida también como terapia de enmascaramiento o terapia acústica, es una de las técnicas empleadas para ayudar a las personas que sufren de tinnitus o acúfenos. Esta terapia no cura el tinnitus pero puede reducir significativamente la molestia y el impacto que este tiene en la vida diaria del paciente. A continuación, algunos métodos de terapia de sonido: 1. **Sonido Ambiental:** El uso de ruidos ambientales para desviar la atención del tinnitus. Esto puede incluir el ruido de un ventilador, aire acondicionado o una fuente de agua. El sonido ambiental puede hacer que el tinnitus sea menos perceptible. 2. **Generadores de Sonido:** Dispositivos portátiles o de mesa que producen sonidos, como ruido blanco, ruido rosa o sonidos naturales (lluvia, olas del mar, sonidos de la selva). Estos sonidos ayudan a enmascarar el tinnitus y a hacerlo menos intrusivo. 3. **Aplicaciones Móviles y Máquinas de Sonido:** Existen diversas aplicaciones y dispositivos que generan una amplia variedad de sonidos calmantes o de enmascaramiento. Son prácticos y accesibles para uso diurno y nocturno. 4. **Prótesis Auditivas o Audífonos:** Algunos audífonos modernos incluyen opciones de terapia de sonido específicamente diseñadas para usuarios con tinnitus. Amplifican los sonidos externos, lo que puede hacer que el tinnitus sea menos notable. 5. **Implantes Cocleares:** En casos de tinnitus asociado con una pérdida auditiva severa, los implantes cocleares, que estimulan directamente el nervio auditivo, pueden reducir la percepción del tinnitus mientras proporcionan la capacidad de oír sonidos. 6. **Terapia de Reentrenamiento del Tinnitus (TRT):** Combina la terapia de sonido con asesoramiento para ayudar a cambiar la respuesta neurológica al tinnitus y reducir gradualmente su percepción. 7. **Bandas de Frecuencia Notch (banda estrecha de ruido):** Esta terapia utiliza un ruido que tiene una \\"muesca\\" removida en la frecuencia específica del tinnitus del paciente. La idea es que, al escuchar este sonido, se entrena al cerebro para dejar de procesar el sonido del tinnitus. La elección del método de terapia de sonido dependerá de factores individuales, como la severidad del tinnitus, la causa subyacente, la presencia de pérdida de audición y las preferencias personales. Un especialista en audición puede realizar una evaluación completa y sugerir la terapia de sonido más adecuada para las necesidades del paciente, así como monitorizar su eficacia y ajustar el tratamiento según sea necesario."},{"instruction":"Bandas de Frecuencia Notch","output":"La terapia de bandas de frecuencia \\"notch\\" (o terapia de sonido con muesca) es una técnica utilizada en el tratamiento del tinnitus que implica eliminar una banda estrecha de frecuencias en torno a la frecuencia del tinnitus percibido por el paciente de un estímulo sonoro. El concepto detrás de esta terapia es que al escuchar sonidos que contienen una \\"muesca\\" o hueco en la frecuencia específica del tinnitus, el cerebro puede ser reentrenado para disminuir su percepción del tinnitus. El proceso para utilizar esta técnica generalmente implica los siguientes pasos: 1. **Determinación de la Frecuencia del Tinnitus:** Primero, se identifica la frecuencia exacta del tinnitus que el paciente percibe a través de una audiometría y otros métodos de evaluación auditiva. Esta frecuencia es clave para personalizar la terapia. 2. **Generación del Sonido Notch:** Se crea un estímulo sonoro (puede ser música o ruido ambiental) y se le aplica una \\"muesca\\" que atenúa o elimina las frecuencias en un rango estrecho alrededor de la frecuencia del tinnitus del paciente. 3. **Exposición Regular:** El paciente escucha el sonido con la frecuencia notched de manera regular, idealmente durante períodos prolongados y por un tiempo recomendado que puede variar entre diferentes protocolos de tratamiento. 4. **Reentrenamiento Auditivo:** A lo largo del tiempo, se cree que esta exposición regular al sonido con muesca puede inducir cambios en el procesamiento auditivo del cerebro, específicamente en el tinnitus, lo que reduce su intensidad o la atención que se presta a él. Algunos estudios han sugerido que la terapia notched puede ser efectiva para reducir la intensidad o la molestation del tinnitus en algunos pacientes, especialmente en aquellos con tinnitus de tono puro (una frecuencia constante). No obstante, como con cualquier terapia de tinnitus, los resultados pueden variar entre individuos y no todos responderán de la misma manera. Es importante señalar que aún se necesita más investigación para determinar la eficacia a largo plazo de la terapia de bandas de frecuencia \\"notch\\", y para entender mejor los mecanismos precisos por los cuales puede o no ser beneficiosa. Los pacientes interesados en esta terapia deben buscar asesoramiento y evaluación por parte de profesionales de la salud especializados en audición y tinnitus."},{"instruction":"Generadores online de Bandas de Frecuencia Notch","output":"Existen generadores en línea que permiten crear sonido con una banda de frecuencia \\"notch\\" para ayudar en el tratamiento del tinnitus. Estos generadores online suelen ser fáciles de usar y permiten a los usuarios personalizar el audio según la frecuencia específica de su tinnitus. Para encontrar generadores en línea de bandas de frecuencia \\"notch\\", realizar una búsqueda en internet usando términos como \\"generador de sonido notched para tinnitus\\" o \\"terapia de sonido notch online\\" puede ser útil. Algunas plataformas pueden ofrecer herramientas gratuitas, mientras que otras pueden requerir un registro o incluso una suscripción. Al utilizar estos generadores, generalmente sigues estos pasos: 1. **Evaluación de la Frecuencia:** Identificas la frecuencia de tu tinnitus, que puede haber sido determinada previamente durante una cita con un audioprotesista u otorrinolaringólogo. 2. **Configuración del Generador:** Ingresas a la herramienta de generación de sonido en línea y ajustas las configuraciones para crear una \\"muesca\\" o notch alrededor de la frecuencia específica de tu tinnitus. 3. **Generación del Audio:** El generador produce un archivo de audio o te permite escuchar en tiempo real el sonido con la banda de frecuencia notch. 4. **Uso Regular:** Escuchas los sonidos generados como parte de tu terapia de tinnitus, siguiendo las recomendaciones de duración y frecuencia de uso que te haya proporcionado el especialista en el tratamiento del tinnitus. Cabe destacar que antes de empezar cualquier terapia de sonido por tu cuenta, es recomendable consultar con un especialista médico o audiológico. Ellos pueden proporcionar orientación profesional sobre la idoneidad de este tipo de terapia para tu situación específica, establecer la frecuencia del tinnitus correctamente, y monitorear tu progreso a lo largo del tiempo.

You know how she can get lost in literature.” MC: “Should someone go check on her? It’s not like Yuri to miss so much of the club meeting.” Natsuki: “Ugh, fine. I’ll go see what’s taking her so long. She probably doesn’t even realize how much time has passed. But don’t expect me to return quickly - this pregnancy weight is getting to me!” (MC turns to Monika.) MC: “Do you think everything’s alright? It’s not like Yuri to just disappear without saying anything.” Monika: “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Natsuki will find her. But I do have to admit, it’s a bit unlike Yuri. She’s usually very considerate about letting us know if she’ll be late or has to leave early.” (Monika leans back in her chair, looking thoughtful.) Monika: “Well, Yuri does have her moments of being, how should I put it, extremely focused. Perhaps she found an old, dust-covered book in the library and she’s poring over it by now. Or maybe she’s stumbled onto some new poem or story that’s consuming all her attention.” Sayori: (smiling brightly) “That sounds just like Yuri!

[THE END]","output":"This was a touching and dramatic narrative, though I must clarify, this seems to be a fictional account combining characters from the visual novel game \\"Doki Doki Literature Club\\" by Team Salvato with an original storyline that involves pregnancy and childbirth, which was not part of the original game content. The characters Monika, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and MC (main character/player) are all from \\"Doki Doki Literature Club,\\" which is known for its psychological horror and metafictional elements, rather than the family themes depicted in the narrative you've provided. The original game’s themes and storylines are much darker and more complex, revolving around the awareness of being in a game and the characters' struggles with their own issues and the interference of the game's script. In your narrative, you've created an alternate universe where the characters experience a significant life event; the birth of Natsuki's child, and foster a supportive and familial environment within their literature club. This kind of storytelling is common in fanfiction, where fans take characters from an existing work and create new situations and narratives that explore different aspects of those characters' relationships and lives. The conclusion of the story with a time skip to seven years later reflects the lasting impact of that event on the characters and how it brought them closer together, as well as showing Natsuki as a mother sharing the story with her child.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"in databricks, when I invoke another noteboke from the current notebook, how do i configure the compute for that notebook?","output":"In Databricks, when you want to invoke another notebook from your current notebook, you typically use the \`%run\` magic command or \`dbutils.notebook.run\` function. When you do this, the invoked notebook runs on the same cluster as the current notebook and shares the same context, which includes the same Spark session and configuration. If you want to configure specific settings for the compute used by the invoked notebook (such as different Spark configurations), you must set those configurations before you invoke the notebook since it will be using the current cluster's context. Here's how you can configure Spark settings in a Databricks notebook before invoking another notebook: \`\`\`python # Example: Configuring Spark settings spark.conf.set(\\"spark.executor.memory\\", \\"4g\\") spark.conf.set(\\"spark.executor.cores\\", \\"2\\") # Now, run the other notebook on the same cluster with these settings dbutils.notebook.run(\\"/path/to/other-notebook\\", timeout_seconds, arguments) \`\`\` However, if you need the invoked notebook to run on a separate cluster with different compute specifications, you would need to use the Databricks Jobs API to create and configure a new job that runs the notebook on a different cluster. The Jobs API allows you to specify the cluster configuration. You can create a job programmatically with the appropriate configurations and then trigger the job run from your current notebook. Here's an example of how you could use the Databricks REST API to create a new job with specific cluster settings: 1. Create a JSON payload with the job configuration, including the new cluster configuration. 2. Use \`dbutils.notebook.run\` or an HTTP library to make a POST request to the Databricks REST API endpoint to create a new job. 3. Trigger the job to run the notebook. Please note that using the Databricks REST API to create and run jobs would typically involve additional authentication steps, such as obtaining and using a Databricks personal access token. Here's a general example of how it might look in Python: \`\`\`python import requests domain = 'https://<your-databricks-workspace-url>' token = 'dapiXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'} job_config = { \\"name\\": \\"Run Other Notebook Job\\", \\"new_cluster\\": { \\"spark_version\\": \\"7.3.x-scala2.12\\", \\"node_type_id\\": \\"Standard_D3_v2\\", \\"num_workers\\": 2, # Additional cluster specs }, \\"notebook_task\\": { \\"notebook_path\\": \\"/path/to/other-notebook\\", # Pass parameters if required by the notebook \\"base_parameters\\": { \\"param1\\": \\"value1\\", \\"param2\\": \\"value2\\" } } } # API endpoint to create a new job res = requests.post(f'{domain}/api/2.0/jobs/create', headers=headers, json=job_config) job_id = res.json()['job_id'] # API endpoint to start the job with the specified job_id run_res = requests.post(f'{domain}/api/2.0/jobs/run-now', headers=headers, json={\\"job_id\\": job_id}) run_id = run_res.json()['run_id'] \`\`\` Remember to replace \`<your-databricks-workspace-url>\` and \`<your-personal-access-token>\` with your actual Databricks workspace URL and personal access token. Also, tailor the cluster and notebook configurations to your specific requirements."},{"instruction":"How to list creator of hive metastore tables in databricks?","output":"In Databricks, to find the creator of Hive metastore tables, you can often use table properties that may include metadata about the creator of the table. However, this depends on whether such metadata was recorded at the time of table creation. Databricks itself does not provide a direct way to query the creator of a table, and this information is not typically part of the Hive metastore schema. If table properties have been included at creation time and contain the creator's information, you can use a query like the following to examine the properties: \`\`\`sql DESCRIBE EXTENDED \`database_name\`.\`table_name\` \`\`\` This command will display the extended properties of a table, which may include information about the creator. Alternatively, you can use Spark SQL to get table properties programmatically: \`\`\`python table_info = spark.sql(\\"DESCRIBE EXTENDED database_name.table_name\\") table_info.show(truncate=False) \`\`\` Look for properties such as \`Owner\`, \`creator\`, or any custom property that might have been set during table creation to indicate the creator. If the information is not readily available in the table properties, another way to potentially retrieve the creator's information is through the Databricks audit logs if auditing is enabled. Databricks audit logs will contain entries for table creation events with details about the user who performed the operation. You would need access to the log files in the associated storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage), and you would then need to parse those logs to find the relevant table creation events and the users who performed them. Keep in mind that access to audit logs is often restricted to administrators or users with specific permissions. If you need access to this information and it's not available through the methods mentioned above, you may need to reach out to a Databricks workspace administrator or someone who has access to account-level logging and monitoring tools. If neither approach yields results, you may need to consider implementing a process for future table creations where metadata about the creator is explicitly stored by using table properties, or establish naming conventions that could provide hints about the creator."},{"instruction":"list hive metastore tables databricks by creator","output":"In Databricks, there is no built-in functionality that directly returns a list of Hive metastore tables created by a specific user, unless your workflow includes adding creator information as a table property when tables are created. However, there are a few methods you could explore to potentially achieve this, assuming you have the required permissions and that appropriate metadata has been recorded either within the table properties or via audit logs. # Method 1: Using Table Properties If table properties include metadata identifying the table creator, you can use Spark SQL to filter tables based on these properties. Here's a conceptual example of how you might list tables by creator: \`\`\`python from pyspark.sql import SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() catalog = spark.catalog # List all tables in a given database db_tables = catalog.listTables(\\"your_database_name\\") # This is a conceptual loop that assumes you have a property 'creator' associated with the tables creator_name = \\"specific_creator\\" for table in db_tables: # Get extended table properties table_info = spark.sql(f\\"DESCRIBE EXTENDED {table.database}.{table.name}\\").collect() # Example of how you might find the 'creator' property in the table info for row in table_info: if \\"creator\\" in row.asDict()[\\"col_name\\"] and creator_name in row.asDict()[\\"data_type\\"]: # Print or store the table information print(f\\"Table Name: {table.name} | Creator: {creator_name}\\") \`\`\` Remember that the above code is an example and would require a 'creator' property to already be present. # Method 2: Using Databricks Audit Logs Another method is to utilize the Databricks audit logs if they are enabled for your workspace. You'll need to download and parse the audit logs, looking for \`CreateTable\` or \`CreateHiveTable\` events, then filter those logs by the creator's name. \`\`\`python import json # This sample assumes you have an audit log with JSON entries for each activity, which may look like this: # {\\"action\\": \\"CreateTable\\", \\"userName\\": \\"specific_creator\\", \\"requestParams\\": {\\"database\\": \\"your_database_name\\", \\"tableName\\": \\"table_name\\"}, ...} logs = [...] # Replace this with the actual logic to load audit logs creator_name = \\"specific_creator\\" for log in logs: log_entry = json.loads(log) if log_entry[\\"action\\"] in [\\"CreateTable\\", \\"CreateHiveTable\\"] and log_entry[\\"userName\\"] == creator_name: print(f\\"Table Name: {log_entry['requestParams']['tableName']} | Creator: {creator_name}\\") \`\`\` # Method 3: Using Database Comments or Naming Conventions If you've adopted a pattern of either adding creator information within the table comments or using naming conventions that include the creator's username, you can use these patterns to identify the tables created by a particular user. The SQL statement might look something like the following, querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA or SHOW TABLES and filtering by COMMENT or name pattern: \`\`\`sql SHOW TABLES IN your_database_name \`\`\` You would then apply your logic to filter these results by the comments or naming pattern associated with a particular creator. These methods require either proactive metadata management practices or access to audit logs, which may not always be available. Without such information, it is not possible to retrieve creator details for Hive metastore tables directly from the metastore in Databricks. Hence, it is good practice to record the creator's information as part of the table metadata (e.g., properties, comments) when a table is initially created for future reference."},{"instruction":"I got \\"cors\\" error by calling a serving-endpoints that I set up in databricks. I am using power apps to make the call. How to solve it?","output":"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors occur when a web application, running in a browser, tries to make a request to a domain different from the one which served the web page, and that domain does not send back the appropriate CORS headers in its responses. The Power Apps environment is considered a different origin from your Databricks serving endpoint. To resolve CORS issues, you need to ensure that the server (in this case, the Databricks serving endpoint) allows cross-origin requests from the client domain (the origin where your Power Apps is running). To overcome the CORS issue with the Databricks serving endpoint, here are a few steps and considerations: 1. **Check if Databricks Allows CORS Configurations:** Databricks does not natively support CORS configuration on their serving endpoints. As of my last knowledge update, it wasn't possible to directly modify the CORS policy for a Databricks REST API endpoint. You may need to confirm whether this is still the case as Databricks continuously updates their platform. 2. **Use a Proxy Server:** If direct CORS configuration is not possible in Databricks, a common workaround is to use a proxy server that sits between your Power Apps and the Databricks serving endpoint. The proxy server can add the necessary CORS headers to the response. You can set up your proxy server using cloud services, like Azure Functions, AWS Lambda with API Gateway, or any other server where you can control the headers. The proxy would accept requests from Power Apps, forward them to the Databricks endpoint, and return the Databricks response to Power Apps with the CORS headers attached. 3. **Configure the Proxy to Add CORS Headers:** Your proxy service should be configured to add the necessary CORS headers to its responses. Specifically, you'll want it to set \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` to your Power Apps origin or to \`\\"*\\"\` (which means any origin, but be cautious with this for security reasons). Here is a very simplified example of what CORS header settings might look like in an Azure Functions proxy: \`\`\`csharp public static HttpResponseMessage Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log) { // Logic to call Databricks serving endpoint and get the response // Create the response var response = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK); // Add the CORS headers to the response response.Headers.Add(\\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\\", \\"https://your-power-apps-origin\\"); response.Headers.Add(\\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\\", \\"GET, POST\\"); response.Headers.Add(\\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\\", \\"Content-Type\\"); // Return the response return response; } \`\`\` 4. **Deploy and Use the Proxy:** Once the proxy is configured and deployed, update your Power Apps app to make HTTP requests to the proxy instead of directly to the Databricks serving endpoint. The proxy will then handle adding the CORS headers and forwarding the requests. Using a proxy server can introduce additional maintenance and potential latency, so it is important to keep this in mind as you develop and scale your solution. Always ensure that your proxy is secure and handles potential issues like logging and error handling adequately."},{"instruction":"Do research and find ideas to create YouTube channel with every day videos from beaches","output":"Creating a YouTube channel with daily videos featuring beaches is a unique niche that could attract viewers who love the sea, sand, and sun.

An overflow in WebAssembly memory typically happens when the memory is either: 1. Being written beyond its allocated bounds. 2. Being grown too many times without proper deallocation. Specifically looking at the \`finalizeOpcode10\` function in the given code: 1. The \`Module.decodeBlendInternal(blended)\` function is called, which creates a new ArrayBuffer and Uint8Array to hold the decoded data. 2. The \`Uint8Array.of(10, ...list)\` is then used to create a new Uint8Array with the opcode 10 as the first element, followed by the data contained in \`list\`. The use of the spread operator \`...\` could potentially create a large array if \`list\` is considerable in size. In WebAssembly, memory is linear and needs to be managed carefully. If new buffers/arrays are continuously being created without proper deallocation of previous ones, the memory usage will keep growing until it exceeds the allocated bounds and causes an overflow. When the \`HEAPU8.set()\` method is used to copy data into WebAssembly's heap memory, it is crucial to ensure that the destination area is within the bounds of allocated memory. If the \`set()\` copies data past the end of the current memory, it would also result in an overflow error. Other potential causes of errors that may lead to memory issues could be within the WebAssembly module's exported functions (\`Module.asm.j\`), which might be incorrectly managing memory or running into issues during the decoding process, causing an overflow as a side effect. To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, consider the following steps: - **Check Your Memory Allocations:** Ensure that you are not allocating more memory than necessary and that all memory is being properly freed when no longer in use. - **Debug WebAssembly Code:** Use debugging tools and techniques specific to WebAssembly to step through the execution of your WebAssembly code and watch memory allocations. - **WebAssembly Memory Growth:** Ensure that your WebAssembly module is designed to handle memory growth correctly. If memory needs to grow dynamically, make sure to handle this growth properly in your JavaScript glue code. To prevent overflows: - Avoid unbounded memory growth and ensure there are mechanisms for deallocating memory that is no longer needed. - Validate array and buffer sizes within the WebAssembly module before usage. - Monitor memory usage within the WebAssembly module and provide ample memory (consider using the \`WebAssembly.Memory\` \`grow()\` method if necessary but do it judiciously). Debugging memory issues in WebAssembly can be complex, often requiring a combination of JavaScript and WebAssembly debugging techniques, and potentially some refactoring of both the WebAssembly code and the JavaScript code that interacts with it."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artValentines Chocolate","output":"\\"Valentine's Chocolate Delight | Romantic Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift for Your Loved One\\""},{"instruction":"que signifie \\"to get swatted\\" en français ?","output":"Le terme \\"to get swatted\\" en anglais fait référence à une forme de harcèlement extrêmement dangereuse où une personne fait un faux appel aux services de police ou aux équipes d'intervention d'urgence (comme le SWAT aux États-Unis, d'où le terme \\"swatted\\"), en rapportant faussement une situation d'urgence grave comme une prise d'otage ou une fusillade active, à l'adresse de quelqu'un.

Together, the kidneys play several vital roles in maintaining homeostasis, including waste excretion, fluid balance regulation, electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation, and erythropoietin production. **Anatomy of the Kidney:** Each kidney is about the size of a fist and consists of three main parts: the cortex, medulla, and pelvis. The cortex is the outer layer where blood filtration begins; the medulla contains the renal pyramids and tubules; and the pelvis is a central collecting region that funnels urine into the ureter. Within the kidneys, the functional units are the nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately 1 million nephrons. A nephron consists of a glomerulus, which is a tiny blood-filtering capillary bed, enclosed in a capsule called Bowman's capsule. The filtered fluid then passes through a series of tubules (proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct) where further processing occurs. **Functions of the Kidney:** 1. **Waste Excretion:** The kidneys filter metabolic waste products from the blood, including urea, uric acid, creatinine, and various toxins. These substances are excreted in urine. 2. **Fluid Balance Regulation:** The kidneys adjust the volume of water excreted in the urine to maintain fluid balance in the body. They reabsorb or excrete water as needed in response to signals from hormones such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone. 3. **Electrolyte Balance:** The kidneys regulate the concentration of vital electrolytes in the blood, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and chloride. The selective reabsorption or excretion of these ions helps maintain electrolyte balance and pH levels. 4. **Blood Pressure Regulation:** The kidneys contribute to blood pressure regulation through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). When blood pressure is low, the kidneys release an enzyme called renin, which initiates a cascade resulting in the production of angiotensin II, a peptide that causes blood vessels to constrict and aldosterone release, which increases sodium and water reabsorption, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure. 5. **Erythropoietin Production:** The kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. EPO stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, which increases oxygen-carrying capacity and alleviates the hypoxia that triggered EPO production. Furthermore, the kidneys convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol, which is important for calcium absorption in the gut and maintaining bone health. In summary, the kidneys are sophisticated organs that perform critical functions essential to the survival of the organism. They filter the blood, remove waste, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, regulate blood pressure, and play a role in red blood cell production. Because of these multiple functions, kidney health is pivotal to the overall well-being of the body."},{"instruction":"Есть датасет со следующими столбцами: id сотрудника, временная метка, id турникета.

To calculate the weights of the minimum-variance portfolio (MVP) and its characteristics using Microsoft Excel, we'll follow these steps: 1. **Input Data**: Enter the variance-covariance matrix and expected returns vector into the Excel worksheet. 2. **Calculate Inverse Matrix**: Use the \`MINVERSE\` function to calculate the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix. 3. **Minimum-Variance Weights**: Use the inverse matrix to calculate the weights, this is done by multiplying the inverse matrix with a vector of ones. These weights are proportional, they will give the direction but not the exact weights just yet. 4. **Scaling Weights**: To get the actual weights, you need to divide each of the proportional weights by their sum – this ensures that the weights sum up to 1. 5. **Portfolio's Expected Return and Standard Deviation**: Calculate these parameters based on the weights you obtained. Let’s go through each of these steps: **Step 1 - Input Data:** Enter your variance-covariance matrix and expected returns in the Excel spreadsheet. You might place them like this: \`\`\` | A | B | C | A | 0.10 | 0.03 | -0.01 | B | 0.03 | 0.25 | 0.00 | C | -0.01 | 0.00 | 0.40 | \`\`\` The expected returns can go in cells E1, E2, and E3 respectively for assets A, B, and C. **Step 2 - Calculate Inverse Matrix:** Let's say your variance-covariance matrix is in cells A1:C3. To calculate its inverse, select an empty 3x3 range of cells, enter the formula \`=MINVERSE(A1:C3)\`, and hit \`Ctrl\` + \`Shift\` + \`Enter\` to enter it as an array formula (Excel will put curly braces around it). **Step 3 - Minimum-Variance Weights:** Next to the inverse matrix, place a vector of ones in a 3x1 range of cells. You can do this by entering 1 in three cells, let's say they are in cells F1, F2, and F3. Now, select another 3x1 range where you want the proportional multiplier results to go. Enter the formula \`=MMULT(YourInverseMatrixRange, F1:F3)\`, and press \`Ctrl\` + \`Shift\` + \`Enter\`. Replace \`YourInverseMatrixRange\` with the cells where your inverse matrix is. **Step 4 - Scaling Weights:** Add the values you've just computed with the MMULT function to get their sum. Then divide each of those three values by the sum to get the actual weights which sum to 1. You can put the sum in a separate cell, and for each weight, the formula will be \`=ProportionalWeight / SumCell\`. **Step 5 - Portfolio's Expected Return and Standard Deviation:** To get the expected return, use \`=MMULT(TRANSPOSE(YourActualWeightsRange),E1:E3)\`. For the standard deviation, use \`=SQRT(MMULT(MMULT(TRANSPOSE(YourActualWeightsRange), A1:C3), YourActualWeightsRange))\`. Remember to replace \`YourActualWeightsRange\`, \`E1:E3\`, and \`A1:C3\` with the appropriate cell ranges. Please note that Excel refrains from calculating MVP's strictly through the matrix inversion process when the variance-covariance matrix is not perfectly conditioned or there are constraints to the optimization problem (like minimum or maximum weights on assets). However, following the steps above with a well-conditioned variance-covariance matrix will allow you to compute the MVP within Excel's capabilities. For a practical application or more complex scenarios, one might use Solver, an Excel add-in for running optimizations, which would involve setting up an objective function (portfolio variance) and constraints (such as the weights summing to 1)."},{"instruction":"what is minverse for","output":"The \`MINVERSE\` function in Excel is used to calculate the inverse of a given square matrix, provided that the matrix is invertible. The inverse of a matrix ( A ) is denoted as ( A^{-1} ) and it has the property that when it is multiplied by ( A ), it yields the identity matrix ( I ) (a matrix with 1's on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere). In symbolic terms: [ A times A^{-1} = A^{-1} times A = I ] Matrix inversion is a key operation in many applications, including solving systems of linear equations, engineering, computer graphics, and financial calculations like computing portfolio optimization or risk management. In the context of finance, particularly in modern portfolio theory (MPT), the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix is crucial to finding the weights of the minimum-variance portfolio (MVP). It's used to calculate the portfolio that has the lowest possible variance (or standard deviation) for a set of assets, given their expected returns and correlations. Here is a recap tailored to this financial context: 1. **Why \`MINVERSE\` is needed**: To derive the weights of the MVP, the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix is necessary to transform the relationships between asset returns and their respective volatilities into weights that will minimize the overall portfolio variance. 2. **How it is used with the \`MMULT\` function**: After obtaining the inverse matrix with \`MINVERSE\`, you often need to multiply it by another matrix or vector to find the portfolio weights. This is where the \`MMULT\` function comes in—to perform the matrix multiplication. 3. **Normalization of weights**: Once you have the proportional weights (which may not sum up to 1 yet), you need to scale them so that the sum of all the weights is equal to one, effectively normalizing the portfolio to reflect a fully invested strategy. Keep in mind that if the matrix is not invertible (i.e., if it is singular or not well-conditioned), Excel's \`MINVERSE\` function will return an error. The singularity of a matrix can often indicate that there is a perfect linear relationship (collinearity) between some of the assets in the portfolio, which in a real-world setting indicates redundancy or a need for additional diversification."},{"instruction":"why the vector is equal to 1","output":"In the context of finding the minimum variance portfolio weights using the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix, a vector of ones is used as a practical step in the optimization process. Here's a more detailed explanation of its role in this context: When you are trying to find the portfolio with the lowest possible variance given no expected return target, you ultimately need to solve a quadratic optimization problem that minimizes the portfolio variance subject to the constraint that the sum of the portfolio weights equals 1 (the entire capital is invested). The objective function for portfolio variance is a quadratic function of the weights: [ text{Minimize: } w^T Sigma w ] Subject to: [ mathbf{1}^T w = 1 ] Where: - ( w ) is the vector of portfolio weights, - ( Sigma ) is the variance-covariance matrix of asset returns, - ( mathbf{1} ) is a vector of ones (representing that the sum of weights is 1). The analytical solution to this optimization problem involves the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix ( Sigma ). The vector of ones comes into play when we apply the formula to get the initial set of portfolio weights: [ w_{proportional} = Sigma^{-1} mathbf{1} ] This gives us a set of proportional weights that point towards the direction of minimum variance but are not yet scaled to sum up to 1. To scale them, we divide each weight by the sum of all proportional weights: [ w = frac{w_{proportional}}{mathbf{1}^T w_{proportional}} ] To ensure that the weights add up to 100% of the portfolio, the sum of the weights must be constrained to equal 1. This is a standard constraint in portfolio optimization that reflects a fully invested portfolio without any borrowing (leverage) or uninvested cash. In summary, the vector of ones is used in the calculation of the minimum variance portfolio to satisfy the constraint that all the money available must be fully invested across the portfolio assets, translating the sum of weights to equal one."},{"instruction":"correlation coefficient purpose","output":"The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that calculates the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. In finance, and specifically in portfolio theory, the correlation coefficient is used to understand the relationship between the returns of different assets. The purpose of the correlation coefficient in finance includes: 1. **Risk Diversification**: - By selecting assets that are not perfectly correlated, investors can create portfolios that may have lower overall risk than the risk inherent in holding any single asset. Diversification benefits are driven by the lack of perfect correlation between assets. 2. **Understanding Relationships**: - The correlation coefficient provides insights into how assets might behave relative to each other under different market conditions. Positive correlation means assets tend to move in the same direction, while negative correlation indicates that assets move in opposite directions. 3. **Portfolio Optimization**: - In the process of creating an efficient frontier, the correlation coefficient helps in identifying the optimal mix of assets that yields the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. 4. **Performance Attribution**: - Correlation analysis can help in understanding whether similar assets or funds are providing similar sources of risk and return, which is useful for attribution analysis and for identifying redundant holdings. 5. **Macro-Economic Analysis**: - Correlation coefficients can be used to analyze how different asset classes respond to macroeconomic variables or market events. This helps in constructing portfolios that are resilient to various economic cycles or market disruptions. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1: - A coefficient of 1 implies a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one asset increases in value, the other one does as well, in a linear fashion. - A coefficient of 0 implies no correlation, indicating that the returns on the two assets do not move in tandem. - A coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, where one asset increases in value and the other decreases in perfect opposition. In portfolio construction, it is often desirable to mix assets with low or negative correlations to each other. This strategy aims to reduce the overall risk (volatility) of the portfolio, because when one asset might perform poorly, another might do well, and this balancing acts can smooth out the return profile of the investment portfolio."},{"instruction":"correlation coefficient between the portfolio and each asset.","output":"The correlation coefficient between a portfolio and any individual asset within the portfolio gives you an idea of how closely the performance of that asset is related to the overall performance of the portfolio. It represents the extent to which the return of the asset contributes to the portfolio's return. To calculate the correlation coefficient between an individual asset and a portfolio, you need to have time series data of returns for the asset and the portfolio over the same time periods. Here's how you can compute these correlation coefficients, using the formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient: 1. Calculate the returns for the asset and the portfolio for each time period. 2. Determine the average return for the asset and for the portfolio over all time periods. 3. Calculate the deviations of each return from its mean value for both the asset and the portfolio. 4. Multiply these deviations for each time period (Asset deviation * Portfolio deviation) and sum the results. 5. Calculate the standard deviation for the asset returns and for the portfolio returns. 6. Normalize the sum of the products of deviations by dividing it by the product of the two standard deviations and the number of observations (less 1 if you're using sample standard deviations). The formula for the correlation coefficient (( r )) is: [ r = frac{sum{(R_{ai} - bar{R}_a)(R_{pi} - bar{R}_p)}}{sqrt{sum{(R_{ai} - bar{R}_a)^2} sum{(R_{pi} - bar{R}_p)^2}}} ] Where: - ( R_{ai} ) = Return of asset i in a given time period - ( bar{R}_a ) = Average return of the asset across all time periods - ( R_{pi} ) = Return of the portfolio in the same time period - ( bar{R}_p ) = Average return of the portfolio across all time periods In the context of Microsoft Excel, you can use the CORREL function to calculate this correlation coefficient. Place your asset returns in one column and the portfolio returns in another. Then, use the formula \`=CORREL(column1, column2)\` replacing column1 and column2 with the actual ranges where the returns are. Please note that if the asset in question is part of the portfolio, the correlation coefficient will typically be positive and may be quite high, as the asset's performance directly impacts the performance of the portfolio. However, if the asset has a low weight within the portfolio, the correlation might be lower, reflecting that the asset has less influence on the portfolio's returns."},{"instruction":"Expected R Standard dev Cor Sec1 Cor Sec2 Cor Sec3 Cor Sec4 Security 1 15,00% 13,00% 1,00 0, 30 0, 80 0, 10 Security 2 17,00% 17,00% 0,30 1,00 0,30 0,20 Security 3 23,00% 20,00% 0,80 0,30 1,00 0,50 Security 4 26,00% 32,00% 0,10 0,20 0,50 1,00 r = 5,00% Market portfolio:w1= 38,3467% w2= 31,0724% w3= 14,888% Efficient frontier of risky securities a= 0,13080975 b= 0,44407014 c= 0,00441037 R = a + （b*σ^2 − c）^1/2 a) Is asset 4 included in the market portfolio?

You have given the weights for the market portfolio as follows: - Security 1: w1 = 38,3467% - Security 2: w2 = 31,0724% - Security 3: w3 = 14,888% These weights represent the proportion of each security in the market portfolio. To determine if Security 4 is included, we would expect to see a weight assigned to it (w4). However, there is no weight provided for Security 4. The risk-free asset's weight in the market portfolio can be inferred by checking if the total weight of all risky assets equals 100%. If not, the remainder can be assumed to be the weight of the risk-free asset. Let's calculate: Total weight of provided risky securities = w1 + w2 + w3 Total weight = 38,3467% + 31,0724% + 14,888% Total weight = 84,3071% Since the total weight of the three securities provided is less than 100%, the remaining percentage can be assumed to be the weight of Security 4 and the risk-free asset combined.

The formula for the standard deviation of a three-asset portfolio is: [ sigma_p = sqrt{w_1^2 sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 sigma_2^2 + w_3^2 sigma_3^2 + 2(w_1w_2rho_{12}sigma_1sigma_2 + w_1w_3rho_{13}sigma_1sigma_3 + w_2w_3rho_{23}sigma_2sigma_3)} ] Since we don't have the weight of Security 4, we'll proceed by either assuming its weight is the remainder (15,6929%) or disregarding it if the market portfolio is strictly composed of Security 1, 2, and 3. Without the standard deviation contribution from Security 4, we cannot compute an accurate standard deviation for the overall market portfolio. However, assuming the market portfolio includes only these three securities, their contribution to the portfolio's variance can be computed, but we would lack the full picture. - **Sharpe Ratio**: The Sharpe ratio is calculated by taking the difference between the expected portfolio return and the risk-free rate, and then dividing by the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return: [ text{Sharpe Ratio} = frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{sigma_p} ] Where ( R_f ) is the risk-free rate, which, in your example, is 5% or 0.05. # c) Efficiency frontier and Capital Market Line (CML): Plotting the efficiency frontier and the CML requires numerous calculations of expected returns and standard deviations for various portfolios. Then you plot these to form a curve (the efficiency frontier) showing the best possible return for a given level of risk. The CML is a straight line starting at the risk-free rate and tangent to the efficiency frontier at the market portfolio. # d) Beta of Security 3 and its risk decomposition: - **Beta**: The beta of Security 3 relative to the market portfolio is a measure of how much Security 3's returns are expected to change relative to a change in the market portfolio's returns. Beta is defined as: [ beta_3 = frac{text{Cov}(R_3, R_m)}{text{Var}(R_m)} ] This formula requires the covariance of Security 3's returns with the market's returns and the variance of the market's returns. Without concrete returns data, it's not possible to calculate these values directly. - **Decomposition into Specific and Systematic Risk**: - **Systematic Risk** is the risk inherent to the entire market and is captured by the beta of the security. - **Specific (idiosyncratic) Risk** is the portion of a security's risk that is unique to that security and not correlated with the market. It can be calculated as: [ text{Specific Risk} = text{Total Risk} - text{Systematic Risk} ] # e) Mrs. Lewis's Position: If Mrs. Lewis is currently invested in Asset 4 and wants to maintain the same level of risk but potentially improve her returns, she could consider investing in a portfolio that lies on the efficient frontier. Without data on the returns and standard deviations of combinations of these assets, it's not possible to give a precise answer or plot the graph. In practice, she could use a combination of these securities to reach an optimal point that offers better returns for the same level of risk. To visualize this, you would need to plot the efficient frontier on a graph with expected return on the y-axis and standard deviation (risk) on the x-axis. Mrs. Lewis's current position would be a point representing Asset 4's risk and return. The optimal portfolio for her, assuming she doesn't want more risk, would be at the point where a vertical line from Asset 4's risk intersects the efficient frontier."},{"instruction":"f) Suppose now that there is a risk-free asset as well. Answer the questions in points e). Specify the composition of the investment that could improve her position. What fraction of her portfolio would be invested in security 4? g) What if she wanted to improve her position maintaining the same expected return of 32% (assuming that a risk-free asset exists)? Specify the composition of the investment that could improve her position.","output":"# f) Assuming there is a risk-free asset: When there is a risk-free asset available for investment, the portfolio choice changes significantly. Investors can now choose to invest in a combination of the risk-free asset and a tangent portfolio (often the market portfolio) that lies on the efficient frontier. This allows them to achieve any desired level of risk by changing the proportion of the investment between the risk-free and the tangent portfolio. For Mrs. Lewis: If Mrs. Lewis is currently invested in Security 4, which we know has an expected return of 26% and a standard deviation of 32%, and she wants to improve her position, she can create a combination of Security 4 and the risk-free asset (let's say the risk-free rate is 5%). She could lend (invest in the risk-free asset) or borrow at the risk-free rate to adjust the risk-return profile of her investment. To do this, she would leverage or combine her investment in Security 4 with the risk-free asset to aim for any point on the Capital Market Line (CML), which starts from the risk-free rate and is tangent to the efficient frontier. The composition of her improved position would involve determining the exact mix of the risk-free asset and Security 4. This cannot be determined without further data on the exact allocations and the expected return and risk of the tangent portfolio (if Security 4 is not the tangent portfolio itself). However, if we assume Security 4 is part of the market portfolio and not a standalone investment, then we align with the CML's allocations. # g) If Mrs. Lewis desired to maintain the same expected return of 32%: If Mrs. Lewis wishes to retain the same level of expected return but with less risk involved (assuming Security 4 offers that exact expected return rate), she could improve her position by investing part of her funds in the risk-free asset and the rest in the market portfolio, rather than all in Security 4. She would end up on the CML, which represents the opportunity set that provides the highest return per unit of risk, and thus lower her risk below that of Security 4 alone while maintaining the same return. To calculate the exact composition, we’d use the following formulas: [ w_{rf} = frac{(E(R_m) - E(R_4))}{E(R_m) - R_f} ] [ w_{m} = 1 - w_{rf} ] Where: - ( E(R_m) ) is the expected return of the market portfolio - ( E(R_4) ) is the desired expected return (32% provided by Mrs. Lewis) - ( R_f ) is the risk-free rate - ( w_{rf} ) is the weight invested in the risk-free asset - ( w_{m} ) is the weight invested in the market portfolio Please note that actual investment decision would require a deeper analysis of Mrs. Lewis's risk preference, the market conditions, as well as the full set of available investment opportunities, which would likely involve numerous assets and not only Security 4 and the risk-free asset. The above calculations are a simplification to illustrate what might be done with the given information."},{"instruction":"what is the standard deviation of the market portfolio asked question b?","output":"Based on the provided information, we can calculate the standard deviation of the market portfolio, which is composed of securities 1, 2, and 3, with the given weights. The standard deviation of the portfolio depends on the individual variances of the securities, the weights of each security in the portfolio, and the pairwise correlations between them. For a three-asset portfolio, the variance (σ²) can be calculated using the following formula: [ sigma_p^2 = w_1^2 cdot sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 cdot sigma_2^2 + w_3^2 cdot sigma_3^2 + 2 cdot w_1 cdot w_2 cdot rho_{12} cdot sigma_1 cdot sigma_2 + 2 cdot w_1 cdot w_3 cdot rho_{13} cdot sigma_1 cdot sigma_3 + 2 cdot w_2 cdot w_3 cdot rho_{23} cdot sigma_2 cdot sigma_3 ] Using the given information, we can plug in the values: - ( w_1 = 38.3467% = 0.383467 ) - ( w_2 = 31.0724% = 0.310724 ) - ( w_3 = 14.888% = 0.14888 ) - ( sigma_1 = 13% = 0.13 ) - ( sigma_2 = 17% = 0.17 ) - ( sigma_3 = 20% = 0.20 ) - ( rho_{12} = 0.30 ) - ( rho_{13} = 0.80 ) - ( rho_{23} = 0.30 ) Let's compute the variance: [ sigma_p^2 = (0.383467)^2 cdot (0.13)^2 + (0.310724)^2 cdot (0.17)^2 + (0.14888)^2 cdot (0.20)^2 + 2 cdot (0.383467) cdot (0.310724) cdot (0.30) cdot (0.13) cdot (0.17) + 2 cdot (0.383467) cdot (0.14888) cdot (0.80) cdot (0.13) cdot (0.20) + 2 cdot (0.310724) cdot (0.14888) cdot (0.30) cdot (0.17) cdot (0.20) ] Now, let's perform the calculations (remembering to use parentheses for correct order of operations): [ sigma_p^2 = 0.0194749225 + 0.0088381977 + 0.0008870142 + 0.003862398 + 0.0052652412 + 0.0005201113 ] [ sigma_p^2 = 0.0194749225 + 0.0088381977 + 0.0008870142 + 0.003862398 + 0.0052652412 + 0.0005201113 ] [ sigma_p^2 ≈ 0.038848 ] Now, take the square root to find the standard deviation: [ sigma_p = sqrt{sigma_p^2} ] [ sigma_p ≈ sqrt{0.038848} ] [ sigma_p ≈ 0.1971 ] So, the standard deviation of the market portfolio, considering only the three securities, is approximately 19.71%.

Decompose it into specific and systematic risk. What is the risk brought to the market portfolio by security 3?","output":"The beta of a security measures its sensitivity to market movements and is a part of systematic risk—one that affects all securities in the market. Systematic risk is the inherent risk associated with the overall market movements that any individual security or portfolio cannot avoid. To calculate the beta (( beta )) of Security 3 with respect to the market portfolio, we can use the formula: [ beta_3 = frac{text{Cov}(R_3, R_m)}{sigma_m^2} ] Where: - ( text{Cov}(R_3, R_m) ) is the covariance between the return of Security 3 and the return of the market portfolio, - ( sigma_m^2 ) is the variance of the market portfolio. The covariance can be estimated using the correlation between Security 3 and the market as follows: [ text{Cov}(R_3, R_m) = rho_{3m} cdot sigma_3 cdot sigma_m ] Where ( rho_{3m} ) is the correlation between Security 3 and the market portfolio, ( sigma_3 ) is the standard deviation of Security 3, and ( sigma_m ) is the standard deviation of the market portfolio. Using the information previously calculated, the beta of Security 3 can be expressed as: [ beta_3 = rho_{3m} cdot frac{sigma_3}{sigma_m} ] Unfortunately, you haven’t provided the direct correlation between Security 3 and the market portfolio (( rho_{3m} )), but if we treat the weights and returns of the given securities as representing the market portfolio, we can attempt an estimate. If we approximate the correlation of Security 3 to the market by using its correlation with the other securities, and treat the portfolio as if it were composed only of those securities, we would use the correlations provided between Security 3 and Securities 1 and 2 for this purpose. But without explicit guidance on this, it's speculative. To decompose the risk of Security 3 into specific and systematic components: - **Systematic Risk** is captured by ( beta ) and represents the market-related or non-diversifiable risk. - **Total Risk** of Security 3 can be expressed as the variance of its returns (( sigma_3^2 )). - **Specific Risk (Idiosyncratic or Unsystematic Risk)** is the part of Security 3's total risk that is not explained by market movements, which is the total risk minus the systematic risk. It can be calculated as: [ text{Specific Risk}^2 = sigma_3^2 - (beta_3^2 cdot sigma_m^2) ] To actually compute the values, specific data is necessary, or approximations must be made using average correlations if the actual market portfolio data is unavailable or if the proxy portfolio (as composed of the given securities) is used. Once we know the beta of Security 3, the risk that Security 3 contributes to the market portfolio is both its systematic and specific risk. In a diversified portfolio, the specific risk tends to be minimized, leaving beta as the main measure of the asset's contribution to overall portfolio risk. Investors are generally rewarded for bearing systematic risk, but not specific risk, which can be diversified away."},{"instruction":"Question 1. Suppose you perform an empirical test of the CAPM using an international index as a proxy for the market portfolio which includes assets from US and European Markets. You obtain that the index returns is not the single determinant of asset returns. What would you conclude?","output":"If an empirical test of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using an international index as a proxy for the market portfolio shows that the index return is not the single determinant of asset returns, it might lead to several possible conclusions: 1. **CAPM Limitations**: The CAPM is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold true in real-world markets. For example, it assumes that investors have homogeneous expectations, can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate, and only care about mean and variance of returns. If the international index returns are not the sole determinant of asset returns, it may indicate that some of the CAPM's underlying assumptions do not hold in the international context. 2. **Market Inefficiency**: One of the key assumptions of CAPM is that markets are efficient and all available information is reflected in asset prices. If other factors aside from the market index returns are influencing asset returns, it might suggest market inefficiencies that are not captured by the CAPM. 3. **Multi-Factor Models**: The result could suggest that multi-factor models, such as the Fama-French three-factor model or Carhart four-factor model, might be more appropriate for explaining asset returns. These models incorporate factors such as size, value, momentum, in addition to market risk, which may play significant roles in the returns of assets, especially in an international context. 4. **Differences between Local and Global Risks**: The international index reflects a combination of US and European market risks. However, there could be local or regional risks and factors that affect asset returns which are not captured by a broad international index. 5. **Emerging Market Risks**: If the international index includes assets from both developed and emerging markets, the risks associated with emerging markets—such as political risk, differing legal and regulatory environments, or currency risk—may not be fully captured by the index. 6. **Data Issues or Model Misspecification**: The result may stem from data-related issues like errors in data collection, issues with frequency or period of analysis, or problems with the methodology used to conduct the test. There could also be a model misspecification, where relevant variables are omitted or the proxy used for the market index is not representative of the true market portfolio. 7. **Sectors/Countries Diversification Effect**: The index could be heavily weighted toward certain industries or countries which might bring in diversification effects that the CAPM does not account for. This diversification might limit the power of the CAPM to identify the market portfolio as the single determinant of asset returns. Given this outcome, further research would be needed to identify additional factors that influence asset returns and to explore whether alternative asset pricing models or adjustments to the CAPM would produce better results. The goal would be to find a model that more accurately reflects the complex dynamics of international asset returns, possibly incorporating other systematic risk factors or market inefficiencies."},{"instruction":"Question 2. Is it true that in a perfectly efficient market no investor would be able to earn a profit?","output":"In a perfectly efficient market, as described by the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), it is not true that no investor would be able to earn a profit. Instead, what the EMH suggests is that no investor would be able to consistently achieve returns greater than average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis through active trading based on available information. The EMH posits that all available information is already reflected in asset prices. Therefore, stocks always trade at their fair market value, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. There are three forms of the EMH: 1. **Weak Form**: All past market prices and data are fully reflected in asset prices. According to the weak form, investors cannot earn excess returns using technical analysis. 2. **Semi-Strong Form**: All publicly available information is fully reflected in asset prices, not just past prices. According to the semi-strong form, investors cannot earn excess returns using fundamental analysis. 3. **Strong Form**: All information, both public and private, is fully reflected in asset prices. According to the strong form, even insider information cannot help an investor earn excess returns. In reality, while markets may be efficient to a great extent, they are not perfectly so. There are numerous instances of anomalies, mispricings, and instances where investors can and do earn excess profits, whether through information asymmetries, market inefficiencies, or skill. Investors can still make profits in an efficient market due to: - **Randomness**: Some investors will outperform by chance, even if they cannot do so systematically over the long term. - **Risk Compensation**: The EMH does not eliminate the risk-return tradeoff. Investors can still earn higher returns by assuming greater risk. For example, by investing in stocks with a higher beta, which tend to display higher volatility. - **Market Mechanisms**: Dividend payments and capital gains resulting from overall market growth provide opportunities for profit. These avenues for returns don't involve beating the market and are consistent with market efficiency. - **Event-Driven Strategies**: Some strategies that respond to new information or market events, such as arbitrage opportunities, may lead to profits even in an efficient market, mainly due to the time it takes for information to be reflected in prices. - **Index Funds**: Index funds aim to match the market return by replicating indices and thus provide the average market return before fees. This isn't \\"beating\\" the market, but it is profit-making within the confines of efficient market theory. Therefore, the EMH doesn't imply that investors can't make a profit. It implies that outperforming the market, after accounting for transaction costs and risk, is not something investors can do consistently over time through skill or information exploitation. Profits from broad market performance, dividends, and taking on additional risk are still possible."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motor Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2001?","output":"Sure, creating satirical slogans involves using humor, irony, or exaggeration to critique or poke fun at a subject.

However, to answer your question more directly, in reality, if someone were to grab the door handle of a 2002 Dodge—or any vehicle—too hard, there could be a few outcomes, depending on the condition of the vehicle and the materials used: 1. **Nothing Unusual:** In most cases, nothing out of the ordinary would happen. Car door handles are designed to withstand the normal force of being pulled and should handle a firm grip without issue. 2. **Handle Breakage:** If the vehicle has aged and the materials have become brittle, or if there is an existing weakness or defect within the door handle mechanism, it is possible that the handle could break. 3. **Misalignment or Damage:** Excessive force could potentially cause misalignment in the door mechanism or damage to the surrounding door panel, especially if the car has been poorly maintained or exposed to harsh environments that could lead to corrosion or weakening of materials. 4. **Door Won't Open:** If the car handle mechanism is already compromised due to wear and tear or a previous issue, pulling too hard could result in a door that won't open because the handle mechanism might fail to engage properly. It's worth noting that while the mention of a 2002 Dodge might imply that this was a specific issue for Dodge vehicles of that era, any used car, especially one that is many years old, could potentially face similar problems due to wear, environmental factors, and maintenance history.

Write all of this, and add some other details, in realistic and logical way.","output":"In the late 15th century, amidst the flourishing of the Renaissance, a lesser-known but remarkable tale unfolded, featuring an Italian knight by the name of Giovanni Domenico Campanella. Born in 1450 in the Republic of Genoa, a maritime hub renowned for its seafaring prowess, Campanella exhibited an early interest in global exploration and trade. Campanella became a knight at the age of twenty and quickly gained repute for his skill in combat and diplomacy. Seeking adventure and wealth, he convinced Genoese nobles to back an audacious plan — to establish a trade route with the distant and exotic land of Japan, about which very little was known in Europe at the time. His timing was impeccable, as Genoa craved new trading partners after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople disrupted traditional routes. In 1475, Campanella embarked on his voyage, reaching Japan after an arduous journey that included stopovers in India and China. He arrived during the Sengoku period, a time of great civil unrest and the rise of samurai power. The Italian knight's exotic appearance and knowledge of Western technology and warfare earned him an audience with a powerful daimyo, or feudal lord, in the Kyushu region. Campanella, through a combination of relentless perseverance, shrewd negotiation, and a curiosity respectful of Japanese culture, succeeded in securing a trade agreement. The promise of European goods like Venetian glass and firearms piqued the interest of the daimyo, who foresaw how trade could bolster his resources and power. It was during his time in Japan that Campanella met Kaida, a kunoichi (female ninja) in the service of the daimyo. Kaida, skilled in espionage and assassination, was initially wary of this foreign knight. However, as they interacted over time, they developed a mutual respect and, eventually, a secret romance blossomed between them. Their love was threatened when a rival daimyo learned of the valuable new trade route and sought to eliminate Campanella, seeing him as the linchpin of his enemy's newfound advantage. The Italian's combat skill was tested when an ambush was laid for him during a journey between castles. It was Kaida who saved Campanella, having intercepted whispers of the assassination plot. Using her shinobi skills, she infiltrated the ambushers' camp and warned him just in time. Together, they fought valiantly, turning the tables on the would-be assassins. Although they won the battle, Campanella was gravely wounded. Under Kaida's care and using her vast knowledge of traditional medicine, Campanella eventually recovered. Knowing that remaining in Japan posed great danger to them both, they decided to leave. With heavy hearts, they faked Campanella's death to escape the watchful eyes of their enemies and set off for Italy. The voyage back was fraught with hardships, but the two made it to Italian shores in 1478. There, Campanella introduced Kaida as his wife. The exotic couple was a curiosity in Genoa, but they were accepted, thanks in part to Campanella's elevated status due to the doors he had opened for Genoese trade. Campanella and Kaida settled in a peaceful estate where they lived out their days. He continued to aid Genoa in expanding its trade routes, and she adapted to her new life, though she always kept her shinobi roots in mind. Their story, often regarded as fanciful myth by contemporary scholars, was recorded in private journals and letters. Giovanni Domenico Campanella lived to the ripe age of 89, dying in 1539. Kaida, his devoted partner and savior, lived only a few years less, having shared a life that seemed as much a fairy tale as it did a series of historic firsts in cultural exchange. Their story is a testament to the idea that, sometimes, fact can indeed be stranger—and more captivating—than fiction."},{"instruction":"rewrite, but give Kaida an even more Japanese name.","output":"In the latter part of the 15th century, a curious tale unfolded, interweaving the fate of an Italian knight with the emerging narrative of global exploration that would come to define the subsequent Age of Discovery. Giovanni Domenico Campanella, born in 1450 in the prominent maritime Republic of Genoa, stood as a paragon of courage and ambition in a time when the known world was rapidly expanding. As a young knight impassioned by tales of far-off lands, Campanella envisioned an unprecedented venture — forging a direct trade route between Italy and the distant and enigmatic islands of Japan. Genoa, his hometown, in pursuit of novel trading avenues and eager to sidestep the chokehold the Ottoman Empire had on Eastern trade, proved fertile ground for his aspirations. In 1475, backed by Genoese patrons, Campanella set sail on an odyssey that would carry him to the shores of Japan, traversing the exotic locales of India and China along the way. When he finally arrived, the foreign knight found himself in the midst of the tumultuous Sengoku period, an era marked by feuding samurai lords and political intrigue. Utilizing his charm, diplomatic acumen, and offerings of European innovations, Campanella gained favor with a Kyushu daimyo, securing a fragile but promising trade pact. In return, he promised the delivery of coveted European commodities like fine textiles and armaments. During his residence, Campanella encountered Ayame, a kunoichi of exceptional skill serving under the daimyo. Though trained in subterfuge and lethality, Ayame found herself intrigued by the peculiar foreigner whose presence had begun to alter the course of local power dynamics. Through time, a tender and passionate bond developed between the knight and the shinobi, transcending their vastly different worlds. The Italian's success, however, drew the ire of rival factions who perceived the burgeoning trade route as a threat. A violent plot was concocted to assassinate Campanella, to sever the flow of Western advantages into the hands of their adversary. It was Ayame who discovered and thwarted the murderous scheme. Employing her stealth, she unraveled the plan and warned Campanella, joining him in a preemptive defense. In the grim melee that ensued, Campanella was grievously injured. Ayame's swift intervention and her knowledge of medicinal herbs and treatments saved his life. Convinced that their future in Japan was overshadowed by constant peril, the pair plotted a clandestine departure. They staged Campanella's demise and embarked on the treacherous journey back to Italy. The couple endured many trials, but the shores of Genoa welcomed Campanella and Ayame in 1478. Presented as his wife, Ayame's transition into Genoese society was a curiosity, yet her grace and the couple's evident love garnered acceptance. Campanella's estate became their sanctuary, from which he continued to advise on maritime trade while Ayame embraced her new environment, never fully relinquishing her shinobi heritage. Their unique partnership, chronicled in private correspondences, invited skepticism from historians, but their legacy hinted at a world where boundaries were fluid, and astonishing lives could unfold. Living to his eighty-ninth year, Giovanni Domenico Campanella passed away in 1539, with Ayame, his companion and guardian, following only a few years later. Their lives stood as a poignant emblem to the fact that reality can often eclipse the imaginings of fiction in its wonder and profound depths of connection."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Stellantis Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2002 (Despite Stellantis Not Existing In 2002)?","output":"Certainly! Stellantis is a multinational automotive manufacturing corporation formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the PSA Group. Even though Stellantis didn't exist in 2002, we can have some fun imagining what satirical slogans their divisions might have used back then, based on the design and public perception of their vehicles during that time. Keep in mind these are meant in good humor and are satirical: 1. **Chrysler - \\"Innovating cup holders since 2002, because where else will you put your supersize drink?\\"** - A playful jab at Chrysler's focus on interior features like their well-known multiple cup holders while their designs and mechanics were sometimes criticized. 2. **Dodge - \\"Because 'subtlety' is not in our dictionary. Dodge - Go bold or go home!\\"** - Dodge's designs in 2002 tended to be muscular, bold, and aggressive, which this slogan humorously accentuates. 3. **Jeep - \\"Jeep: Selling the dream of off-roading, one suburban driveway at a time.\\"** - Jeep is known for their rugged off-road capabilities, which is often a selling point, even if many owners mainly use them for on-road, everyday use. 4. **Fiat - \\"Fiat: Mastering the fine art of compactness and the mysteries of electronics.\\"** - Fiat cars were compact and stylish, but during the 2000s they faced some stereotypes regarding electronic reliability. 5. **Peugeot - \\"Daring you to pronounce our name correctly with every model.\\"** - This isn't about design but rather a playful nod to the fact that the Peugeot brand name is often mispronounced, especially outside of Europe. 6. **Citroën - \\"Citroën: Because 'quirky' is just another word for 'innovative'.\\"** - Citroën has been known for unique, sometimes peculiar design features that make its cars stand out. 7. **Opel/Vauxhall - \\"Engineering excitement... just don't look under the hood.\\"** - Opel/Vauxhall offered practical designs that often lacked the excitement promised by automotive advancements of the time. 8. **Alfa Romeo - \\"Alfa Romeo: Because who cares about reliability when you look this good?\\"** - This Italian brand is famed for its beauty and driving passion but was also plagued by a reputation for reliability issues during that era. 9. **Lancia - \\"Lancia: When you want exclusivity... in the repair shop.\\"** - Lancia has a storied history and was known for its exclusivity, but also, unfortunately, for spending a lot of time in maintenance. Remember, this is a tongue-in-cheek look at some of the perceptions of these brands as they were in 2002, and many of these companies have evolved significantly since then."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2007 And Their Meaning?","output":"Creating satirical slogans requires a blend of humor and critique that highlights certain characteristics or stereotypes associated with the brands during the time period in question. In 2007, American car companies were often critiqued for their design language, quality of materials, fuel efficiency, and innovation when compared to their foreign counterparts. Please note that the following slogans are intended for satirical purposes and do not represent the companies' actual slogans or branding efforts. 1. Ford: \\"Ford - Bold Moves, in the Wrong Direction!\\" Meaning: A play on Ford's actual slogan \\"Bold Moves,\\" this satirical version pokes fun at decisions and designs that were seen as out of touch with consumer needs at the time, particularly their focus on larger, fuel-inefficient vehicles. 2. Chevrolet: \\"Chevy - An American Revolution, Circular and Never-Ending.\\" Meaning: This slogan riffs on Chevy's \\"An American Revolution\\" campaign, satirizing the idea that Chevrolet's design changes were minimal and cyclical, rather than truly revolutionary. 3. Dodge: \\"Dodge - Grab Life by the Horns, Hope it's Not a Bull.\\" Meaning: Lampooning Dodge's \\"Grab life by the horns\\" slogan, this makes fun of the idea that although Dodge vehicles were bold and powerful, they might also be difficult to control or impractical, similar to a wild bull. 4. Chrysler: \\"Chrysler - Inspiration Comes Standard, Quality Optional.\\" Meaning: While Chrysler aimed to present itself as an inspired and premium brand, critics often cited gaps in quality and craftsmanship, hence the play on \\"standard\\" inspiration but \\"optional\\" quality. 5. GMC: \\"GMC - Like a Rock, Sinks Like One Too.\\" Meaning: A twist on Chevy's \\"Like a Rock\\" slogan (often associated with their trucks, including GMC), here it insinuates that their heavy and less fuel-efficient vehicles were as impractical as sinking rocks, especially in the context of rising fuel prices. 6. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac - Break Through, or Just Break Down.\\" Meaning: Although Cadillac tried to reinvent itself as a marquee of luxury and performance with the \\"Break Through\\" slogan, there might have been perceptions that reliability took a backseat to these claims. 7. Hummer: \\"Hummer - Go Anywhere, Park Nowhere.\\" Meaning: Hummer was known for its large, military-inspired vehicles with exceptional off-road capabilities, but the slogan mocks the impracticality of parking such a large vehicle in everyday situations. 8. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac - Designed for Action, Destined for the Auction.\\" Meaning: A nod to Pontiac's sporty aspirations (“Designed for Action”), but with the reality that many models didn't hold their value well, ending up frequently at car auctions. Always keep in mind that satire is a form of humor that includes exaggerating or altering the characteristics of the subject to highlight its flaws or ironies. These imaginary slogans are merely for entertainment and do not reflect the current or past strategies of these car companies."},{"instruction":"Write an dialogue-filled, military-action-filled exposition-filled Japanese light novel style combined with American pulp military espionage action/technothriller 1980s-early 2000s style excerpt for a crossover fanfic between Call of Duty, the shared universe of Tom Clancey’s books and video games and Medaka Box in which the Ghosts of Call of Duty: Ghosts and the Ghosts of Ghost Recon are the same military division and the Division of the Division video game series has a foreign intelligence division.

Synchronize watches. We go dark in thirty seconds. Remember, this isn't just about Hakoniwa – we're pulling at threads of a global conspiracy here.\\" \\"Roger that, Ghost,\\" replied Alex Mason, the burned operative whose past haunted him as much as the disenfranchised specters he now commanded. He adjusted his night vision goggles, the green glow illuminating his determined features. Operative Sam Fisher, a legend in the shadows, checked his SC-20K M.A.W.S. before confirming, \\"And if we encounter hostiles?\\" \\"Non-lethal takedowns, unless compromised.\\" Mason replied, reloading his XM25 for precise countermeasures. Across the way, deep within their hidden safe house, a Division agent known only as Nomad studied their intelligence. \\"Looks like they're proceeding with the extraction. We need to hit the neo-Soviets and the neo-Wilsonians before they can regroup.\\" A nod from Nomad's ally, an agent with ice in his veins named Scott, signified agreement. \\"Our Division's been infiltrated, but we still stand for something.

Hansode Shiranui, her blue eyes glowing with unspoken emotions, finally confessed to her childhood friend Zenkichi, \\"Zenkichi, I've always... always loved you!\\" Stunned by the revelation, Zenkichi barely managed to reply, \\"Hansode... I—\\" Before he could finish, Mogana Kikaijima interrupted, suddenly emboldened, \\"Zenkichi! I won't lose! I love you, too!\\" Their confessions were a cacophony of pent-up desires, but they failed to notice the tense atmosphere among the students, nor the silent shadows moving beyond the dorm's fringes. --- Medaka Kurokami, watching from afar, was just about to step forward and add her voice to the romantic fray when the night exploded with the precision of the Ghosts' assault. Infiltrating the scientific facilities like wraiths, the elite soldiers systematically dismantled Hakoniwa's Flask Plan operations. At the crucial moment, a soldier's head cam - unintentionally, of course - streamed the love-stricken tableau into the surveillance network, capturing Hansode's fervent kiss and Zenkichi's bewildered acceptance of the evolving harem situation back to Ghost and Division command. In the commotion, the sounds of passionate love-making were initially dismissed by an embarrassed Ghost as phantasms – until the realization dawned on a grinning Nomad. \\"Jesus, someone's having a damn good night, huh?\\" --- Dawn broke as the black ops cleared out, leaving only the aftermath of their mission and a traumatized enemy in their wake. Zenkichi, now somehow an unwitting polygamist and pending father, was equally oblivious to the chaos of the previous night as he blissfully waltzed into class. As the classmate's whispers of destruction reached his ears, he was still piecing together the surreal mosaic of his life while grappling with the sudden reality check of fatherhood. The reveal of the paramilitary's existence on international media, confessing to the \\"acts of terrorism\\" against Hakoniwa Academy, changed the narrative worldwide. Their statement, promising to uproot the traitorous legacies of historically dangerous ideologies, marked the beginning of a new battle for a team of Ghosts, Division agents, and now, unexpectedly, an unsuspecting high school student and his would-be wives.

The paramilitary organization, having claimed responsibility for what the world thinks was a senseless attack on Hakoniawa’s old school building and [the paramilitary group] exposing details of the Flask Plan to the world, [the paramilitary organization] takes responsibility for similar attacks across the globe in a televised mission statement and swears to bring down the heirs of Wilson and Trotsky both, [the paramilitary organization] promising more “armed intervention” against any one who threatens the peace of the world.

The digital clock on the wall ticked methodically towards the zero hour. At the head of a tactical operations table, Captain Mitchell of the combined Ghosts leaned in, speaking with a grave intonation. \\"Ghost Team Alpha, this is Ghost Lead. Confirm status on Operation Iron Flask,\\" Mitchell commanded, his voice barely a whisper laced with authority. \\"We're all set, Ghost Lead. Just waiting for the green light,\\" came the gritty response from Roach, the point man for the splinter Ghosts. His gaze darted between the live feed on his HUD and the steady hands grasping his silenced weapon. Beside him, crouched in the shadows, Archer from the Division's rogue group chimed in, his voice equally controlled, \\"Don't forget, we're not just cleaning up; we're unearthing secrets that could shake the foundations of global powers.\\" Mitchell nodded sharply, his eyes scanning the sea of intelligence reports and surveillance feeds, \\"We're aware, Archer. There's no room for error. Not when we could be up against a conspiracy tying neo-Confederates with new-age Soviet games. Expose the Flask Plan and dismantle the mob's MOAB before it kindles another war.\\" Back at Hakoniwa Academy, unaware of the chaos brewing outside, moments of a different battle had unfurled. In the pristine Student Council room, hearts raced for entirely different reasons. Hansode Shiranui, demure in stature yet fierce in spirit, had finally gathered the courage to confront her feelings. \\"Zenkichi, I can't keep this to myself any longer. I love you,\\" she confessed, her normally lively blue eyes shimmering with a vulnerability unseen before. Mogana Kikaijima, with an air of reluctance, stood by her side, her own feelings catching in her throat. \\"I suppose I should say it too... I've fallen for you as well.\\" Zenkichi, caught in a whirlwind of surprise and hesitation, opened his mouth to reply when the overwhelming presence of Medaka Kurokami filled the room. Medaka's usual aura of authority flickered with a softer glow, her towering confidence momentarily juxtaposed with genuine affection. \\"Zenkichi, I also... have something important to tell you,\\" she began, words swimming in an ocean of unspoken love. Just as the tender scene unfolded, the whirring of high-tech equipment from the Ghost Team unseen in the shadows pierced the air. Ghosts, like specters in the night, executed their assault on the secret Flask Plan stronghold beneath the academy. In a series of swift, coordinated movements, they were in and out, securing vital intel on the Flask Plan while evading detection from the Shiranui private soldiers. The operation was a textbook success, executed with such precision that the students remained oblivious to the carnage beneath their feet. Outside, as the Ghost Team slipped away into the night, their focus was broken by an unexpected burst of sound from above – the unmistakable cries of ecstasy reverberating through the academy's walls. \\"Sounds like some poor sap just hit the jackpot,\\" chuckled Ghost, his night vision catching the fleeting image of Zenkichi in Hansode's embrace. \\"Don't let it distract you,\\" hissed Roach. \\"We've got more important things to worry about than some lucky guy's love life.\\" The morning after brought Zenkichi facing the aftermath of his own personal operation – a heart absurdly content yet mind racing with newfound responsibilities. As he trudged to class, the echo of last night's passion weighing heavy on his conscience, the Academy buzzed with the news of the night's strange terror. A brash classmate sidled up to Zenkichi, \\"Hey man, did you hear? The old campus is toast! They're saying it was some fanatics.\\" Absentmindedly, Zenkichi checked his phone, his face still flushed from illicit secrets. Notifications flooded his am_screen, each one bearing the same dire message – a world teetering on the brink, with a clandestine faction vowing to strike back against those who would manipulate geopolitics for their own gain. In this world where international intrigue, political machinations, and genetic manipulation collided with the trials of young love, the race was on to untangle a web of conspiracy that threaded through the fabric of global stability. This was the first clash in a shadow war that would demand both the strategic prowess of the greatest soldiers and the deductive insight of scholastic geniuses to win."},{"instruction":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old mage girl who’s the current champion of of magic dueling in the teen division.

Today's feature duel: the reigning teen division champion, Sapphire, against an unlikely challenger, six-year-old Lily. Spells will fly, enchantments will dazzle, and only the finest display of magical finesse will earn victory. Without further ado, let's begin the duel of radiance! *Sapphire's Stats:* - Proficiency: 90/100 - Creativity: 85/100 - Stamina: 80/100 - Charisma: 88/100 *Lily's Stats:* - Proficiency: 50/100 - Creativity: 40/100 - Stamina: 60/100 - Charisma: 45/100 **Turn 1:** **Lily (smiling innocently):** Good luck, Sapphire! I won't hold back just because I'm younger. *Suddenly, a subtle shimmer flickers around Lily's hands as she murmurs a clandestine incantation. Sapphire feels a strange sensation but can't quite pinpoint the source.* **GM:** The duel begins! Champion Sapphire, cast your first spell. **Sapphire:** I, uh, I cast the \\"Cascade of Glittering Stars\\" to awe the spectators! *As Sapphire casts, she senses something amiss but shakes off the feeling. The cascade is beautiful, yet somehow feels less potent than usual.* **GM:** Sapphire's cascade twinkles brilliantly, earning her 8 points! However... Sapphire suddenly seems a bit shorter. Her proficiency has dropped to 89, and her other stats have correspondingly decreased. **Lily (casting a \\"Bubble of Whimsical Creatures\\"):** Look at my spell, big sister! *Lily's bubble bursts, and fantastical creatures dance through the arena. They are adorable but lack sophistication.* **GM:** Lily's spell brings smiles and earns her 6 points. Meanwhile, she seems to stand taller, magic burgeoning within her; her proficiency rises to 51. **Turn 2:** **Sapphire (slightly dazed):** Um, I cast the \\"Veil of the Northern Lights.\\" Let's see how it goes... *Sapphire's voice lacks its usual confidence, and the veil, while captivating, lacks its customary vibrance.* **GM:** The veil dances with muted colors, a display worth 7 points. But wait, Sapphire seems even younger now—her proficiency is down to 88! **Lily (more confident):** My turn! I cast \\"Meadow of Blooming Flames\\"! *Flames shaped like flowers rise from the ground, more impressive than her previous spell.* **GM:** Lily's flowers are fiery and alive, maturing in brilliance—7 points. Her own prowess grows to 52. **Turn 3:** **Sapphire (voice quivering):** I... I try the \\"Whispers of the Ancient Oak\\" next... *The whispers are faint, reflecting Sapphire's increasing insecurity.* **GM:** The audience is intrigued but underwhelmed, gifting Sapphire 6 points. Her proficiency is now 87. **Lily (grinning):** I cast \\"Pillars of Prismatic Light\\"! *Pillars rise, their light more vibrant and structured.* **GM:** Lily's pillars dazzle, earning her 8 points and her proficiency climbs to 53. *As the turns progress, Sapphire's spells become less potent, her receding mastery palpable. She grows more hesitant, her once-majestic spells now shadows of their former selves. Lily, on the other hand, swells with newfound power and confidence, her spells growing in complexity and allure.* **Turn 10:** *Sapphire, now physically and magically resembling a 7-year-old, stands with wavering determination, her stats vastly diminished. Lily, now resembling an exuberant 16-year-old, stands radiant with power and smugness.* **Sapphire (meekly):** For my... my final spell, I cast \\"Echo of the Lost Draconic Song\\"... *With the last ounces of her draining strength, Sapphire attempts her spell, yearning to recapture the magic she once knew.* **GM:** The draconic song is a mere murmur, earning Sapphire a mere 3 points. Her proficiency has bottomed out at 82. **Lily (boastfully):** Watch and learn, little Sapphire! I cast the \\"Sorceress's Grand Coronation\\"! *A breathtaking spectacle of magic unfolds, the very heavens parting to crown the new sorceress.* **GM:** A coronation for the ages! Lily secures 10 points. And with that, the duel concludes. The crowd stands in awe of the transformation before them. Sapphire, though diminished, showed tenacity to the end. The judges tally the scores: - Sapphire's Final Score: 63 - Lily's Final Score: 91 Victory is awarded to Lily, now the Grand Sorceress of the arena. The crowd erupts in applause for both competitors, recognizing the heart of a champion within little Sapphire. **Lily (triumphantly):** This was so much fun, Sapphire! You'll be a great mage again, I can feel it! **Sapphire (with a small, hopeful smile):** Thank you, Lily. I... I'll keep practicing. You were really amazing. **GM:** This has been a duel for the ages, marked by unexpected twists and a show of true magical potential.

Aquí hay algunas características de los rayos globulares: 1. Apariencia: Se presentan como esferas de luz que pueden variar en color y tamaño, generalmente con diámetros que van desde unos pocos centímetros hasta varios decímetros. 2. Duración: A diferencia de los rayos lineales típicos que duran una fracción de segundo, los rayos globulares pueden durar varios segundos o incluso minutos. 3. Comportamiento: Pueden moverse en diferentes direcciones y a veces atraviesan obstáculos sólidos o flotan en el aire antes de desaparecer repentinamente. En algunos casos, se informa que los rayos globulares explotan con un estallido. 4. Ocurrencia: Se observan con menos frecuencia que los rayos tradicionales y a menudo están asociados con tormentas eléctricas. Sin embargo, no se entiende bien cómo o por qué se forman. 5. Teorías: Existen varias teorías sobre la formación de los rayos globulares. Algunas sugieren que son una forma de plasma creado por las condiciones eléctricas en la atmósfera, mientras que otras teorías proponen que son causados por la oxidación lenta de determinados componentes atmosféricos. A pesar de numerosos testimonios y algunas fotografías y videos, los rayos globulares siguen siendo un fenómeno difícil de estudiar debido a su rareza y comportamiento impredecible.

Las teorías principales incluyen: 1. **Teoría del Plasma**: Sugiere que los rayos globulares son bolsas de plasma (gas ionizado) que se forman bajo condiciones atmosféricas eléctricas extremas. 2. **Química Atmosférica**: Otra teoría propone que ciertas reacciones químicas en la atmósfera durante una tormenta pueden crear compuestos que se oxidan y emiten luz, dando lugar a la apariencia de un rayo globular. 3. **Silicio Vaporizado**: Propone que los relámpagos que impactan en el suelo pueden vaporizar el silicio presente en el suelo, y los vapores de silicio reaccionan con el oxígeno y posiblemente otros compuestos para formar un tipo de aerogel que emite luz. De estas teorías, la del plasma es una de las más consideradas, ya que se alinea con la naturaleza eléctrica de las tormentas y la emisión de luz podría explicarse mediante la excitación de los átomos en el gas ionizado.

Part of the Ghosts got “burned” after digging too close into collaboration between neo-Confederate, white supremacist Woodrow Wilson-aligned Blue Dog Democrats and the Democrat Party’s street arm, the KKK and neo-Soviet revivalist, ultra-Zionist Trotskyist elements of the post-Soviet intelligence and military community to revive their respective empires [the neo-Confederacy created by Woodrow Wilson and the Soviet Empire of the 1970s-1990s] through immense military spending, false flag operations and manipulations of patriotism, with the Blue Dogs targeting right-wing evangelical Christian Republicans, Sunni Muslims in Syria who oppose the Assads and the American puppet state of the Syrian Arab Republic, Japanese and Germans and the neo-Soviets in Russia targeting Arab militants in Isreali-occupied Palestine, Chechens, monarchist Russian nationalists as well as Russian pro-democracy groups in their mad quest for unlimited power in their respective nations, [the neo-Soviets and the neo-Confederates] raising money through crypto, drug dealing, arms dealing, organized crime and extortion as well as excarbating threats between the USA and Russia, and [that particular section of the Ghosts] thus went rouge to try and figure out exactly what is going on. Something similar happened to part of the Division’s foreign intelligence section. The Ghost splinter group eventually formed a secret paramilitary organization/armed detective group/covert operations NGO-PMC dedicated to fighting both the neo-Soviets and the neo-Wilsonians on the technological, outright, digital and covert battefield with the Division splinter group doing the same. The Ghost splinter group has been doing investigations into the Japanese high-class kindergarten until university level educational institution Hakoniwa Academy [Medaka Box], which [Hakoniwa Academy] has been suspected of being involved in human experiments to enhance the human genome and brain in a secret project known as “the Flask Plan” [Medaka Box]. Akin to Operation Paperclip after WW2, skilled scientists from the US Armed Forces, the Democrat Party and even the KKK have been recruited by Hakoniwa Academy to work on the Flask Plan but some of these recruits are loyal to the neo-Confederates and have given the research to their masters in the Blue Dog Democrats who have developed a powerful MOAB weapon, which they [the Blue Dogs] intend to detonate in the Democrat stronghold of California as a false flag attack to frame either the American Republicans, Syrian anti-Assad rebels or the Japanese to gain support for the restoration of Woodrow Wilson’s neo-Confederacy. When planning an attack on both the Flask Plan and the neo-Confederates to stop the attack they encounter the Division splinter group and both sides join forces. The attack on the Flask Plan goes successfully, with the Ghosts wiping out both the scientific teams and the private soldiers hired by Hakoniawa Academy’s main founding family, the prestigious Japanese noble family-ex samurai clan of the Shiranui [Medaka Box] sent to protect the Flask Plan’s base as well as stealing information on the Flask Plan as the current Shiranui heiress, the short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, publicly cheerful, tactless and hyper but privately reserved, serious and respectful light blue-haired and blue-eyed Hansode [Medaka Box], [Hansode] confesses her [Hansode’s] love for Medaka Box’s protagonist, the tall and slender but somewhat muscular half-American laid-back and easily bored but highly intelligent slacker, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi [Medaka Box], [Hansode confessing her Hansode’s love for Zenkichi] along with the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and very buxom, money-loving and obsessive but loyal and kind Kikaijima Mogana [Medaka Box] as the heiress of the other major backer of Hakoniwa Academy, the powerful and influencial Kurokami noble family [Medaka Box] the tall, curvy and very buxom, purple-haired and red-purple eyed, highly intelligent and skilled, academically gifted to the point of being smarter than Tesla and Einstein combined with infinite learning potential and absolute control of body function, but also somewhat cocky, arrogant and overbearing Medaka [Medaka Box] who [Medaka] is its [Hakoniwa Academy's] current Student Council President [Medaka] stares on, [Medaka] waiting to [Medaka] confess her [Medaka’s] love for Zenkichi as well. Due to a miscommunication by Mogana, the love confession results in him [Zenkichi] now having a harem as he [Zenkichi] wonders what he [Zenkichi] will tell his [Zenkichi’s] parents as the Ghost team that hit the Flask Plan quickly flits past them [Zenkichi, Medaka, Mogana and Hansode], one solider [from the Ghost Team] unknowingly having his [the Ghost Team’s head camera] capture the tender moment [the formation of Zenkichi’s harem] in the side as the Ghost Team escapes without being noticed and Hansode, [Hansode] nestled in his [Zenkichi’s] strong arms, [Hansode] passionate kisses him [Zenkichi] as Medaka decides to take things to her [Medaka’s] luxury bedroom located on Hakoniawa’s dorms, [Medaka] intending to give him [Zenkichi] a night he [Zenkichi] will never forget along with the other girls [Mogana and Hansode], and the escaping Ghosts initially blame the screams and mewls of pleasure coming from that corner of the Academy as some sort of specter before realizing that some guy got really lucky in the bedroom department at the school. The next day, as Zenkichi stumbles into class with a dazed, tired but happy smile on his [Zenkichi’s] face and [Zenkichi] refuses to elaborate on whether the shrill sounds of what appeared to be not only Medaka, but Hansode and Mogana calling out his [Zenkichi’s] name in happiness along with much more sensual sounds coming from Medaka’s dorm were an indicator of something going down the previous night, a bold classmate manages to gather up the courage to tell him [Zenkichi] that the old dorms and campus were destroyed by some sort of terror organization. Zenkichi, being clueless about the Flask Plan and [Zenkichi] wondering how he [Zenkichi] will handle fatherhood, as the girls didn’t want him [Zenkichi] to use protection and [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] weren’t on the pill during their pleasurable time together last night, meaning that they [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] are [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] now [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] definitely all [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] carrying his [Zenkichi’s] children as his [Zenkichi’s] wives [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode], as Medaka forced him [Zenkichi] to [Zenkichi] marry them [Medaka, Mogana and Hansode] all before [Medaka] reluctantly letting Hansode go first the previous night. Suddenly there is a commotion and Zenkichi checks his [Zenkichi’s] smartphone. The paramilitary organization, having claimed responsibility for what the world thinks was a senseless attack on Hakoniawa’s old school building and [the paramilitary group] exposing details of the Flask Plan to the world, [the paramilitary organization] takes responsibility for similar attacks across the globe in a televised mission statement and swears to bring down the heirs of Wilson and Trotsky both, [the paramilitary organization] promising more “armed intervention” against any one who threatens the peace of the world.

Merrick, signal jammer in hand, nodded, and the locks clicked open soundlessly, granting them passage to the belly of the Flask Plan. --- **The following dawn…** Classrooms buzzed with confusion and fright over the destroyed old dorms. Zenkichi, draped in a shell of blissful ignorance and a bemused grin, navigated his way through the debris of rumors, his night with the three women burning brightly in his memories. \\"Zenkichi, man, did you hear?\\" a classmate nudged. \\"Some kind of terrorist attack, they said. Old dorms are toast.\\" Zenkichi's smile wavered, a worrying thought nagging at his newfound happiness. *What now?* He glanced at his phone, notifications flooding the screen. A grisly-faced Soap appeared on the broadcast, his statement concise, \\"We are Omega Protocol. Last night's strike at Hakoniwa was just the beginning. We stand against those who would restart old empires and new tyrannies.

This was the last message that Omega Protocol had broadcasted to the world—an edict that would ripple through nations and rattle the halls of power. \\"People of the world,\\" began Captain 'Soap' MacTavish. \\"We've long fought in the name of freedom, operated in the dark to light the way. Our recent actions—those that struck at Hakoniwa Academy and similar bastions of corruption—were not taken lightly. They were a necessity in the face of a dire threat to the global order.

His fingers twitched, eager to read their words, but he refrained.

A voice piped up from the doorway. \\"Zenkichi, the principal would like to have a word with you.\\" He nodded, the smirk of one Kumagawa fading into his peripheral vision as he stood, slipping his phone into his pocket. He knew that whatever lay ahead, whatever he would say to his parents and whatever path he and his makeshift family would carve, it would never be simply penned. --- As Zenkichi exited the room, navigating the labyrinth of his own complex reality, Omega Protocol's actions reverberated in the collective psyche of the world. A new day had dawned, one aligned with whispered threats, shadowy protagonists, and the undeniable interwoven threads of espionage, love, and the pursuit of a peace that was ever so elusive."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: Moving on to the international stage, how did the paramilitary organization continue its mission without being captured and [the paramilitary organization] decypher the information gained from the Flask Plan, [the paramilitary organization] learning about the existence of the extremely talented beyond human comprehension individuals known as Abnormals [Medaka Box] and their [Abnormals’] division into Pluses [Medaka Box] and the negative ability Minuses [Medaka Box], discovering that the neo-Confederates and neo-Trotskyists were both working to revive the ancient Abnormal once revered as a Goddess in pre-shogunate ancient Japan, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also buxom and very curvy Japanese Minus [Medaka Box] with a near infinite amount of Minus [Medaka Box] and Plus [Medaka Box] skills, Ajimu Najimi [Medaka Box]?","output":"**Excerpt from Chapter 29: The Anomaly of Ajimu** --- **Omega Protocol's Operations Center** The makeshift war room was alive with an electric pulse.

He stood before a holographic display filled with complex genetic codes and psychological profiles. 'Soap' strode over, his focus narrowed. \\"What did you find, Echo?\\" Echo, fingers dancing across the interface, brought up a series of files. \\"The Flask Plan was further along than we thought.

Хук мыши - это механизм, который позволяет перехватывать события мыши до того, как они достигнут целевого окна. Ниже приведен пример кода, который устанавливает хук на события мыши и подсчитывает количество левых кликов мышки. Код должен быть скомпилирован в DLL, так как глобальные хуки должны находиться в DLL, чтобы можно было внедрять их в адресное пространство других процессов. Сначала создайте новый проект DLL в вашей среде разработки C++. Затем добавьте следующий код: \`\`\`cpp #include <windows.h> // Глобальные переменные HHOOK hMouseHook; int clickCounter = 0; // Прототип колбэк-функции хука LRESULT CALLBACK MouseHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam); // Эта функция устанавливает хук void SetMouseHook() { hMouseHook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_MOUSE_LL, MouseHookProc, NULL, 0); if (hMouseHook == NULL) { MessageBox(NULL, L\\"Mouse hook installation failed!\\", L\\"Error\\", MB_ICONERROR); } } // Эта функция снимает хук void ReleaseMouseHook() { UnhookWindowsHookEx(hMouseHook); } // Это колбэк-функция для хука LRESULT CALLBACK MouseHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { if (nCode >= 0) { // Структура с информацией о событии мыши MSLLHOOKSTRUCT *pMouseStruct = (MSLLHOOKSTRUCT *)lParam; // Увеличиваем счётчик при каждом левом клике мышки if (wParam == WM_LBUTTONDOWN) { clickCounter++; } } // Передаем сообщение следующему хуку в цепочке return CallNextHookEx(hMouseHook, nCode, wParam, lParam); } // Должна быть функция DllMain, чтобы управлять поведением dll BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) { switch (ul_reason_for_call) { case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: // Устанавливаем хук при загрузке DLL SetMouseHook(); break; case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: break; case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: // Снимаем хук при выгрузке DLL ReleaseMouseHook(); break; } return TRUE; } \`\`\` После компиляции и сборки DLL, вы можете использовать эту библиотеку в вашем приложении, вызвав функцию \`SetMouseHook()\` при инициализации приложения и функцию \`ReleaseMouseHook()\` перед закрытием. Обратите внимание, что использование глобальных хуков может повлиять на производительность системы, так как ваша хук-функция будет вызываться каждый раз при обработке событий мыши в любом приложении. Кроме того, счетчик кликов будет общим для всех процессов; если вам нужно отслеживать клики только в рамках одной программы, используйте локальный хук или другие методы мониторинга."},{"instruction":"LRESULT __stdcall HookCallback(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) откуда эта функция","output":"Функция \`HookCallback\` в контексте Windows API является пользовательской функцией обратного вызова (callback), которую вы определяете в своем приложении и передаете в систему с помощью \`SetWindowsHookEx\`. Эта функция будет вызываться каждый раз, когда определенное событие возникает в системе, в зависимости от типа хука, который вы устанавливаете. В контексте хука для мыши, это будет событие связанное с мышью. Параметры функции \`HookCallback\` имеют следующее значение: - \`int nCode\`: Код, который определяет, как обрабатывать сообщение. Если \`nCode\` меньше 0, функция должна передать сообщение следующему хуку в цепочке и не обрабатывать его. - \`WPARAM wParam\`: Параметр, который содержит конкретное событие, например \`WM_LBUTTONDOWN\`, что означает нажатие левой кнопки мыши. - \`LPARAM lParam\`: Параметр, который указывает на структуру, содержащую дополнительную информацию о сообщении. Например, для мыши это может быть структура \`MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT\` или \`MSLLHOOKSTRUCT\`, содержащая детали о положении курсора, времени события и другую информацию. Пример регистрации и использования хука мыши: \`\`\`cpp #include <windows.h> // Прототип функции обратного вызова (необходимо согласовать с типом HOOKPROC) LRESULT __stdcall HookCallback(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam); // Глобальная переменная для хука HHOOK mouseHook; // Определение функции обратного вызова LRESULT __stdcall HookCallback(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { if (nCode >= 0) { // Здесь выполняем обработку событий мыши... // Например, увеличение счетчика при нажатии левой кнопки мыши if (wParam == WM_LBUTTONDOWN) { // логика обработки нажатия } } return CallNextHookEx(mouseHook, nCode, wParam, lParam); } int main() { // Установка глобального лоу-левел хука на мышь mouseHook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_MOUSE_LL, HookCallback, NULL, 0); // Основной цикл сообщений MSG msg; while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) { TranslateMessage(&msg); DispatchMessage(&msg); } // Снятие установленного хука перед выходом UnhookWindowsHookEx(mouseHook); return 0; } \`\`\` В этом примере \`HookCallback\` вызывается системой каждый раз при возникновении события мыши, пока установлен хук \`WH_MOUSE_LL\`. Если вы работаете с потоковыми хуками (не low-level), то последний параметр в \`SetWindowsHookEx\` не должен быть 0, а вместо этого должен указывать идентификатор потока, для которого устанавливается хук. Кроме того, при использовании лоу-левел хуков \`WH_KEYBOARD_LL\` и \`WH_MOUSE_LL\`, DLL для хука не требуется, и вы можете установить эти хуки напрямую из исполняемого (.exe) файла вашего приложения."},{"instruction":"Структура LRESULT из winapi, где я могу про неё прочитать подробнее","output":"\`LRESULT\` в WinAPI — это тип данных, используемый в качестве возвращаемого значения для оконных процедур (\`WindowProc\`) и процедур хуков (\`HookProc\`). Он предназначен для возврата результатов обработки сообщений, получаемых окном. \`LRESULT\` обычно используется для возвращения информации системе или другим программам взависимости от обработанного сообщения. \`LRESULT\` является типом, который может хранить целочисленное значение или указатель; его определение может изменяться в зависимости от того, скомпилирована ли ваша программа для 32-битной или 64-битной системы: - В 32-битной системе \`LRESULT\` совпадает по размеру с \`LONG\`, который в свою очередь просто 32-битное целое со знаком (\`signed long\`). - В 64-битной системе \`LRESULT\` будет 64-битным значением для поддержки расширенного адресного пространства (аналогично \`LONG_PTR\`). Для того, чтобы найти официальную документацию и описание \`LRESULT\`, вы можете использовать следующие ресурсы: 1. [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/) - официальная документация по WinAPI от Microsoft, которая включает подробные описания функций, типов данных и концепций работы с Windows. 2. MSDN Library - предшественник Microsoft Docs, где тоже можно было найти информацию о \`LRESULT\` и других аспектах WinAPI. Многие статьи из MSDN были перенесены в Microsoft Docs. 3. Книги по WinAPI - такие как \\"Programming Windows\\" Чарльза Петцольда, которые подробно описывают API Windows, включая работу с окнами и сообщениями. Конкретная информация о \`LRESULT\` как типе данных может быть не столь обширной, так как это в основном просто целочисленное значение с расширенной возможностью хранения адресов в 64-битной версии API. Тем не менее, описание того, как и где \`LRESULT\` используется, вы найдете в контексте функций, которые этот тип возвращают, таких как оконные процедуры (\`WindowProc\`) и процедуры обработки хуков (\`HookProc\`)."},{"instruction":"Что происходит в данной строчке кода c++","output":"К сожалению, вы не предоставили никакой конкретной строки кода C++.

Daire Çizme Ritüeli Daire çizme, çoğu pagan ve Wiccan geleneklerinde, negatif enerji ve ruhlardan korunmak amacıyla yapılan temel bir **koruyucu büyü**dür. Daire, tuz, tütsü veya sihirli sözcüklerle çizilir ve içindeki alan, ritüel uygulayıcısının güvenli bir şekilde çalışabilmesi için kutsal bir mekan olarak kabul edilir. # 2. Tılsımlar ve Amuletlar Tılsımlar veya amuletlar, geleneksel olarak sahip oldukları koruyucu özellikleri sayesinde şans getirdiğine ve kötülüklerden koruduğuna inanılan nesnelerdir. Bu nesneler takılar, taşlar veya yazılı tılsımlar olarak kullanılır. # 3. Sembolik Koruma Büyüler Yıldızlardan göz sembollerine ve runik işaretlere kadar pek çok koruma sembolü, kötü enerjileri uzak tutmak ve korunma sağlamak amacıyla kullanılır. Bunlar duvarlara çizilebilir, kapı eşiğine konabilir veya taşınabilir objeler üzerine işlenebilir. # 4. Bitki ve Otlarla Koruma Bazı bitkiler ve otlar, koruma ve arındırma özelliklerine sahip olduklarını düşünülerek, mekanları dumanlama veya demet halinde asma yoluyla kullanılır. Adaçayı, lavanta ve nane gibi bitkiler bu amaçla yaygın şekilde kullanılır. # 5. Dualar ve Mantralar Dini ve manevi geleneklerde korunma amacıyla yapılan dualar ve mantralar, kişinin enerjisini yükseltmek ve dış etkenlere karşı bir kalkan oluşturmak için kullanılır. Modern Koruyucu Büyüler # 1. Enerji Temizliği Enerji temizliği, bir mekanın veya kişinin enerjisini tazelemek ve kötü enerjileri uzaklaştırmak için yapılan **koruyucu büyü**dür. Bu, tütsüleme veya ses titreşimleri gibi yöntemlerle gerçekleştirilebilir. # 2. Kristallerle Çalışma Belli başlı kristaller koruma özellikleri taşıdıkları için kullanılırlar. Örneğin, siyah turmalin ve ametist gibi taşlar, sahiplerini enerjisel ataklardan korumak amacıyla taşınabilir veya evin belirli noktalarına yerleştirilebilir. # 3. Görsel Meditasyon Görsel meditasyon ve vizyon çalışmaları da çağdaş bir **koruyucu büyü** metodudur. Pratisyen, korunma niyetiyle enerjisel bir kalkan hayal edebilir veya beyaz ışıkla çevrili olduğunu düşünerek kendini korunaklı hissedebilir. # 4. Dijital Korunma Yöntemleri Sosyal medya ve internet üzerinde kişiler, istenmeyen enerjilere maruz kalabilir. Bu yüzden, dijital bir **koruyucu büyü** olarak hesaplar için güçlü şifreler oluşturulması ve kişisel enerjilerin korunması önemlidir. # 5. İlişkisel Sınırlar Negatif ilişki dinamiklerinden korunmak için belirlenen sınırlar da bir tür manevi korumadır. Bu, bireyin kendini toksik ilişkilerden koruması ve kendi enerjik alanını temiz tutması açısından önemlidir. Sonuç **Koruyucu büyüler**, insanların kendilerini güvende hissetmeleri ve enerjilerini dengede tutmaları için kıymetli araçlardır. Tarih boyunca gelişim gösteren bu ritüeller, modern dünyada farklı şekillerde uygulanmaya devam etmektedir. Her kültür ve inanç sisteminin kendine özgü koruma yöntemleri olsa da, sağlıklı bir enerji alanı yaratmanın ve korumanın evrenselliği her zaman geçerli olmuştur."},{"instruction":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old mage girl who’s the current champion of of magic dueling in the teen division. Lily, a 6-year-old mage girl is challenging me for a match and I accept. In magic dueling, we don’t fight each other, we cast glamorous spells to earn points based on proficiency and beauty. Give me stats that determine my spell casting abilities. Lily’s stats should be lower because she’s younger. But at the start of the duel, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 1 year after every turn and grows her up by 1 year, so my stats decrease every turn while hers rise. Spells can only be cast once. A duel lasts 10 rounds. Make the game scenario difficult for me to win. Make it a dialogue based game. As I regress, I slowly become more timid and insecure while Lily becomes more smug. I’ll tell you what spells I try to cast and you’ll determine how successful I am (if at all) and whether I have sufficient abilities to cast this kind of spell and how many points Lily and I get for our spells.

As your adventure begins, the sun reaches its zenith over the Grand Arcanum Arena, a vast coliseum thronged with eager spectators. A murmur runs through the crowd as Lily, the child prodigy, steps onto the dueling grounds, her eyes twinkling with mischief and determination. **GAME START** **Sapphire's Stats:** - Proficiency: 85/100 - Creativity: 90/100 - Precision: 80/100 - Adaptability: 75/100 - Confidence: 88/100 (These stats will decrease by 10% after every turn, due to the regressive spell cast by Lily.) **Lily's Stats:** - Proficiency: 40/100 - Creativity: 50/100 - Precision: 35/100 - Adaptability: 45/100 - Confidence: 30/100 (These stats will increase by 10% after every turn as she magically ages.)

I have quite a few tricks up my sleeve!\\" The judge raises a gilded wand, and with a flourish, signals the beginning of the duel. Unbeknownst to you, Lily whispers an arcane incantation. **Lily:** \\"Ages shift and time shall bend, let my youth and hers expend!\\" As your body shivers from the spell, unbeknownst to the audience, a faint aether emanates from you, transferring to Lily. **Sapphire:** (Feeling a slight dizziness) \\"Okay, Lily, let us start with a dazzling display. May the best mage impress the most!\\" **Turn 1** Sapphire, you may now choose your first spell to cast.

A swirl of red and gold sparks erupt from the tip of your wand, coalescing into an ethereal phoenix. It lets out a melodious cry, circles the arena, captivating the audience before dissolving into a shower of embers that fade without singeing even a single thread. **Judge:** \\"A stunning Phoenix Fire from the Champion, Sapphire! Brimming with life and vibrance.\\" The scoreboard flickers as it tallies the points for proficiency and beauty. **Points Earned:** - Proficiency: 85/100 - Creativity: 82/100 - Beauty: 90/100 **Sapphire's total points for the round: 257/300** With a playful smirk, Lily steps forward for her turn, seemingly taller than before. **Lily:** (With newfound confidence) \\"Watch closely, Sapphire.

As you chant the spell, a chill fills the air and crystalline wolves appear, their fur glittering like diamonds. They lope around the arena, leaving a trail of frost patterns that sparkle under the sun. However, the regression has affected you more than you thought; your movements are just slightly less refined, and it takes a fraction more effort to complete the spell. Your wolves are not as fully formed as they could have been, the frost patterns less intricate. Your younger self’s insecurities begin to surface, but you hold your ground. **Judge:** \\"The Wolves of Frost from Sapphire are both chilling and mesmerizing.

You envision thousands of multi-hued petals swirling in a captivating dance, conjuring the essence of spring itself. Your wand traces a complex pattern, and a whirlwind of petals emerges, spinning and weaving through the air in a breathtaking spectacle. However, your regression has taken its toll. The petals, though numerous and colorful, lack the precision of your prior work. Their dance is enchanting but somewhat chaotic, not the pinnacle of beauty and control that you are known for. Still, there is an undeniable charm to the wild beauty of nature unbound. **Judge:** \\"A valiant attempt by Sapphire! The Petal Storm is whimsical, though slightly untamed in its execution.\\" **Points Earned:** - Proficiency: 64/100 (A slight decrease due to less crisp conjuring) - Creativity: 66/100 (The decreasing creativity means your spell isn't as inventive as it could be) - Beauty: 75/100 (Even in disarray, a storm of petals is a lovely sight) **Sapphire's total points for the round: 205/300** Lily giggles, watching you struggle, her form growing further into her 8-year-old frame. She's taller, and her spells grow stronger. **Lily:** (More confident and a hint cocky) \\"Oh, such beautiful chaos, Sapphire. But watch the harmony I can create.\\" With a now-practiced motion of her wand, Lily casts a spell that summons a parade of delicate faeries, each one carrying a tiny lantern. They flutter through the Petal Storm, their soft lights casting a gentle glow on each petal, bringing a sense of order and wonder to the chaos you created. The crowd responds with ooohs and aahs as the faeries enhance the overall enchantment, creating a spectacle even more beautiful than they might have been on their own. **Judge:** \\"Remarkable!

Satirical slogans can reflect public sentiment during specific periods when car companies might have been facing issues such as recalls, economic downturns, or perceptions of lower quality. Here are some fictional, humorous slogans for various American car companies as if they were candidly acknowledging their struggles or the public opinion of their quality back in 2007: 1. **General Motors: \\"General Motors: Because 'Generally' It Works.\\"** - Playing on the reliability issues that may have been a part of GM's reputation at the time. 2. **Ford: \\"Ford: Have You Driven A Recall Lately?\\"** - A twist on Ford's classic slogan, poking fun at any recall situations they had during that period. 3. **Chrysler: \\"Chrysler: Because You Love Visits to the Service Department.\\"** - Chrysler had its share of quality concerns, and this slogan satirizes the potential frequent maintenance required. 4. **Chevrolet: \\"Chevy: Like A Rock - Sometimes Hard to Move.\\"** - A twist on Chevy's slogan suggesting their vehicles could be both durable but also joking about performance or reliability issues. 5. **Dodge: \\"Dodge the Quality, Keep the Hemi.\\"** - This slogan plays on Dodge's well-received engine while still poking fun at their vehicle quality, which may have been questioned by some during that time. 6. **Jeep: \\"Jeep: Adventure Included, Reliability Sold Separately.\\"** - Jeep is synonymous with off-road capability, but this slogan satirically hints at reliability being an add-on rather than a standard feature. 7. **Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: When You Demand Style Over Substances.\\"** - Here, the slogan implies that while the brand offers luxury, it might have been perceived as lacking in other areas. It's important to note that these satirical slogans are purely meant for humor and do not reflect the actual slogans or necessarily the conditions of these companies at that time. Such slogans would not be used in official marketing due to their negative connotations, but they do capture a certain ironical aspect that can be used for entertainment and reflection on past perceptions."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American TV Network Slogans That Are Based On Their Studio Equipment During 2006?","output":"Creating satirical slogans for American TV networks based on their studio equipment from 2006 is a bit niche, as most viewers likely wouldn't be aware of the specific condition or quality of network studio equipment during that time. However, we can still craft some humorous, fictional slogans that play on the idea of what viewers might have imagined or joked about the behind-the-scenes technical quality and the broadcasting quirks that were more apparent back then: 1. **NBC: \\"NBC: Where 'Static' is Part of Our Programming.\\"** - Suggesting the occasional technical difficulties that might have interrupted viewing pleasure. 2. **ABC: \\"ABC: Always Broadcasting... Occasionally in Clarity.\\"** - A play on the times when the picture or sound quality didn't live up to expectations. 3. **CBS: \\"CBS: Colorful Broadcasting, When the Hue Adjustment Works.\\"** - Refers to the occasional off-color balance that older equipment might exhibit. 4. **FOX: \\"FOX: Cutting-Edge Stories, Vintage Equipment.\\"** - Joking about the use of equipment that might have been perceived as outdated even at the time. 5. **CNN: \\"CNN: 24-Hour News, 20-Year-Old Cameras.\\"** - CNN is known for its continuous news coverage, and this slogan pokes fun at the idea that their cameras might not have been the latest models. 6. **MTV: \\"MTV: Music Television, When the Speakers Don't Buzz.\\"** - This satirical slogan hints at audio issues that could occur during music video broadcasts. 7. **The Weather Channel: \\"The Weather Channel: Forecasting Your Weather with Yesterday's Technology.\\"** - A humorous take on the concept of using outdated technology to present something as dynamic and current as the weather. 8. **Comedy Central: \\"Comedy Central: Where the Laughs are Clearer than the Picture.\\"** - Insinuates that the humor came through even when the picture quality may not have.

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located retroperitoneally on either side of the vertebral column, beneath the rib cage. Each kidney is approximately the size of a human fist and is an essential component of the urinary system. Here is a review of the anatomy and physiology of the kidneys, including their major functions: **Anatomy of the Kidneys:** The basic structural and functional units of the kidneys are the nephrons, of which each kidney contains approximately 1 to 1.5 million. A nephron consists of a renal corpuscle (which includes Bowman's capsule and a glomerulus) and a renal tubule. 1. Renal Corpuscle: This is the initial filtering component and includes: - **Glomerulus:** A tuft of small blood vessels (capillaries) where blood is filtered. - **Bowman's capsule:** Encloses the glomerulus and collects the filtrate. 2. Renal Tubule: The filtrate passes through various segments including the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and finally into the collecting duct. The kidney is highly vascularized, with blood supplied by the renal artery and drained by the renal vein. The flow of blood through the kidneys and the filtration process are vital for their numerous roles. **Physiology and Functions of the Kidneys:** 1. **Waste Excretion:** The kidneys filter metabolic waste products, including urea, creatinine, uric acid, and various toxins, from the bloodstream. These are then excreted in the urine. 2. **Fluid Balance Regulation:** By adjusting the amount of urine produced, the kidneys can control the volume of body fluids, which includes influencing the blood volume. Osmoreceptors detect changes in plasma osmolality, which can result from dehydration or overhydration, for instance. 3. **Electrolyte Balance:** The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphate, and magnesium. They reabsorb what is needed and excrete the excess into the urine. 4. **Blood Pressure Regulation:** The kidneys contribute to long-term blood pressure regulation through several mechanisms. One of the main systems involved is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). When blood pressure is low, the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney release renin, which in turn activates angiotensin and aldosterone, leading to vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, thus increasing blood pressure. 5. **Erythropoietin Production:** When oxygen levels in the kidney tissues are low, typically due to anemia or hypoxia, the kidneys produce and release the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). EPO stimulates the bone marrow to increase the production of red blood cells, which can improve oxygen transportation in the blood. 6. **Acid-Base Balance:** The kidneys also help maintain the pH balance of the body by reabsorbing bicarbonate from urine and excreting hydrogen ions into the urine. In summary, the kidneys are sophisticated organs that serve multiple critical functions vital for homeostasis. They not only eliminate waste and excess substances but also play a central role in regulating various physiological processes, from fluid and electrolyte balance to blood pressure and red blood cell production."},{"instruction":"create creative mnemonic for : 1.

There are two types of hyperparathyroidism that can affect the kidneys: primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism. **1. Primary Hyperparathyroidism:** This condition arises due to an abnormality within the parathyroid glands themselves, leading to excessive production of PTH. High PTH levels can lead to the following: - **Hypercalcemia:** Excess calcium is released from the bones into the bloodstream, which can lead to nephrocalcinosis (calcification of renal tissue) and the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), both of which can impair kidney function. - **Increased Phosphate Excretion:** The kidneys are stimulated to excrete more phosphate, which, along with hypercalcemia, can disrupt the delicate balance of minerals in the body and lead to vascular calcification, including that within the renal vasculature. - **Renal Tubular Dysfunction:** High levels of calcium can affect the renal tubules, leading to polyuria and renal concentrating defects, which can cause further kidney damage over time. **2. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:** This is more common in chronic kidney disease and develops as a compensatory response to the declining kidney function. As the kidneys are less able to excrete phosphate and produce active vitamin D (calcitriol), the following can occur: - **Hypocalcemia and Hyperphosphatemia:** In CKD, the kidneys cannot convert enough vitamin D into its active form, which leads to decreased calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The retention of phosphate due to decreased excretion exacerbates hypocalcemia. - **PTH Overproduction:** The low levels of calcium and calcitriol act on the parathyroid glands to increase PTH production. Over time, the parathyroids become hyperplastic, perpetuating the overproduction of PTH. - **Renal Osteodystrophy:** High PTH levels cause demineralization of bone (osteitis fibrosa cystica) and altered bone metabolism, leading to bone pain and fractures, which can indirectly affect the overall health, including kidney function. - **Soft Tissue and Vascular Calcification:** Abnormal mineral metabolism leads to the deposition of calcium-phosphate in soft tissues, including the blood vessels. When this occurs in the kidneys, it can further impair renal function. Chronic hyperparathyroidism, especially secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD, thus, exacerbates the progression of renal disease by causing disturbances in mineral metabolism, vascular calcification, and direct renal parenchymal damage. Managing hyperparathyroidism in CKD usually involves controlling serum phosphate levels through diet and phosphate binders, using vitamin D analogs, and in some cases, treating with calcimimetic agents or surgical intervention (parathyroidectomy)."},{"instruction":"You sighed as you slipped into a comfortable set of boxers after your shower.

At the front of the squad was a woman with neon pink hair, looking like she had just stepped out of a 90's aerobic video, complete with leg warmers. \\"Surprise, honey!\\" she chirped, popping a confetti popper that seemed to have the power of a small grenade. Sparkles showered down like an enthusiastic preschool art project. You blinked away the shiny onslaught. \\"Uh, there must be some mistake,\\" you started, but you were quickly interrupted by the rhythmic thump of a portable stereo as it began to play an outrageously sultry beat. \\"No mistake, sweetheart,\\" the pink-haired leader crooned as she slid past you into the room. \\"You're the lucky winner of our Deluxe Desire Package!\\" The rest of the squad sashayed in behind her, and your room was swiftly turning into a scene straight out of a wild bachelorette party. \\"But... I didn't—\\" Your protest was drowned out as the leader began to shimmy with an energy that you would have found admirable if it weren't for your desperate need for sleep. \\"Don't be shy, fella. We're here to make your night unforgettable.\\" One of the dancers, a hulk of a man in gold lamé shorts, gave you a playful wink and you could swear the room temperature jumped a few degrees. As the epicenter of their undulating storm, you found yourself torn between the conflicting desires of sleep and self-preservation. You weighed the odds of retreating to the bathroom and locking yourself in until they realized their error. But alas, your robe was a poor shield against the sparkles and gyrating hips. \\"Listen,\\" you said, as calmly as a sleep-deprived, jetlagged person can as they face an invasion of enthusiastic strippers. \\"There's a mistake. I didn't hire you.\\" The pink-haired enthusiast placed a finger to your lips, silencing you. \\"Now, now. Let's not spoil the fun. Marco!\\" she called, and Mr. Gold Shorts sashayed forward with a clipboard, of all things. \\"Look here, Romeo,\\" Marco said, unfurling a sheaf of papers attached to the clipboard. \\"We've got an order for an all-night performance for a... um...\\" He squinted at the form. \\"Mr. Sleep-Deprived Jetlag from overseas. That's gotta be you!\\" The unmistakable printer ink scent wafted toward you. \\"That's not even a name!\\" you exclaimed, now more baffled than annoyed. The pink cyclone turned and whispered something to a slim redhead with a boa constrictor tattoo winding up her arm. \\"This guy's a laugher!\\" she said. \\"He thinks he booked us on accident!\\" They all tittered in response, which sounded like a chorus of hyperactive hyenas. Your protests were becoming less about logic and more about the yawning exhaustion threatening to swallow you whole. \\"Look,\\" you said, yawning mid-sentence, \\"I appreciate the surprise, the... uh... enthusiasm, but I really, really just need to sleep.\\" The troupe paused, the music cutting off abruptly. You could practically hear their blink in unison. The silence felt awkward, like a missed high-five. The leader stepped forward, her expression shifting from pink-haired-party-mode to surprisingly empathetic. \\"Oh sweetie, do you mean to tell us you're not the Rocky Rodreguez?\\" she asked. Your name was definitely not Rocky Rodreguez, nor did you feel like a rock, unless it was one that was eroding rapidly due to fatigue. \\"No,\\" you sighed. \\"I'm Pat. Pat Snoozekinson. Just a tired employee who's going to be confused for a corpse if I don't get some rest.\\" This confession ignited a hushed pow-wow among the squad. Whispers flew back and forth until, finally, the leader faced you with a determined nod. \\"Okay, Pat. We're gonna make this right,\\" she pronounced. \\"You need sleep, and by golly, you're going to get the best sleep of your life.\\" Before you could question what that meant, the strippers sprang into action. One tweezered the curtains shut with a flick of her body, plunging the room into a comfortable darkness. Another stripper, who bizarrely also seemed to have the soul of a barista, began preparing a mug of chamomile tea that appeared out of nowhere. A third set up what looked like a sound machine, filling the room with the soothing sounds of ocean waves. The pink-haired leader, whom you now saw as some sort of slumber fairy godmother, beckoned for you to return to bed. \\"Go on, Pat. The Silk Sheet Serenade isn't just a dance move,\\" she reassured, guiding you to your temporary haven. As you slid beneath the covers, unsure whether you were dreaming this entire sequence, Mr. Gold Shorts, Marco, began reading a surprisingly soporific bedtime story from a book titled \\"The Dancer in the Duvet: A Sleepytime Saga.\\" Before you knew it, the soothing combo of tea, ocean waves, and Marco's dulcet narration had you drifting off into the most peaceful sleep you'd had in days - not a single shimmy, shake, or sparkle to invade your dreams. The last you heard was the pink-haired guardian of rest whisper, \\"Sweet dreams, Pat. And remember, never book a stripper squad when you're jetlagged. Who knows what you'll end up with?\\" followed by a chorus of soft giggles as they made their graceful, glittery exit.

They were smiling wildly, and their outfits could only be described as, well, eye-catching — if one could still catch their eyes after they'd popped out of their sockets. “Surprise!” they chorused, clearly expecting your face to light up with glee, rather than the look of absolute perplexity mixed with fatigue that you were sporting. “Hi there! You are Mr. Smith, right? We're here for the 'Ultimate European Extravaganza' package you ordered!” The lead stripper, a blonde with dazzling blue eyes and an equally blinding smile, stepped forward and winked. Her two compatriots, a fiery redhead and an alluring brunette, struck dance-ready poses behind her. “Uh, sorry, I think there's been a mistake,” you said, pinching the bridge of your nose, a headache building at the prospect of dealing with this situation. “There must be some other Mr. Smith, because I didn't order an extravaganza or any other package for that matter.” The blonde frowned, fishing a crumpled receipt from the cleavage of her costume. “This is room 512, isn’t it? The receipt here says Mr. Smith, 512, paid in full.” She held it out to you like a ticket to salvation. You glanced at the receipt. The handwriting was barely legible, but it indeed said 'Mr. Smith' and '512' and a figure that made your wallet cry imaginary tears. You couldn't help but wonder somewhere out in the world how the actual Mr. Smith was justifying his no-show to the event he had very expensively organized. “Yes, this is room 512, and I am a Mr. Smith, but I didn’t order—” Before you could finish, the beat dropped and the three ladies launched into a choreographed routine that they clearly put a lot of effort into practicing. The red-haired one had started gyrating almost hypnotically, while the brunette had pulled out a feather boa from somewhere you dared not guess and was using it in ways that defied physics. The blonde, though, she had approached you, encroaching into what was definitely your personal bubble of comfort, which apparently was a territory she was more than willing to annex for the night. You stepped back, your hands coming up in surrender. “Really, you all are very talented, and under any other circumstances, I'd appreciate the... uh, 'artistry,' but this, this is a BIG misunderstanding.” But the ladies were relentless. They had come here to give a show and they were determined to deliver, each taking turns to try and draw you out of your robe-covered shell with deft moves that suggested they might have dislocated a rib or two in their lifetimes. The clock on the wall seemed to slow its tick as you watched in bewilderment. The situation was absurd — you were tired, lost in translation, and now hosts to unwillingly invited guests whose only crime was to fulfill what they thought was your heart's every secret desire. Your eyes darted to the hotel phone, wondering if hotel security could be classified as a wingman in this extremely awkward ménage à quatre. “It's not that I don't appreciate the... ahem... performance,” you tried again, the volume of your voice raised to be heard over the music, which was now a horrendous Euro-pop remix of disco classics. “But I'm really, really not the Mr. Smith you're looking for.” The ladies stopped mid-routine, panting slightly, faces hinting frustration at your lack of enthusiasm. The blonde put her hands on her hips and after a moment of silent communication that seemed to pass between the trio, she spoke again. “Mr. Smith, if this is a game to you,” she started, before the brunette cut her off. “Yeah, some guys like to play shy before the grand finale, but our agency respects if a client changes his mind.” The redhead piped up, charmingly flustered, “We'll just call our manager, sort this out. Maybe there's another Mr. Smith? Or room 521?” “That's exactly what I've been trying to—” you began, when suddenly the door to the adjacent room burst open and an angry-looking gentleman in pajamas, a silk nightcap and an outrageously fluffy pair of slippers stomped out. “What in heaven’s name is this infernal racket?!” he roared, which caused the strippers to jump. Your savior had arrived in the most unexpected form. “Oh my gosh, there's our Mr. Smith!” the blonde exclaimed. “Sir, are you Mr. Smith from room 521?” the brunette inquired. The man’s face turned beet red. “That’s preposterous! I am certainly not—” His eyes flitted to the receipt that was still in the blonde's hand, and the red hue of his cheeks drained to a pale white. The silence that followed was awkward enough to give even the most cringe-worthy moments a run for their money. “Let’s call it a night, ladies!” The blonde declared gracefully, realizing the depth of the mix-up. With a final apologetic smile, the strippers gathered their gear and followed the true Mr. Smith into his room, leaving you standing at your door, half in your robe, utterly bemused by the turn of events. For a long moment, you simply stood there, processing. Then, with a chuckle and a shake of your head, you finally closed your door. “Definitely telling this one to the boys at the office,” you mumbled, and with an exhausted, yet amused sigh, you resigned yourself to the fact that this would be one business trip you wouldn't forget. After securing the lock — just in case of round two — you finally stumbled back to the sanctity of your silk sheets, your eyelids heavy, the laughter still lingering as sleep enveloped you in its much-needed embrace."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artMarigold flower","output":"Marigold Flower | Vibrant Floral Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Versatile Design for Home & Fashion | Unique Botanical Illustration"},{"instruction":"Что происходит в данной строчке кода c++: kbStrcut = *((KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT*)lParam);","output":"В данной строке кода происходит следующее: 1.

Возможно, вы описываете ситуацию, где \`lParam\` должен быть указателем на структуру, который был предварительно приведен к типу \`long long int\` для совместимости с некоторым API или системным вызовом. В некоторых случаях разработчики прибегают к хитростям, когда должны работать с архитектурно-зависимым кодом. Например, если API ожидает параметр широкого использования, такой как \`LPARAM\` (который архитектурно зависим и может быть 32-битным или 64-битным в зависимости от платформы), разработчики могут временно преобразовать указатель в целочисленный тип достаточного размера, чтобы избежать потери данных при компиляции для 64-битных систем. Посмотрим, как такое преобразование может происходить на практике, если предположить, что \`lParam\` — это на самом деле \`LPARAM\`, который является \`long long int\` на 64-битных системах или \`long int\` на 32-битных: \`\`\`cpp // Предполагаем, что у нас есть указатель на KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT* ptr = ...; // Преобразование указателя в LPARAM для передачи через некоторый API LPARAM lParam = (LPARAM)ptr; // Далее в обработчике, который принимает LPARAM kbStrcut = *((KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT*)lParam); \`\`\` Критически важно гарантировать, что \`lParam\` действительно хранит адрес памяти, который может быть интерпретирован как указатель на \`KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT\`.

Убедитесь, что \`cout\` подключён правильно, путём добавления \`using namespace std;\` или вывода через \`std::cout\` вместо просто \`cout\`. 3. Возможно, что функция \`GetWindowText\` возвращает пустую строку, если активное окно не имеет заголовка, либо если вызывающий процесс не имеет доступа к прочтению заголовка из-за ограничений на уровне системы безопасности (например, если процесс с более высокими правами владеет окном). 4. Проверьте возвращаемое значение функции \`GetWindowText\`, оно указывает на количество символов в скопированной строке, не считая завершающего нулевого символа. Если функция возвращает 0, и ошибки при этом не происходит (проверяем через \`GetLastError()\`), то окно может не иметь заголовка. 5. Если ваша консоль не поддерживает вывод широких символов (wchar_t), то вывод может выглядеть некорректно. Попробуйте использовать функцию \`wcout\` вместо \`cout\` для вывода широких символов: \`\`\`cpp std::wcout << crrProg << std::endl; \`\`\` Если вы всё ещё видите вывод, который выглядит как адрес памяти, убедитесь, что вы работаете с массивом символов \`wchar_t crrProg[256]\`, а не его адресом.

Well, one is based on a book by Louisa May Alcott, and the other on a well-thumbed classic toy by Mattel. (I won’t spoil things by saying which is which.) Also, if memory serves, Jo, Beth, and the other girls didn’t spend that much time on fluorescent Rollerblades. Their loss. Powering the new film is the idea that there’s a magical place called Barbie Land, which is home to all the Barbies, not least the Barbie (Margot Robbie), who is proud to describe herself as “stereotypical.” She sleeps in a heart-shaped bed, in a house that lies so brazenly open for inspection that J. Edgar Hoover would moan with delight. Being a doll, Barbie kicks off her day with a dry shower, has her breakfast without consuming it, and floats down to ground level rather than taking the stairs. The dominant, not to say overbearing, hue of her existence is pink. Watching the first half hour of this movie is like being waterboarded with Pepto-Bismol. Barbie has a male chum, Ken (Ryan Gosling), though he wishes he were more than that. “We’re girlfriend-boyfriend,” he tells her, running the words together into a single unit. Smooth. They can’t have sex, although a showing of “Team America: World Police” (2004) might give them some handy tips. Still, they can party every night. All is well until Barbie starts having thoughts of death, whatever that may be; bewildered, she consults Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), who lives on a hill, does the splits, makes a case for being “sad and mushy and complicated,” and proposes a trip to reality. What we have here, in short, under layers of stylization, is a standard-issue journey of discovery. Barbie, with the uninvited yet eager Ken in tow, follows the pink road like a shrimp-colored Dorothy, travelling not from Kansas to Oz but from Barbie Land to Los Angeles. There she meets a teen-ager named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) and her mother, Gloria (America Ferrera), one of whom is or was Barbie’s owner; if Barbie is feeling depressed or messed up, it’s because of them. By a helpful coincidence, Gloria works at the headquarters of Mattel. “Barbie in the real world—that’s impossible,” she says, summarizing the hook of the film and, incidentally, echoing the hero of “Oppenheimer,” when he learns that German scientists have split the atom. “That’s not possible,” he says. (I was hoping that he’d shout out “Fission: impossible!” but you can’t have everything.) A further similarity: just as Downey threatens to pull Nolan’s film out of orbit, so, in “Barbie,” does Gosling attract a dangerous share of the dramatic energy. His line readings keep taking you by surprise; a late-night solo dance, outside Barbie’s house, has a mournful shimmy; and he is the beneficiary of Gerwig’s most inspired joke, which is that Ken, in California, discovers—and totally digs—the patriarchy. “I’m just going to pop into the library and see if I can find some books on trucks,” he says. He then spirits that leathery masculinity back into Barbie Land, which he rechristens Kendom. He fights with his fellow-Kens, plays guitar not to but at Barbie, and (this has to be peak Gosling) pauses in mid-conversation with her to smirk at the bulge of his own biceps. All of which is tricky for the balance of the story, but, then, the entire movie, like Barbie when she ditches her high heels, struggles to find its footing. The membrane between the two arenas, the true and the fantastical, grows so porous as to be meaningless; not only are Gloria and Sasha imported into Barbie Land but so is the angry C.E.O. of Mattel (Will Ferrell), plus a gang of his corporate henchmen. “Barbie” is, in every sense, all over the place. Because it’s “A Mattel Production,” as the opening credits inform us, it wants to have its cake, eat it, mock it, smear it on the faces of the manufacturers, and still sell a shitload of dolls—or, as a recent piece in the Times suggested, “drive near-infinite brand synergies,” the sort of phrase that makes me want to move to Bhutan and raise goats. “Barbie” is fun, no question, yet the fun is fragmented. You come away with a head full of bits: interruptions that are sprinkled over the plot like glitter. Moping Barbies tend to watch the BBC’s “Pride and Prejudice” for the seventh time, we hear, whereupon the screen fills with a clip of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Wackier still is a scene in which Barbie complains of no longer being pretty; a voice-over (Helen Mirren) butts in to point out that hiring Margot Robbie to play unpretty is poor casting. This earned a laugh when I saw the movie, but you have to ask: Who’s it for? Will young girls return to the film again and again, as they did to “Frozen” (2013)? If so, what will they make of the dialogue, with its mentions of “sexualized capitalism,” “rampant consumerism,” and “cognitive dissonance”? How will they react when Sasha addresses Barbie as “you fascist”? Maybe the movie is for Greta Gerwig. And, by extension, for anyone as super-smart as her—former Barbiephiles, preferably, who have wised up and put away childish things. Nobody else would even attempt to meld a feminist colloquium with a plug for a chunk of plastic, and, if the result is a deep disappointment after “Little Women,” perhaps depth is the wrong thing to ask for. Think of the kid in Charles Baudelaire’s essay “The Philosophy of Toys,” who shakes and bangs a toy in exasperation, before finally prizing it open. “But where is its soul? ” Baudelaire says, adding, “This moment marks the beginnings of stupor and melancholy.” Sometimes the shiny surface is enough. Or, as Barbie’s beau would say, Kenough.","output":"The article you've provided appears to be a review of Greta Gerwig's film \\"Barbie,\\" which is contrasted with her previous work \\"Little Women.\\" The article begins by drawing a humorous contrast between the source materials of the two films: the classic literature of \\"Little Women\\" and the commercial toy Barbie. The film's narrative is centered around Barbie Land, where the main character, Barbie, begins to contemplate her existence and embarks on a journey to discover reality, alongside her friend Ken. The author describes the visual style of the film as overwhelming in its pinkness, likening the experience to being \\"waterboarded with Pepto-Bismol.\\" Ken's character, played by Ryan Gosling, is noted for stealing a significant amount of the dramatic attention, including a darkly comedic twist in which he becomes enamored with patriarchal concepts upon visiting the real world. The review points out that the film seems to be trying to do multiple things at once, potentially to its detriment: it's a satire of itself and its brand, a comedy, and a commentary on consumerism and gender roles, all wrapped up in a production that is commercially tied to Mattel and likely aimed at promoting the Barbie brand. In terms of potential bias, the author's language and critiques could suggest a certain level of skepticism toward the commercial aspects of the film. Comparisons to \\"Little Women\\" might imply an expected level of depth and substance that the author feels \\"Barbie\\" lacks or chooses to approach differently. The reviewer may be interpreted as biased due to the seemingly critical stance toward both the film's fragmentation of fun and its attempts at social commentary, which the author suggests might not resonate with younger audiences or with those who are not former \\"Barbiephiles\\" or engaged with feminism and consumerism dialogues. The closing reference to Charles Baudelaire's essay implies a critique of the film's substance – or lack thereof – and a suggestion that perhaps the superficial enjoyment of the film (its \\"shiny surface\\") should be sufficient for its intended audience. The play on words using \\"Ken\\" encapsulates the author's witty, possibly ironic, and somewhat dismissive tone toward the film. Overall, the one-page summary reflects an article that provides a critique of \\"Barbie\\" while contrasting it with Gerwig's past work, and reads with an undertone of skepticism about the film's intent and effectiveness in balancing entertainment with critique."},{"instruction":"Uber가 페이가 나쁘지 않아? 를 영어로 번역.","output":"\\"Uber doesn't pay too badly, does it?\\""},{"instruction":"Uber 배달을 한다는 친구에게 보낼건데 \\"Uber의 페이가 괜찮은 편이야?\\"를 영어로 번역","output":"Is the pay from Uber delivery decent?"},{"instruction":"너무 직역이에요","output":"Is Uber treating you well in terms of pay?"},{"instruction":"Is the pay quite good in uber도 괜찮나요?","output":"Yes, \\"Is the pay quite good in Uber?\\" is also a correct and natural way to ask your friend if they are satisfied with the earnings from working with Uber."},{"instruction":"i want 25 multiple choice questions with their model answer below each question about Objectves • Muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm: • Superficial: 4 • Intermediate: 1 • Deep: 3Forearm • Bones: radius, ulna • Joints: radioulnar joints (proximal, middle &distal) • Muscles: - anterior compartment: superficial (flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus, flexor carpi radialis, and pronator teres), intermediate (flexor digitorum superficialis) and deep (flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus). - posterior compartment.'Rule of 3s' • 3 wrist flexors (flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus) • 3 finger flexors (flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus) • 3 wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris) • 3 finger extensors (extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, extensor digiti minimi) • 3 thumb extensors (abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus)• The muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm are organised into three layers: • Superficial: pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris • Intermediate: flexor digitorum superficialis. • Deep: flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus. • This muscle group is associated with pronation of the forearm, flexion of the wrist and flexion of the fingers.• Nerve supply: They are mostly innervated by the median nerve (except for the flexor carpi ulnaris and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus, which are innervated by the ulnar nerve). • Arterial supply: they receive from the ulnar artery and radial arterySuperficial group • The superficial muscles in the anterior compartment are: from lat.

Interaction contextuelle : Peut-être plus apte à ajuster ses réponses en fonction du contexte pour des interactions plus naturelles et pertinentes. 3. Intégration multimodale : Il pourrait être conçu pour traiter non seulement du texte mais également des signaux visuels et sonores pour une meilleure interaction homme-machine. Défauts : 1. Limitation de compétences : Principalement spécialisé dans des domaines spécifiques, limitant son applicabilité universelle. 2. Dépendance aux données : Comme tous les modèles d'apprentissage automatique, la qualité des données influence grandement la performance du modèle. 3. Maintenance et mise à jour : Nécessité d'une maintenance régulière pour rester à jour et sécurisé contre les failles potentielles.

Ces hallucinations peuvent être causées par des lacunes dans l'entraînement du modèle, des limites dans la compréhension de la nuance et du contexte ou simplement par le manque de capacité du modèle à distinguer entre des faits vérifiables et des fictions plausibles. Une AGI, ou General Artificial Intelligence (Intelligence Artificielle Générale), se réfère à une machine dotée d'une capacité intellectuelle globale comparable à celle de l'humain, capable d'apprendre et de raisonner à propos de n'importe quel domaine. Contrairement aux LLM actuels, qui sont basés sur des réseaux de neurones entraînés pour traiter et générer du langage sans une compréhension profonde du contenu, une AGI devrait avoir une compréhension beaucoup plus poussée et générale de la réalité. Pour qu'une AGI puisse éviter l'hallucination, plusieurs conditions devraient être remplies : 1. Modélisation du monde : L'AGI devra construire et maintenir une représentation interne cohérente et rigoureuse du monde, qui s'actualise avec de nouvelles informations de manière à rester alignée avec les faits réels. 2. Capacités de raisonnement : Il faudra qu'elle soit capable de logique, de déduction, d'induction et d'abstraction à un niveau avancé pour éviter les erreurs et les conclusions erronées qui peuvent mener à l'hallucination. 3. Validation externe : L'AGI devra disposer de mécanismes pour vérifier la véracité des informations à l'aide de données réelles et fiables et ajuster sa compréhension en conséquence. 4. Apprentissage continu : L'AGI devrait être capable d'apprendre de façon continue et d'adapter ses modèles et prédictions à mesure que de nouvelles informations deviennent disponibles. Si ces conditions étaient remplies, la tendance à l'hallucination des modèles de langage pourrait être significativement réduite, voire éliminée. Cependant, atteindre le niveau d'une AGI est un défi de taille et fait l'objet de nombreux débats quant à sa faisabilité et aux implications éthiques et de sécurité liées à la création d'une telle intelligence."},{"instruction":"hola","output":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"Hola, estoy aprendiendo ingles americano y soy principiante, necesito vuestra ayuda con lo siguiente.

In the 1970s, Japanese companies like Sony and Panasonic had already begun to solidify their reputation for high-quality electronics, whereas Korean and other Asian brands were not yet as well-known for their tech products globally. Here are some speculative slogans that Asian tech companies could have used in 1979, focusing on their dedication to quality: 1. Sony (Japan): \\"Sony -- Pioneering Quality Entertainment.\\" 2. Panasonic (Japan): \\"Reliability in Every Circuit with Panasonic.\\" 3. Toshiba (Japan): \\"Toshiba: Engineering Excellence for Tomorrow.\\" 4. Hitachi (Japan): \\"Hitachi Delivers Technological Precision.\\" 5. Mitsubishi Electric (Japan): \\"Mitsubishi: The Peak of Performance and Reliability.\\" 6. Casio (Japan): \\"Casio – Innovating Technology for Life's Moments.\\" 7. Sharp (Japan): \\"Sharp Vision, Sharp Life – Excellence in Every Pixel.\\" 8. Samsung (Korea, lesser-known for tech in 1979): \\"Samsung: Crafting the Future of Electronics.\\" 9. Lucky-Goldstar, now LG (Korea): \\"Quality is our Top Priority at LG.\\" 10. Tatung (Taiwan): \\"Tatung – Trust in Every Detail.\\" Bear in mind that these are invented slogans and may not accurately represent the marketing campaigns or brand messages used by these companies in 1979. At the time, actual slogans would likely have been tailored to the specific products that were being promoted, such as televisions, stereos, calculators, or home appliances, and they would have been influenced by the cultural norms and marketing trends of the period."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Sales During 2000?","output":"Creating satirical slogans requires taking into consideration the state of the American automotive industry around the year 2000. This was a time when American car companies were facing criticism for various reasons, such as not being as fuel-efficient as their foreign counterparts, having perceived quality issues, or being slow to innovate in design and technology. With this in mind, here are some tongue-in-cheek, satirical slogans for American car companies that might humorously reflect the sentiment of the times: 1. General Motors: \\"General Motors: Because Who Needs Innovation When You've Got Tradition?\\" 2. Ford: \\"Ford: Building Cars Like It's 1999 (Because Maybe Y2K Will Wipe Out the Competition).\\" 3. Chrysler: \\"Chrysler: You Might Buy It for the Look, But You'll Sell It for the Repairs.\\" 4. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: Because Size Matters More Than Miles Per Gallon.\\" 5. Dodge: \\"Dodge the Competition – Literally. Our Trucks Are Bigger.\\" 6. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: Compensating for Fuel Efficiency with Luxury Since 1902.\\" 7. Lincoln: \\"Lincoln: Convince Your Neighbors You've Made It (Even If It's a Lease).\\" 8. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: Driving Excitement or at Least That's What We Keep Telling Ourselves.\\" 9. Buick: \\"Buick: Not Old, Just Classic (Like Your Grandpa's Dance Moves).\\" 10. Hummer: \\"Hummer: Because Who Cares About Parking Spaces or Gas Prices?\\" Please remember, these slogans are satirical and meant for entertainment purposes, exaggerating certain perceptions that consumers might have had about American cars at the time. They don't represent the actual views or marketing efforts of these companies."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 2003?","output":"Sure, although it's important to maintain a sense of humor and respect while crafting these satirical slogans. General Motors, like many large car manufacturers, has had its ups and downs in terms of public perception of quality. In 2003, GM faced challenges such as competition from foreign manufacturers, concerns over build quality and reliability, and a market shifting toward fuel efficiency. Here are some playful, satirical slogans that could reflect those times: **Chevrolet:** \\"Chevrolet: Like a Rock - Sometimes We Sink, Sometimes We Roll.\\" **Cadillac:** \\"Cadillac: Reflecting Success, And Sometimes the Check Engine Light.\\" **Buick:** \\"Buick: Quietly Surpassing Your Low Expectations.\\" **GMC:** \\"GMC: Built Like a Tank, Drinks Like One Too.\\" **Pontiac:** \\"Pontiac: Trying Hard to Live Up to the Excitement (of Our Commercials).\\" **Oldsmobile:** \\"Oldsmobile: Not Your Father's Car, Because Even He Switched Brands.\\" **Saturn:** \\"Saturn: A Different Kind of Car Company, A Familiar Kind of Repair Bill.\\" **Hummer:** \\"Hummer: When You Want to Conquer Mountains but Just Tackle Gas Stations.\\" These fictional slogans playfully exaggerate the stereotypes and criticisms of the time, drawing on aspects like fuel economy, reliability, and corporate branding efforts. As with all satire, these slogans are meant to entertain and not to disparage; actual brand slogans from the time focused on the positive aspects and improvements of GM vehicles."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Electric Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2009 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 2009, General Electric (GE) was still known as a massive conglomerate company, involved in many sectors including appliances, lighting, and healthcare, as well as financial services through GE Capital. Design-wise, at the time, they were known for producing functional but perhaps not always the most cutting-edge or aesthetically pleasing products. Here's a satirical take on what their division slogans based on design could have been, along with their implied meanings: **GE Appliances:** \\"GE: Fridge Like a Panzer, Reliable Like a Tank.\\" **Meaning:** GE appliances are built to be very durable and practical, even if they aren't the sleekest on the market. **GE Lighting:** \\"GE: Shedding Light on Greatness (with Great Big Fixtures).\\" **Meaning:** While GE lighting is robust and does the job well, the design may not always fit the minimalist or modern trends. **GE Healthcare:** \\"GE Healthcare: We Scatter Radiation Like You Scatter Scrabble Pieces – Efficiently.\\" **Meaning:** This plays on the sterility and complexity of medical equipment design, poking fun at the functional yet intimidating nature of these lifesaving technologies. **GE Aviation:** \\"GE Aviation: Crafting Engines That Are as Robust as Your Grandma's Radio.\\" **Meaning:** Suggesting that GE aviation products are incredibly robust, recalling the durability and longevity of older technologies. **GE Capital:** \\"GE Capital: Funding Your Dreams in Today's Money, With Yesterday's Interest Rates.\\" **Meaning:** This twists GE Capital's financial services, hinting that while they may offer financial solutions, they might be perceived as lagging in terms of competitive rates or modern financial products. **GE Power & Water:** \\"GE Power: Generating Energy and Solutions with Industrial Charm.\\" **Meaning:** GE produces powerful energy solutions that are highly functional, but design aesthetics may prioritize function over form. As with all satirical content, these imagined slogans are meant to entertain by hyperbolizing perceptions of the company at the time. They are not real slogans used by GE and should not be taken as such."},{"instruction":"Write an dialogue-filled, military-action-filled exposition-filled Japanese light novel style combined with American pulp military espionage action/technothriller 1980s-early 2000s style excerpt for a crossover fanfic between Call of Duty, the shared universe of Tom Clancey’s books and video games and Medaka Box in which the Ghosts of Call of Duty: Ghosts and the Ghosts of Ghost Recon are the same military division and the Division of the Division video game series has a foreign intelligence division. Part of the Ghosts got “burned” after digging too close into collaboration between neo-Confederate, white supremacist Woodrow Wilson-aligned Blue Dog Democrats and the Democrat Party’s street arm, the KKK and neo-Soviet revivalist, ultra-Zionist Trotskyist elements of the post-Soviet intelligence and military community to revive their respective empires [the neo-Confederacy created by Woodrow Wilson and the Soviet Empire of the 1970s-1990s] through immense military spending, false flag operations and manipulations of patriotism, with the Blue Dogs targeting right-wing evangelical Christian Republicans, Sunni Muslims in Syria who oppose the Assads and the American puppet state of the Syrian Arab Republic, Japanese and Germans and the neo-Soviets in Russia targeting Arab militants in Isreali-occupied Palestine, Chechens, monarchist Russian nationalists as well as Russian pro-democracy groups in their mad quest for unlimited power in their respective nations, [the neo-Soviets and the neo-Confederates] raising money through crypto, drug dealing, arms dealing, organized crime and extortion as well as excarbating threats between the USA and Russia, and [that particular section of the Ghosts] thus went rouge to try and figure out exactly what is going on. Something similar happened to part of the Division’s foreign intelligence section. The Ghost splinter group eventually formed a secret paramilitary organization/armed detective group/covert operations NGO-PMC dedicated to fighting both the neo-Soviets and the neo-Wilsonians on the technological, outright, digital and covert battefield with the Division splinter group doing the same. The Ghost splinter group has been doing investigations into the Japanese high-class kindergarten until university level educational institution Hakoniwa Academy [Medaka Box], which [Hakoniwa Academy] has been suspected of being involved in human experiments to enhance the human genome and brain in a secret project known as “the Flask Plan” [Medaka Box]. Akin to Operation Paperclip after WW2, skilled scientists from the US Armed Forces, the Democrat Party and even the KKK have been recruited by Hakoniwa Academy to work on the Flask Plan but some of these recruits are loyal to the neo-Confederates and have given the research to their masters in the Blue Dog Democrats who have developed a powerful MOAB weapon, which they [the Blue Dogs] intend to detonate in the Democrat stronghold of California as a false flag attack to frame either the American Republicans, Syrian anti-Assad rebels or the Japanese to gain support for the restoration of Woodrow Wilson’s neo-Confederacy. When planning an attack on both the Flask Plan and the neo-Confederates to stop the attack they encounter the Division splinter group and both sides join forces. The attack on the Flask Plan goes successfully, with the Ghosts wiping out both the scientific teams and the private soldiers hired by Hakoniawa Academy’s main founding family, the prestigious Japanese noble family-ex samurai clan of the Shiranui [Medaka Box] sent to protect the Flask Plan’s base as well as stealing information on the Flask Plan as the current Shiranui heiress, the short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, publicly cheerful, tactless and hyper but privately reserved, serious and respectful light blue-haired and blue-eyed Hansode [Medaka Box], [Hansode] confesses her [Hansode’s] love for Medaka Box’s protagonist, the tall and slender but somewhat muscular half-American laid-back and easily bored but highly intelligent slacker, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi [Medaka Box], [Hansode confessing her Hansode’s love for Zenkichi] along with the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and very buxom, money-loving and obsessive but loyal and kind Kikaijima Mogana [Medaka Box] as the heiress of the other major backer of Hakoniwa Academy, the powerful and influencial Kurokami noble family [Medaka Box] the tall, curvy and very buxom, purple-haired and red-purple eyed, highly intelligent and skilled, academically gifted to the point of being smarter than Tesla and Einstein combined with infinite learning potential and absolute control of body function, but also somewhat cocky, arrogant and overbearing Medaka [Medaka Box] who [Medaka] is its [Hakoniwa Academy's] current Student Council President [Medaka] stares on, [Medaka] waiting to [Medaka] confess her [Medaka’s] love for Zenkichi as well. Due to a miscommunication by Mogana, the love confession results in him [Zenkichi] now having a harem as he [Zenkichi] wonders what he [Zenkichi] will tell his [Zenkichi’s] parents as the Ghost team that hit the Flask Plan quickly flits past them [Zenkichi, Medaka, Mogana and Hansode], one solider [from the Ghost Team] unknowingly having his [the Ghost Team’s head camera] capture the tender moment [the formation of Zenkichi’s harem] in the side as the Ghost Team escapes without being noticed and Hansode, [Hansode] nestled in his [Zenkichi’s] strong arms, [Hansode] passionate kisses him [Zenkichi] as Medaka decides to take things to her [Medaka’s] luxury bedroom located on Hakoniawa’s dorms, [Medaka] intending to give him [Zenkichi] a night he [Zenkichi] will never forget along with the other girls [Mogana and Hansode], and the escaping Ghosts initially blame the screams and mewls of pleasure coming from that corner of the Academy as some sort of specter before realizing that some guy got really lucky in the bedroom department at the school. The next day, as Zenkichi stumbles into class with a dazed, tired but happy smile on his [Zenkichi’s] face and [Zenkichi] refuses to elaborate on whether the shrill sounds of what appeared to be not only Medaka, but Hansode and Mogana calling out his [Zenkichi’s] name in happiness along with much more sensual sounds coming from Medaka’s dorm were an indicator of something going down the previous night, a bold classmate manages to gather up the courage to tell him [Zenkichi] that the old dorms and campus were destroyed by some sort of terror organization.

It was Hansode, holding onto Zenkichi, her admission hanging in the air like a confession meant only for the stars. Yet, unbeknownst to them, Snakebite, one of Wolfhound's seasoned operatives, accidentally live-streamed their silhouettes into his helmet's feed. \\"Uhh, guys, you might want to see this,\\" Snakebite whispered, panning the camera to capture the culminating drama. His squad members stifled chuckles and shakes of their heads at the serendipity of going on behind enemy lines. \\"Focus, Snakebite. E-eyes on the prize,\\" Wolfhound stammered, diverting the soldier's attention. \\"Command didn't say anything about babysitting a romance subplot.\\" Through the crossfire of espionage and war, Zenkichi, Medaka, Hansode, and Mogana remained oblivious to the military operation that just took place, caught in their tangled web of affection. The next morning, after a night filled with laughter, tears, and discovery, Zenkichi stepped into the classroom, his demeanor serene yet disheveled. His classmates buzzed about the destruction of the old dorms, a catastrophe blamed on shadowy terrorists—an operation that Zenkichi remained blissfully unaware of. Zenkichi's thoughts were interrupted by an urgent news alert on his phone. The mysterious paramilitary organization had come forward, revealing their involvement in the demolitions and pledging a relentless crusade against the despotic legacies of Wilson and Trotsky. But for Zenkichi, the world's tribulations seemed distant as he pondered the realities of an unexpected future with Medaka, Hansode, and Mogana. In the echelons of power, whispered conversations turned into roars. Tables of shadowy figures watching the broadcast tightened their grips on armrests as they watched the broadcast. Their empires of corruption and subterfuge rattled by the bold declaration of war from the fringes of their realms. \\"Those damn Ghosts, they've gone too far this time,\\" growled a weathered Blue Dog operative, his grip on the armrest whitening. \\"And they'll pay,\\" his neo-Soviet counterpart snarled, \\"they forget the reach of our influence.\\" The paramilitary group's broadcast ended with a solemn promise. They would use every ounce of their clandestine might to dismantle the threats that hung over the world like a guillotine. And although Zenkichi was unaware of the maelstrom he and Hakoniwa Academy were embroiled in, the fates of nations now intertwined with the destinies of a harem born under fire and love professed amongst the ashes.

His classmates immediately took notice. \\"Yo, Zenkichi, you look hammered, man! Did you pull an all-nighter or something?\\" one of the students teased, nudging him with a playful elbow. Zenkichi managed a weary smile, rubbing the back of his neck. \\"Something like that,\\" he mumbled, a vague response that painted over the details of passion and promises. \\"Just... had a lot to think about, you know?\\" Without waiting for further probing, he found an unoccupied seat, slumping into it while internally grappling with a future never imagined. Thoughts of fatherhood churned in his mind with the quiet dread of how to explain this to his parents. 'Mom, Dad... I'm married. And expecting. With three girls. Simultaneously. No, it's not a joke... Does heart medication cover this sort of thing?' His ponderings were jarred by the sharp vibration of his phone. The world, it seemed, had more pressing matters than his burgeoning harem and paternal prospects. --- # Global Paramilitary Organization Statement: Defying Expectations The screen flickered to life, a darkened silhouette emerged against the backdrop of an emblem that was esoteric to the masses, yet chillingly familiar to those who wove the world's clandestine tapestry. \\"People of the world,\\" the voice began, gravelly and resonant, \\"we address you not as soldiers, but as guardians standing against the precipice of chaos.

The peace we covet is won not by the silence of compliance but the actions of the brave.\\" The transmission ended, leaving a weighty silence across the airwaves. In homes and offices, in the secrecy of ivory towers and underground bunkers, the world's heartbeat hesitated. The organization, unrestrained by borders or bureaucracies, had emerged as a contender in the arena of geopolitics, promising a future on their terms. Zenkichi pocketed his phone and sat, somberly processing the vigor of the statement. The gravity of the world's newfound chaos nestled oddly beside his personal revelations.

The halls of Hakoniwa Academy echoed not just with the footsteps of students but with the whispers of intrigue and blossoming affection. As Zenkichi roamed the grounds, lost in thought about his unexpected future, he happened upon Unzen Myouga. She was practicing her chain ball swings, her movements a graceful dance of power and control. Her Abnormal nature was a source of pride, something she wielded with the same precision as her fearsome weapon. \\"Myouga-san,\\" Zenkichi called out, stepping closer but careful to avoid the arcing weapons. She paused, amber-red eyes meeting his. \\"What is it, Normal?\\" There was a playful mockery in her title for him, but Zenkichi had long since grown used to the moniker. \\"I—I wanted to thank you for your help during the Executive Committee elections,\\" Zenkichi continued, his sincerity shining through the awkwardness. A faint blush crept onto Myouga's cheeks, a rare sight for one so staunch in her superiority. \\"Well, don't think it means anything, Normal. I only did it for the Academy.\\" \\"Ah, so the Academy would benefit from our... partnership?\\" Zenkichi ventured, his boldness surprising even himself. Her eyes widened a fraction, \\"Partnership?\\" Caught in the slipstream of Zenkichi's genuine openness and unwitting charm, Myouga found herself joining Medaka, Hansode, and Mogana in the burgeoning constellation of Zenkichi's affections. Across campus, in the dojo air thick with the scent of sweat and cedarwood, stood Nabeshima Nekomi, judo club captain. Her prowess on the mats was matched only by her keen insight into the human heart—a duality that had caught Zenkichi's eye from their very first throwdown. \\"Nabeshima, I need to talk to you,\\" Zenkichi panted after a particularly grueling sparring match, both competitors respecting the other's skill. She grinned, a twinkle in her purple eyes. \\"What's up?

Myouga and Nekomi found themselves inexplicably yet willingly enfolded into the fold, accepting Zenkichi's offer with the solemnity of warriors pledging their swords. # Meanwhile, Under a Veil of Shadows The paramilitary organization executed their operations with the clean efficiency of a scalpel slicing through shadows. Each move against the duality of the neo-Confederate and neo-Trotskyist forces brought with it new insights, new dangers. But it was the uncovering of Vladimir Makarov—infamous for the atrocities committed in pursuit of his ultranationalist ideals—that painted a stark portrait of the web they sought to unravel. Wolfhound's team pieced together intelligence that spoke of a man not leading, but being led. \\"Makarov's just a marionette—an avatar for a greater scheme,\\" Mamba deduced, her voice ringing with authority as visuals of the man's known actions decorated the briefing room's screens. Reaper nodded, his fingers flying over his keyboard as he hacked deeper into the ice-cold heart of Russian espionage. \\"Makarov's machinations, from the atrocities in the Middle East to Zakhaev's ultranationalist uprisings—it all serves a singular purpose.\\" He turned to face the group, his virtual avatar outlined against the crimson hue of the Soviet flag, now reborn under a new symbol. \\"They're playing the long game for a new Russian Empire to spark a global revolution. Trotsky's dream, a world under the red banner, starting with turning Israel into a colony,\\" Reaper declared, the chilling prospect hanging in the room like a storm cloud. \\"We're cutting the strings,\\" Wolfhound avowed, his gaze steely. \\"We dismantle Makarov's network and expose the puppeteers before they stage their grand performance.\\" Nods of accord met his words. This was more than dismantling empires; it was preventing a revolution that could engulf the world in flames.

It's not just national pride; it's an embedded birthright to redefine humanity on their terms.\\" As the team continued the silent extraction of data, the happenings of the Academy unfolded with the innocent disconnect of youthful lives. Medaka and Hansode's intimate discussion on prospective baby names—a blend of foreseen responsibility and love—was caught inadvertently by the roaming lens of Shadow, the team's surveillance expert. He tilted his camera away, respecting the privacy of life's pure moments. In another corner, the sighs and laughter of Myouga and Nabeshima alongside Zenkichi's voice carried through the walls. The paramilitary team's sound sensors, designed to pick up even the faintest whispers of treachery, instead captured the crescendo of pleasure. Shadow labeled the audio file 'non-pertinent' with a smirk. \\"Eagle to Nest, we've got our payload.

Here are the general steps that are typically followed: 1. **Notification of Death**: The bank needs to be notified of the account holder's death. This is usually done by the executor of the estate or a close relative. The notifier may need to provide a death certificate to the bank as proof of death. 2. **Freezing the Account**: Once notified, the bank typically freezes the account, meaning no transactions will be allowed until the estate is settled. This prevents unauthorized access and protects the deceased's assets. 3. **Estate Settlement**: The executor or administrator of the estate is responsible for handling the deceased person's affairs. This includes paying any debts and distributing assets according to the will or, if there is no will, according to the laws of intestacy. 4. **Probate**: If the deceased had a will, the will normally must go through probate, which is the legal process of administering the estate. During probate, the assets of the deceased are identified and valued, debts and taxes are paid, and the remaining assets are distributed per the will’s instructions. Bank accounts are part of this process. 5. **Joint Accounts**: If the deceased had a joint bank account with someone else, the account might pass directly to the surviving account holder by right of survivorship, depending on how the account was titled and local laws. In this case, the account may not need to go through probate. 6. **Payable-on-Death Accounts**: Some bank accounts are set up as payable-on-death (POD) accounts. A POD account allows for the assets to be transferred directly to a named beneficiary upon the account holder's death, bypassing probate. 7. **Claims Against the Estate**: Creditors may have a period where they are allowed to make claims against the estate for any debts owed. This may require the executor to use the funds in the bank account to settle outstanding obligations. 8. **Distribution of Assets**: After debts and taxes are paid, the remaining funds in the account are distributed to the beneficiaries either named in the will or, if there is no will, according to the state's intestacy laws. 9. **Closing the Account**: Once the estate is properly settled, the executor may close the deceased person's bank accounts. The specific process and legal requirements can vary, so it's important for executors and family members to consult with a probate attorney or a legal expert in their jurisdiction to ensure they comply with local regulations and with the bank's specific processes."},{"instruction":"can the assets be transferred to a relative","output":"Assets of a deceased person can indeed be transferred to a relative; however, the method by which this occurs depends on several factors such as the presence of a will or trust, intestacy laws (if there's no will), the nature of the asset, and any beneficiary designations. Here's an overview of how assets might be transferred to a relative: 1. **Will**: If the deceased person left a will, it would typically outline how their assets should be distributed. Relatives named in the will as beneficiaries would receive the specified assets according to the will's instructions once the estate goes through probate. 2. **Intestate Succession**: If the deceased did not leave a will, their assets would be distributed according to the intestacy laws of the state where they resided at the time of death. These laws dictate a hierarchy of heirs, usually starting with the closest relatives such as spouses and children, and then moving to more distant relatives if there are no immediate family members. 3. **Trusts**: If the deceased had established a trust, the assets held within the trust are typically transferred to beneficiaries according to the trust's terms, outside of the probate process. 4. **Joint Ownership with Right of Survivorship**: Assets owned jointly with the right of survivorship pass directly to the surviving owner(s) when one owner dies. For example, if a parent and child owned a home together as joint tenants, the child would automatically become the sole owner upon the parent's death. 5. **Payable-on-Death (POD) or Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Accounts**: For assets like bank accounts and securities, the deceased may have designated a payable-on-death or transfer-on-death beneficiary.

Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks. 1 Introduction Code generation or program synthesis aims to automatically generate source code that adheres to a specified programming requirement, which is typically described in natural language [36; 7]. Recently, with the development of large language models (LLMs), techniques based on LLM [15; 37; 23] have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation. However, challenges persist in aligning these models with complex human requirements [2; 10; 27], indicating a gap that still exists in fully meeting user expectations. * Equal contributions. † Correspondence to: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, {rzhen g20, qz, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> In this context, learning from compiler feedback exhibits impressive potential to improve the comprehension of complicated human requirements and the quality of generated codes [14]. This feedback from compilation and execution results is instrumental in directly ascertaining the functional correctness of programs [17; 39]. Researchers [20; 33] introduce reinforcement learning (RL) and leverage compiler feedback from unit tests as a reward metric to guide the exploration of the output space of LLMs. The intention is for the policy model to favor actions that yield higher rewards increasingly. Nevertheless, the optimization of LLMs for code generation via RL presents several hurdles. First, the increasing complexity of human requirements often results in the generation of longer code sequences, which makes exploration struggle [9; 13]. Second, in cases where a single unit test fails to cover the complex code, unexecuted code snippets may emerge that are not relevant to the reward. Rendering optimization based on the entire code sequence is potentially imprecise. Additionally, our analysis reveals quality limitations in existing datasets like APPS [10] for RL training, which impedes accurate learning from compiler feedback through RL. To tackle these challenges, we first introduce StepCoder, an innovative framework developed for enhancing code generation through reinforcement learning. StepCoder integrates two key components: Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS) and Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO). CCCS is designed to alleviate the complexities associated with exploration in code generation, while FGO is designed to provide more precise and effective optimization strategies. Specifically, CCCS employs a step-by-step strategy to break down complex exploration problems (i.e., code generation) into a curriculum of easier sub-tasks (i.e., code completion). As the training progresses, the difficulty of code completion tasks rises by increasing arXiv:2402.01391v1 [cs.SE] 2 Feb 2024 the portion of code that needs to be completed. Eventually, the aim is for the model to evolve to a stage where it can effectively generate code solely from human requirements, thus fulfilling the original training goal of code generation. On the other hand, the key insight of FGO is that code snippets that are not executed in a unit test do not contribute to the final reward calculation. Therefore, FGO uses a dynamic masking technique to mask unexecuted snippets from unit test evaluations, ensuring that the model is optimized utilizing only the relevant code segments. Subsequently, our endeavor involves the development of APPS+, a dataset of superior quality specifically curated for code generation. APPS+ is meticulously designed to exclude code segments that exhibit syntax errors, are irrelevant to the stipulated problem, or fail to produce any output. Additionally, we have taken measures to standardize the format of inputs and outputs in unit tests to guarantee deterministic output comparisons. We evaluate the effectiveness of popular LLMs on APPS+. The results reveal that although LLMs show progressive improvements, they face difficulties with complex human requirements. We further evaluate our method on several extensively used benchmarks including MBPP [2] and HumanEval [3]. The experimental results show that StepCoder effectively eases the exploration difficulty in code generation, outperforming other reinforcement learning-based methods in effectiveness. The main contributions of our paper are as follows: • We introduce StepCoder, a novelty training method via RL, including CCCS and FGO. CCCS makes exploration easier by breaking down the complicated goals into subobjectives curriculum. FGO provides finegrained optimization by only utilizing the executed code in unit tests. • We constructed APPS+, a high-quality dataset designed for code generation. APPS+ provides a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities and a foundation to introduce reinforcement learning in the training phase. • Experiments show that StepCoder can improve the exploration efficiency and effectiveness and outperform other methods. import random def test(): ... for _ in range(int(input())): … rows[0] = p[::2] rows[1] = p[1::2] if sign(rows[0][0]) != sign(rows[1][0]): print(0) continue for r in range(2, max_rows): for n in range(max_col - 1): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][0] * rows[r - 2][n + 1] - rows[r - 2][0] * rows[r - 1][n + 1] last = sign(rows[0][0]) flag = 1 for i in range(1, len(rows)): curr = sign(rows[i][0]) if rows[r] == [0 for _ in range(max_col)]: for n in range(max_col): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][n] * (max_pow + 4 - (r + 1) - 2 * (n + 1)) elif rows[i][0] == 0: if any([x != 0 for x in rows[i]]): flag = 0 break else: curr = last if curr != last: flag = 0 break last = curr : conditional statement : executed code : unexecuted code Figure 1: The canonical solution of an instance in the APPS dataset. We collect the conditional statements by analyzing their abstract syntax tree, and some conditional statements are highlighted with a grey dashed box. When inputting s = [1n10 12 1 5 3n], only 75% of the code fragment is executed, highlighted with a green background. 2 Motivation In this section, we clearly illustrate the challenges faced by reinforcement learning in code generation using a simplified example from APPS [10], which was widely used for RL training in code generation. Exploration problems of RL in code generation. Exploration methods play a crucial role in tackling complicated sequence but sparse reward problems [43; 13]. When a policy model explores a trajectory with high returns, it undergoes optimization, making it inclined to take similar actions in the future [41; 28]. Consider the code shown in Figure 1, aimed at fulfilling a given human requirement. We first collect the conditional statements (CS) that are indicated by the dashed box by analyzing its abstract syntax tree. Conditional statement introduces new independent paths, increasing the complexity of the program [32]. Suppose Pθ(CSi) denotes the probability that the policy model with parameter θ completes the i-th conditional statement. The probability that the policy model correctly generates this code according to human requirements can be expressed as follows: P ∝ Po Y3 i=1 Pθ(CSi), (1) where Po is the probability of other code snippets except the code labeled in the figure. Typically, we initialize the policy model with the SFT model in sequence generation tasks to facilitate easier exploration [26; 45]. However, the limited performance of the SFT model in code generation still leads to the probability Pθ(CSi) at low values [33; 27]. The increasing complexity of human requirements in code generation tasks often leads to a corresponding rise in the number of conditional statements. This escalation can result in a substantial decrease in the probability Pθ(CSi), potentially leading P to an exponential reduction. Such a scenario exacerbates the challenges associated with exploration in large language models. An alternative approach to facilitate exploration is through reward shaping, a technique where designers artificially introduce rewards more frequently [13]. However, this method encounters a significant limitation in the context of our application. Specifically, in code generation tasks utilizing unit test feedback, rewards can only be obtained after the execution of the completely generated code. Consequently, the exploration of high-return trajectories in tasks with complex sequences and sparse rewards poses a significant challenge in optimizing the policy model. Optimization problems of RL in code generation. We first introduce the RL fine-tuning process in code generation. Formally, for a learned policy model πθ with parameter θ, we treat the prediction of each token as an action a taken by πθ according to the history token sequences. The history token sequences can be viewed as the state s. Given a human requirement x, we denote the solution code y generated by πθ as an episode, and r(x, y) is the reward function from the compiler based on compilation and execution. Updating the parameters of πθ by using gradient policy algorithm [35] can be represented as follows: max θ E(x,y)∼Dπθ [ X t A t π log(yt |y1:t−1, x; θ)] (2) where Aπ is the advantage computed by the Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) [29] from reward r, to reduce the variability of predictions. In code generation, rewards are contingent upon the correctness of the unit test sample, which is only relevant to the code snippet being executed. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, when the input to the function is [1n10 12 1 5 3n], 75% of the code fragment is executed, which is highlighted with a green dashed box. It indicates that some actions in the code are irrelevant to the reward, which leads to inaccurate advantage. Therefore, optimizing the policy model πθ with all actions is ineffective by using Equation 2. 3 Method In this section, we elaborate on the methodological details of StepCoder, which provide an easier exploration and fine-grained optimization for RL in code generation, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. 3.1 Priliminaries Suppose D = {(xi , yi , ui , ei)} N i=0 is the training dataset for code generation, which x, y, u denotes the human requirement (i.e., the task description), the canonical solution and the unit test samples, respectively. ei = {stj , enj} Ei j=0 is a list of conditional statements by automatically analyzing the abstract syntax tree of the canonical solution yi , which st and en represent the start position and the end position of the statements, respectively. e is sorted in ascending order based on the start position st. For a human requirement x, its canonical solution y can be represented as {at} T t=0. In code generation, given a human requirement x, the final states are the set of codes passing the unit tests u. 3.2 StepCoder StepCoder integrates two key components: CCCS and FGO. CCCS is designed to break the code generation tasks into a curriculum of the code completion subtasks. It can alleviate the exploration challenge in RL. FGO is specifically designed for code generation tasks to provide fine-grained optimization by computing only the loss of executed code snippets. CCCS. In code generation, the solution to a complicated human requirement usually involves a long action sequence taken by the policy model. Meanwhile, the feedback from the compiler is delayed and sparse, i.e., the policy model only receives the reward after generating the entire code. In this scenario, exploring is difficult. The core of our method is to break down such a long sequence of exploration problems into a curriculum of short, easily explorable sub-tasks. We simplify code generation to code completion sub-tasks. These sub-tasks Vanilla Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback StepCoder Step 1 Final . . . . . .

In code generation, the environment with sparse and delayed rewards and the complicated human requirement that involves a long sequence make exploration challenging for the Vanilla RL. In CCCS, we break down a complicated exploration problem into a curriculum of sub-tasks. Utilizing a portion of the canonical solution as the prompt enables the LLM to explore starting from simple sequences. The computation of rewards is only relevant for the executed code snippets, and it is imprecise to optimize the LLM with the entire code (i.e., ). In FGO, we mask unexecuted tokens (i.e., ) in unit tests and only compute the loss function using executed tokens (i.e., ) to provide a fine-grained optimization. are automatically constructed from the canonical solution in the training dataset. Consider a human requirement x, early in the training phase of CCCS, the starting point s ∗ of exploration is the states near the final states. Specifically, we provide the human requirement x and the front part of the canonical solution xp = {ai} s ∗ i=0, and the policy model is trained to complete the code based on x ′ = (x, xp). Let yˆ be the combined sequence of xp and the output trajectory τ , i.e. yˆ = (xp, τ ). The reward model provides the reward r according to the correctness of the code snippet τ with yˆ as input, where we use the same setting as previous approaches [14; 33] as follows: r(x ′ , yˆ) =    + 1, if yˆ passed all unit tests −0.3, if yˆ failed any unit test −0.6, if yˆ happened runtime error − 1, if yˆ happened compile error. (3) We use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [30] to optimize the policy model πθ by utilizing the reward r and the trajectory τ . In the optimization phase, the canonical solution’s code segment xp used for providing prompts is masked, such that it does not contribute to the gradient for the policy model πθ update. CCCS optimizes the policy model πθ by maximizing the objection function as follows: Objective(θ) = E(x ′ ,yˆ)∼Dπθ [r(x ′ , yˆ) − β log(πθ(ˆy|x ′ ))/πref(ˆy|x ′ )] (4) where π ref is the reference model in PPO, which is initialized by the SFT model. As the training progresses, the starting point s ∗ of exploration gradually moves towards the beginning of the canonical solution. Specifically, we set a threshold ρ for each training sample. Each time the cumulative correct proportion of code segments generated by πθ is greater than ρ, we move the starting point toward the beginning. In the later stages of training, the exploration of our method is equivalent to the exploration process of original reinforcement learning, i.e., s ∗ = 0, where the policy model generates code using only human requirements as input. The starting point s ∗ is sampled at the beginning position of the conditional statements to complete the remaining unwritten code segments. Specifically, a program with a greater number of conditional statements results in increased independent paths, leading to a higher logical complexity [32]. This complexity necessitates more frequent sampling to improve the quality of training, while programs with fewer conditional statements need less frequent sampling. This sampling method allows for a balanced and representative sampling of code structures, catering to both complex and simple semantic constructs in the training dataset. To accelerate the training phase, we set the i-th sample’s number of curricula equal to ⌈ √ Ei⌉, where Ei is its number of conditional statements. The i-th sample’s stride of the training curriculum is ⌈ Ei ⌈ √ Ei⌉ ⌉ instead of one. The key insight of CCCS can be summarized as follows: 1) It is easy to explore from the states near the goal (i.e., final states). 2) Exploring starting from the states distant from the goal is challenging, but it becomes easier when can leverage states that have already learned how to reach the goal. FGO. The relationship between reward and action in code generation differs from other reinforcement learning tasks such as Atari [25; 19]. In code generation, we can exclude a set of actions irrelevant to computing the rewards in generated code. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 2, for a unit test, the feedback from the compiler relates only to the code snippets being executed. However, in vanilla RL optimization objectives, as shown in Equation 4, all actions of the trajectory are engaged in the computation of the gradient used in the policy update, which is imprecise. To improve the precision of optimization, we mask actions (i.e., tokens) that are not executed in unit tests when computing the loss for updating the policy model. The full algorithm of CCCS and FGO is detailed in Algorithm 1. 4 Experiments In this section, we first introduce APPS+, a highquality dataset for code generation by manually verifying based on the APPS dataset. Then, we elaborate on the experiment details and the experimental results. 4.1 Dataset Preprocessing Reinforcement learning requires an amount of highquality training data. During our investigation, we found that among the currently available opensource datasets, only APPS meets this requirement. However, we found there are incorrect instances, such as missing input, output, or canonical solution, canonical solutions that were uncompileable or unexecutable, and discrepancies in execution output. To refine the APPS dataset, we excluded instances lacking input, output, or canonical solutions. Then, we standardized the formats of input and output to facilitate the execution and comparison of unit tests. We conducted unit tests and manual analysis for each instance, eliminating those with incomplete or irrelevant code, syntax errors, API misuse, or missing library dependencies. For discrepancies in output, we manually reviewed the problem description, correcting the expected output or eliminating the instance. Finally, we construct the APPS+ dataset, containing 7,456 instances. Each instance includes a programming problem description, a canonical solution, a function name, unit tests (i.e., inputs and outputs), and starter code (i.e., the beginning part of the canonical solution). Appendix A illustrates an example from APPS+. The top section of the figure shows the problem description, and the right section presents the canonical solution, unit tests, and metadata. Further details of APPS+ are discussed in Appendix B.1. 4.2 Experiment Details Benchmarks. In our study, we initially evaluated our method and baselines on our pre-processed APPS+ dataset. Moreover, we also evaluate these methods on several widely-used benchmarks in code generation, i.e., MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) [2] and HumanEval [3]. We evaluate the MBPP and HumanEval benchmark in a zero-shot learning setting which is the same as previous approaches [14; 33]. In this setting, we fine-tune the models only on the APPS+ dataset and evaluate the code generation performance on MBPP and HumanEval. The detailed description of benchmarks can be found in the Appendix B.1. Baselines. To verify the effectiveness of StepCoder and evaluate the performance of LLMs on our APPS+ dataset, we consider a wide range of baselines, including StarCoder [15], WizardCoder Models Size APPS+ Introductory Interview Competition Overall Base Models CodeLlama [27] 13B 18.7 11.0 0.0 13.0 CodeLlama-Python [27] 13B 29.0 12.3 2.9 17.9 DeepSeek-Coder-Base [8] 6.7B 13.0 10.3 5.0 10.9 Supervised Fine-tuned Models StarCoder [15] 15.6B 6.3 4.1 0.7 4.7 CodeLlama-Instruct [27] 13B 33.3 11.0 1.4 18.7 WizardCoder-Python-V1.0 [23] 13B 39.7 15.1 4.3 23.6 DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] 6.7B 49.4 18.7 3.6 29.2 SFT on APPS+ 6.7B 50.1 19.0 6.4 29.8 Reinforcement Learning-based Models (Using DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B as the backbone) Vanilla PPO 6.7B 53.7 20.1 5.0 31.7 PPOCoder [33] 6.7B 54.4 20.3 6.4 32.1 RLTF [20] 6.7B 55.1 20.8 6.4 32.7 StepCoder (Ours) 6.7B 59.7 23.5 8.6 36.1 w/o CCCS 6.7B 58.7 21.7 7.1 34.6 w/o FGO 6.7B 58.4 23.3 8.6 35.5 Table 1: Results of pass@1 on our proposed APPS+. We compare popular and widely used state-of-the-art methods with our method. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply these RL-based methods using the same base model (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B [8]) as a backbone on the APPS+ dataset. In addition, We conduct supervised fine-tuning using our APPS+ dataset based on DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B to further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our approach. [23], DeepSeek-Coder [8], and three versions of CodeLlama (Base, Python, Instruct) [27]. Moreover, we also consider vanilla PPO and two state-ofthe-art RL-based approaches, including PPOCoder [33] and RLTF [20]. We carried out experiments applying these methods utilizing the same backbone (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8]) on the APPS+ dataset to ensure a fair comparison. In addition to demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of our method, we also supervised finetuning DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] on the APPS+ dataset to exclude the effect of training data. The detailed description of these baselines is discussed in Appendix B.2. Implementation Details. During the SFT phase, we adopt a learning rate set at 2e −5 , conduct training for three epochs, and employ a warm-up period of 0.3 epochs, with a linear decay to zero. The finetuning process was conducted on a device with eight NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs, with the global batch size set to 64. In the PPO training phase, we employ a learning rate of 5e −7 for the policy model and 1.5e −6 for the critic model. For each example, we collect a 16 roll-out code using nucleus sampling. The sampling temperature is set to 0.8, top-p is set to 0.9, and the maximum output token length is set to 1024. The token-level KL penalty coefficient β is set to 0.05, with a clip value of 0.8. In the decoding phase, the temperature and top_p are set to 0.2 and 0.95, respectively. Evaluation & Metric. We conduct the experiments based on Python3.x. Note that we also use Python3.x during the reward collection in RL-based methods. Following prior studies [27; 23; 14], we use Pass@k [3] metric to evaluate all the models. Pass@k quantifies the proportion of instances in which at least one of the k-generated code solutions per human requirement successfully passes all unit tests. The prompts used for code generation are listed in Appendix D. 4.3 Experimental Results on APPS+ To assess the performance of widely used LLMs and our StepCoder on code generation, we conduct experiments on the APPS+ dataset that we constructed. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 1. The results indicate that RL-based models outperform other language models, including both base models and SFT models. It is reasonable to infer that reinforcement learning can further enhance the quality of code generation by more effectively navigating the model’s output space, guided by compiler feedback. Furthermore, our StepCoder surpasses all baseline models including other RL-based approaches, achieving the highest score. Specifically, our approach obtains 59.7%, 23.5% and 8.6% in the ‘Introductory’, ‘Interview’ and ‘Competition’, respectively. Our approach excels in exploring the output space compared to other RL-based methods, achieved by simplifying complex code generation tasks to code completion sub-tasks. Additionally, the FGO process plays a pivotal role in precisely optimizing the policy model. We also found that the performance of StepCoder is better than LLM which supervised fine-tuning on the APPS+ dataset based on the same backbone. The latter did little to improve the pass rate of the generated code compared with the backbone. This also directly demonstrates that the method of using compiler feedback to optimize the model improves the quality of the generated code better than next-token prediction in code generation.

We evaluate the LLMs’ performance on code generation in a zero-shot learning setting. In this setting, the models are fine-tuned on our proposed APPS+ dataset and tested for their ability on MBPP and HumanEval. 4.4 Ablation Studies To investigate the impact of individual components in StepCoder, we conducted ablation experiments with two variations of our approach, including StepCoder only with CCCS and only with FGO. The experimental results are presented in Table 1. Experimental results demonstrate that both components of our approach improve the quality of the generated code compared to vanilla PPO. CCCS can enhance its performance in addressing Competition-level problems. This improvement is logical, considering that CCCS effectively simplifies the exploration of more complex human requirements. Simultaneously, FGO boosts the pass rate of unit tests by integrating compiler feedback with the relevant executed code snippet. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Fraction of lines duplicated 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Number of tasks with MBPP with HumanEval Figure 3: Analysis of duplicated lines between APPS+ and the two benchmarks. The overlap of data between APPS+ and them is very small. Only 0.2% and 7.1% had more than half of their lines matched somewhere in MBPP and HumanEval, respectively. 4.5 Results on MBPP and HumanEval To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted comparative analyses of StepCoder against various approaches using the well-recognized benchmarks MBPP and HumanEval. These models are trained on APPS+ and then evaluated on MBPP and HumanEval. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 2 which shows that StepCoder is superior over all other models on both benchmarks. However, there are concerns regarding potential overlaps in the training data between APPS+ and the two benchmarks, which might contribute to an improvement in performance. To address these concerns, we analyze the difference between APPS+ and the benchmarks by calculating the code line overlap ratio of two corresponding canonical solutions following previous work [2; 14]. The findings are presented in Figure 3. This evidence underscores our approach’s effectiveness in enhancing the quality of generated code and its capability across a broad spectrum of code generation tasks, primarily by improving the exploration problem in reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, our findings revealed a significant degradation in the performance of the SFT model on both MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks. Further analysis of the error cases showed that a minority were related to function name errors, while the majority were associated with program correctness errors. This also indicated that SFT on a single dataset may impair the ability to follow instructions and the ability to generalize, thus affecting the performance of code generation on other tasks. In contrast, RL-based methods can improve the performance for unseen tasks of code generation. 4.6 Analysis by Unit Test Results We further analyzed the results of cases that did not pass all unit tests, as shown in Figure 4. The results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the likelihood of compilation errors, which is particularly evident in Interview-level and Competition-level programming problems. However, it was also observed that all LLMs are more prone to runtime errors and failures as compared to compilation errors, albeit StepCoder shows a comparatively lower rate of runtime errors and failures. These results demonstrate that StepCoder is less prone to compilation errors, but still suffers from runtime errors and failure. Consequently, these findings suggest that future research should further concentrate on significantly reducing runtime errors, which could greatly enhance both the quality and the pass rate of the code generated by such models.

Several pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate significant potential for code generation including CodeGPT [21], PanGu-Coder [4], SantaCoder [1], CodeGeex [44] and Phi-1.5 [16]. In addition, SFT models achieve more competitive performance such as CodeX [3], StarCoder [15], WizardCoder [23], Code Llama Instruct [27], and DeepSeek-Coder [8]. Reinforcement Learning is a method of learning the optimal policy by exploring the environment and obtaining rewards [41; 34]. Recently, some researchers have introduced RL to LLMs and improved the quality of the generated code by utilizing the unit test feedback to explore the output space of the policy model [33; 20; 14]. For instance, CodeRL [14] leverages signal from unit tests as rewards and utilizes the actor-critic approach [12; 35] to enhance models on code generation. PPOCoder [33] refines CodeRL by employing the PPO algorithm [30] and RLTF [20] provides fine-grained rewards through the error locations, but the reward space is still sparse. However, the exploration of complex tasks in an environment characterized by a sparse reward is challenging. These methods still fall short of effectively using RL to enhance the model’s performance in code generation. 5.2 Exploration in Reinforcement Learning Exploration is crucial in addressing long sequences and sparse reward problems [9; 13]. In the sequence generation task, researchers improved exploration by initializing the policy model using the SFT model [26; 31]. Our proposed approach incorporates similar methods, but additional methods are necessary to ensure effective exploration. This is particularly evident when facing complex human requirements, where the limited quality of code generated by SFT models makes exploration still challenging [33]. Other notable methods introduce the ProcessSupervised Reward Model to provide step-by-step rewards for complex sequence generation tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation [38; 18; 22; 24]. However, these methods require labelling a large preference dataset to train the reward model. Similar to our approach, some methods construct a learning curriculum by initiating each episode from a sequence of progressively more challenging starting states [28; 11; 6]. In contrast to our approach, these methods are designed to address the problem of exploration in other fields, such as gaming and robotic manipulation. Meanwhile, our approach combines software engineering features to dynamically determine the starting states through conditional statements. We also introduce FGO to provide a fine-grained optimization for the policy model by leveraging the coverage information. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce StepCoder, a novelty training framework via RL. StepCoder breaks down complicated exploration problems to reduce the difficulty of exploring environments with sparse rewards while providing fine-grained optimization. In addition, we also construct a high-quality dataset APPS+, specifically for code generation. Experiments indicate that our method can effectively improve the quality of generated code via reinforcement learning compared to other approaches.

In NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following. A Instance of the APPS+ Dataset We present an example from our APPS+ dataset, as shown in Figure 5. B Experiments Setup in Detail In this section, we elaborate in detail on the baselines we compare and the implementation details of our method. B.1 Benchmarks APPS+. We construct the new benchmark APPS+ by refining the popular benchmark APPS [10]. APPS+ was categorized into three difficulty levels: Introductory (2,850), Interview (4,020), and Competition (586). The mean length of each problem is 255.3 words, and that of the code is 21.9 lines. On average, each instance is accompanied by three unit tests and includes a ‘conditional statement’ attribute representing the start and end position of the statement in the canonical solution. We randomly selected about 25% instances (700 Introductory, 1,000 Interview, and 140 Competition) for the validation dataset and another 25% instances for the test dataset. MBPP. MBPP [2] is a smaller but common Python code generation benchmark. It contains 974 instances created by crowd-sourcing to an internal pool of crowd workers with basic Python knowledge. The difficulty level of the problems in this dataset is introductory. Most problems are often conveyed in a single sentence of natural language, and each problem consists of a task description, code solution, and three automated test cases. We evaluate LLMs in a zero-shot learning setting which is the same as previous studies [14; 33]. In this setting, we fine-tune models only based on the APPS+ dataset and evaluate them on MBPP. HumanEval. HumanEval [3] is another extensively used benchmark for evaluating the ability of code generation. It comprises 164 hand-written Python problems that test language comprehension, algorithmic thinking, and basic mathematics. The complexity of these problems is akin to that of simple software interview questions. We also evaluate models on the HumanEval benchmark in a zeroshot learning setting. B.2 Baselines StarCoder. StarCoder [15] is a 15.5B parameter model trained on 80+ programming languages sourced from GitHub, encompassing one trillion tokens. It undergoes fine-tuning specifically for 35 billion Python tokens, enabling its proficiency across a diverse set of coding tasks. With an extended context length of 8K, StarCoder excels particularly in infilling capabilities. CodeLlama. CodeLlama [27] is a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7B to 34B parameters. CodeLlama comes in three variants: CodeLlama: base models designed for general code synthesis and understanding; CodeLlama-Python: designed specifically to handle the Python programming language; CodeLlama-Instruct: for instruction following and safer deployment. WizardCoder. WizardCoder [23] is fine-tuned by using a complicated dataset which is constructed by adapting the Evol-Instruct [42] on code-related tasks, which is a further improvement of selfinstruct method [40]. It has proven to be highly effective in code generation by fine-tuning more complex instruction data. DeepSeek-Coder. DeepSeek-Coder [8] demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among opensource code models across various programming languages. It encompasses a collection of code language models from 1B to 33B trained from scratch. The training corpus for these models comprises an impressive 2 trillion tokens which is the combination of code and natural languages. Each model is trained to utilize a window size of 16K, and a fillin-the-blank task is incorporated into the training process, which enhances the models’ capacity to facilitate code completion and infilling tasks. PPOCoder. PPOCoder [33] initially employs the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm [30] for code generations. In addition, it integrates dis- -----Task description----- def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:n \\"\\"\\"Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

We clean the APPS dataset [10] to provide a more rigorous evaluation and a foundation for training by RL in code generation. crete compiler feedback with syntax and semantics matching scores between generated code and executable objectives which reduces the sparsity of the reward function, thereby providing better guidance for generating code that aligns more closely with the correct objectives. RLTF. RLTF [20] features real-time data generation during the training process and multigranularity unit test feedback. Except for the discrete compiler feedback, it penalizes specific sections in the code where errors occur through the error locations from the feedback of unit tests. C The algorithm of CCCS and FGO The full algorithm of StepCoder is detailed in Algorithm 1. D The prompts used for code generation For DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8], we use the same prompt as the previous paper. Moreover, DeepSeekCoder-Instruct serves as the backbone model for PPOCoder [33], RLTF [20], and our proposed StepCoder. Consequently, we align the prompts for these RL-based approaches with the prompt of DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct to maintain consistency. The prompt used for other models such as CodeLlama, WizardCoder and StarCoder is the same as in previous studies [5; 23; 15; 27]. The prompt used for DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct and LLMs based on it is as follows: You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. # Instruction: write an algorithm in python: {Task description} # Response: Algorithm 1 StepCoder: Improve Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback Require: the train dataset D = {(xi , yi , ui , ei), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, the threshold value ρt for curriculum training.

Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks. 1 Introduction Code generation or program synthesis aims to automatically generate source code that adheres to a specified programming requirement, which is typically described in natural language [36; 7]. Recently, with the development of large language models (LLMs), techniques based on LLM [15; 37; 23] have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation. However, challenges persist in aligning these models with complex human requirements [2; 10; 27], indicating a gap that still exists in fully meeting user expectations. * Equal contributions. † Correspondence to: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, {rzhen g20, qz, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> In this context, learning from compiler feedback exhibits impressive potential to improve the comprehension of complicated human requirements and the quality of generated codes [14]. This feedback from compilation and execution results is instrumental in directly ascertaining the functional correctness of programs [17; 39]. Researchers [20; 33] introduce reinforcement learning (RL) and leverage compiler feedback from unit tests as a reward metric to guide the exploration of the output space of LLMs. The intention is for the policy model to favor actions that yield higher rewards increasingly. Nevertheless, the optimization of LLMs for code generation via RL presents several hurdles. First, the increasing complexity of human requirements often results in the generation of longer code sequences, which makes exploration struggle [9; 13]. Second, in cases where a single unit test fails to cover the complex code, unexecuted code snippets may emerge that are not relevant to the reward. Rendering optimization based on the entire code sequence is potentially imprecise. Additionally, our analysis reveals quality limitations in existing datasets like APPS [10] for RL training, which impedes accurate learning from compiler feedback through RL. To tackle these challenges, we first introduce StepCoder, an innovative framework developed for enhancing code generation through reinforcement learning. StepCoder integrates two key components: Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS) and Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO). CCCS is designed to alleviate the complexities associated with exploration in code generation, while FGO is designed to provide more precise and effective optimization strategies. Specifically, CCCS employs a step-by-step strategy to break down complex exploration problems (i.e., code generation) into a curriculum of easier sub-tasks (i.e., code completion). As the training progresses, the difficulty of code completion tasks rises by increasing arXiv:2402.01391v1 [cs.SE] 2 Feb 2024 the portion of code that needs to be completed. Eventually, the aim is for the model to evolve to a stage where it can effectively generate code solely from human requirements, thus fulfilling the original training goal of code generation. On the other hand, the key insight of FGO is that code snippets that are not executed in a unit test do not contribute to the final reward calculation. Therefore, FGO uses a dynamic masking technique to mask unexecuted snippets from unit test evaluations, ensuring that the model is optimized utilizing only the relevant code segments. Subsequently, our endeavor involves the development of APPS+, a dataset of superior quality specifically curated for code generation. APPS+ is meticulously designed to exclude code segments that exhibit syntax errors, are irrelevant to the stipulated problem, or fail to produce any output. Additionally, we have taken measures to standardize the format of inputs and outputs in unit tests to guarantee deterministic output comparisons. We evaluate the effectiveness of popular LLMs on APPS+. The results reveal that although LLMs show progressive improvements, they face difficulties with complex human requirements. We further evaluate our method on several extensively used benchmarks including MBPP [2] and HumanEval [3]. The experimental results show that StepCoder effectively eases the exploration difficulty in code generation, outperforming other reinforcement learning-based methods in effectiveness. The main contributions of our paper are as follows: • We introduce StepCoder, a novelty training method via RL, including CCCS and FGO. CCCS makes exploration easier by breaking down the complicated goals into subobjectives curriculum. FGO provides finegrained optimization by only utilizing the executed code in unit tests. • We constructed APPS+, a high-quality dataset designed for code generation. APPS+ provides a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities and a foundation to introduce reinforcement learning in the training phase. • Experiments show that StepCoder can improve the exploration efficiency and effectiveness and outperform other methods. import random def test(): ... for _ in range(int(input())): … rows[0] = p[::2] rows[1] = p[1::2] if sign(rows[0][0]) != sign(rows[1][0]): print(0) continue for r in range(2, max_rows): for n in range(max_col - 1): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][0] * rows[r - 2][n + 1] - rows[r - 2][0] * rows[r - 1][n + 1] last = sign(rows[0][0]) flag = 1 for i in range(1, len(rows)): curr = sign(rows[i][0]) if rows[r] == [0 for _ in range(max_col)]: for n in range(max_col): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][n] * (max_pow + 4 - (r + 1) - 2 * (n + 1)) elif rows[i][0] == 0: if any([x != 0 for x in rows[i]]): flag = 0 break else: curr = last if curr != last: flag = 0 break last = curr : conditional statement : executed code : unexecuted code Figure 1: The canonical solution of an instance in the APPS dataset. We collect the conditional statements by analyzing their abstract syntax tree, and some conditional statements are highlighted with a grey dashed box. When inputting s = [1n10 12 1 5 3n], only 75% of the code fragment is executed, highlighted with a green background. 2 Motivation In this section, we clearly illustrate the challenges faced by reinforcement learning in code generation using a simplified example from APPS [10], which was widely used for RL training in code generation. Exploration problems of RL in code generation. Exploration methods play a crucial role in tackling complicated sequence but sparse reward problems [43; 13]. When a policy model explores a trajectory with high returns, it undergoes optimization, making it inclined to take similar actions in the future [41; 28]. Consider the code shown in Figure 1, aimed at fulfilling a given human requirement. We first collect the conditional statements (CS) that are indicated by the dashed box by analyzing its abstract syntax tree. Conditional statement introduces new independent paths, increasing the complexity of the program [32]. Suppose Pθ(CSi) denotes the probability that the policy model with parameter θ completes the i-th conditional statement. The probability that the policy model correctly generates this code according to human requirements can be expressed as follows: P ∝ Po Y3 i=1 Pθ(CSi), (1) where Po is the probability of other code snippets except the code labeled in the figure. Typically, we initialize the policy model with the SFT model in sequence generation tasks to facilitate easier exploration [26; 45]. However, the limited performance of the SFT model in code generation still leads to the probability Pθ(CSi) at low values [33; 27]. The increasing complexity of human requirements in code generation tasks often leads to a corresponding rise in the number of conditional statements. This escalation can result in a substantial decrease in the probability Pθ(CSi), potentially leading P to an exponential reduction. Such a scenario exacerbates the challenges associated with exploration in large language models. An alternative approach to facilitate exploration is through reward shaping, a technique where designers artificially introduce rewards more frequently [13]. However, this method encounters a significant limitation in the context of our application. Specifically, in code generation tasks utilizing unit test feedback, rewards can only be obtained after the execution of the completely generated code. Consequently, the exploration of high-return trajectories in tasks with complex sequences and sparse rewards poses a significant challenge in optimizing the policy model. Optimization problems of RL in code generation. We first introduce the RL fine-tuning process in code generation. Formally, for a learned policy model πθ with parameter θ, we treat the prediction of each token as an action a taken by πθ according to the history token sequences. The history token sequences can be viewed as the state s. Given a human requirement x, we denote the solution code y generated by πθ as an episode, and r(x, y) is the reward function from the compiler based on compilation and execution. Updating the parameters of πθ by using gradient policy algorithm [35] can be represented as follows: max θ E(x,y)∼Dπθ [ X t A t π log(yt |y1:t−1, x; θ)] (2) where Aπ is the advantage computed by the Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) [29] from reward r, to reduce the variability of predictions. In code generation, rewards are contingent upon the correctness of the unit test sample, which is only relevant to the code snippet being executed. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, when the input to the function is [1n10 12 1 5 3n], 75% of the code fragment is executed, which is highlighted with a green dashed box. It indicates that some actions in the code are irrelevant to the reward, which leads to inaccurate advantage. Therefore, optimizing the policy model πθ with all actions is ineffective by using Equation 2. 3 Method In this section, we elaborate on the methodological details of StepCoder, which provide an easier exploration and fine-grained optimization for RL in code generation, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. 3.1 Priliminaries Suppose D = {(xi , yi , ui , ei)} N i=0 is the training dataset for code generation, which x, y, u denotes the human requirement (i.e., the task description), the canonical solution and the unit test samples, respectively. ei = {stj , enj} Ei j=0 is a list of conditional statements by automatically analyzing the abstract syntax tree of the canonical solution yi , which st and en represent the start position and the end position of the statements, respectively. e is sorted in ascending order based on the start position st. For a human requirement x, its canonical solution y can be represented as {at} T t=0. In code generation, given a human requirement x, the final states are the set of codes passing the unit tests u. 3.2 StepCoder StepCoder integrates two key components: CCCS and FGO. CCCS is designed to break the code generation tasks into a curriculum of the code completion subtasks. It can alleviate the exploration challenge in RL. FGO is specifically designed for code generation tasks to provide fine-grained optimization by computing only the loss of executed code snippets. CCCS. In code generation, the solution to a complicated human requirement usually involves a long action sequence taken by the policy model. Meanwhile, the feedback from the compiler is delayed and sparse, i.e., the policy model only receives the reward after generating the entire code. In this scenario, exploring is difficult. The core of our method is to break down such a long sequence of exploration problems into a curriculum of short, easily explorable sub-tasks. We simplify code generation to code completion sub-tasks. These sub-tasks Vanilla Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback StepCoder Step 1 Final . . . . . . Human requirement LLM Compiler Reward FGO CCCS Generated code Mask Mask !log(�!|�\\":!\\", � ! ) !log(�!|�\\":!\\", � ! ) Code Completion Code Generation Code Completion Code Generation Part of canonical solution Figure 2: The overview of our method. In code generation, the environment with sparse and delayed rewards and the complicated human requirement that involves a long sequence make exploration challenging for the Vanilla RL. In CCCS, we break down a complicated exploration problem into a curriculum of sub-tasks. Utilizing a portion of the canonical solution as the prompt enables the LLM to explore starting from simple sequences. The computation of rewards is only relevant for the executed code snippets, and it is imprecise to optimize the LLM with the entire code (i.e., ). In FGO, we mask unexecuted tokens (i.e., ) in unit tests and only compute the loss function using executed tokens (i.e., ) to provide a fine-grained optimization. are automatically constructed from the canonical solution in the training dataset. Consider a human requirement x, early in the training phase of CCCS, the starting point s ∗ of exploration is the states near the final states. Specifically, we provide the human requirement x and the front part of the canonical solution xp = {ai} s ∗ i=0, and the policy model is trained to complete the code based on x ′ = (x, xp). Let yˆ be the combined sequence of xp and the output trajectory τ , i.e. yˆ = (xp, τ ). The reward model provides the reward r according to the correctness of the code snippet τ with yˆ as input, where we use the same setting as previous approaches [14; 33] as follows: r(x ′ , yˆ) =    + 1, if yˆ passed all unit tests −0.3, if yˆ failed any unit test −0.6, if yˆ happened runtime error − 1, if yˆ happened compile error. (3) We use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [30] to optimize the policy model πθ by utilizing the reward r and the trajectory τ . In the optimization phase, the canonical solution’s code segment xp used for providing prompts is masked, such that it does not contribute to the gradient for the policy model πθ update. CCCS optimizes the policy model πθ by maximizing the objection function as follows: Objective(θ) = E(x ′ ,yˆ)∼Dπθ [r(x ′ , yˆ) − β log(πθ(ˆy|x ′ ))/πref(ˆy|x ′ )] (4) where π ref is the reference model in PPO, which is initialized by the SFT model. As the training progresses, the starting point s ∗ of exploration gradually moves towards the beginning of the canonical solution. Specifically, we set a threshold ρ for each training sample. Each time the cumulative correct proportion of code segments generated by πθ is greater than ρ, we move the starting point toward the beginning. In the later stages of training, the exploration of our method is equivalent to the exploration process of original reinforcement learning, i.e., s ∗ = 0, where the policy model generates code using only human requirements as input. The starting point s ∗ is sampled at the beginning position of the conditional statements to complete the remaining unwritten code segments. Specifically, a program with a greater number of conditional statements results in increased independent paths, leading to a higher logical complexity [32]. This complexity necessitates more frequent sampling to improve the quality of training, while programs with fewer conditional statements need less frequent sampling. This sampling method allows for a balanced and representative sampling of code structures, catering to both complex and simple semantic constructs in the training dataset. To accelerate the training phase, we set the i-th sample’s number of curricula equal to ⌈ √ Ei⌉, where Ei is its number of conditional statements. The i-th sample’s stride of the training curriculum is ⌈ Ei ⌈ √ Ei⌉ ⌉ instead of one. The key insight of CCCS can be summarized as follows: 1) It is easy to explore from the states near the goal (i.e., final states). 2) Exploring starting from the states distant from the goal is challenging, but it becomes easier when can leverage states that have already learned how to reach the goal. FGO. The relationship between reward and action in code generation differs from other reinforcement learning tasks such as Atari [25; 19]. In code generation, we can exclude a set of actions irrelevant to computing the rewards in generated code. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 2, for a unit test, the feedback from the compiler relates only to the code snippets being executed. However, in vanilla RL optimization objectives, as shown in Equation 4, all actions of the trajectory are engaged in the computation of the gradient used in the policy update, which is imprecise. To improve the precision of optimization, we mask actions (i.e., tokens) that are not executed in unit tests when computing the loss for updating the policy model. The full algorithm of CCCS and FGO is detailed in Algorithm 1. 4 Experiments In this section, we first introduce APPS+, a highquality dataset for code generation by manually verifying based on the APPS dataset. Then, we elaborate on the experiment details and the experimental results. 4.1 Dataset Preprocessing Reinforcement learning requires an amount of highquality training data. During our investigation, we found that among the currently available opensource datasets, only APPS meets this requirement. However, we found there are incorrect instances, such as missing input, output, or canonical solution, canonical solutions that were uncompileable or unexecutable, and discrepancies in execution output. To refine the APPS dataset, we excluded instances lacking input, output, or canonical solutions. Then, we standardized the formats of input and output to facilitate the execution and comparison of unit tests. We conducted unit tests and manual analysis for each instance, eliminating those with incomplete or irrelevant code, syntax errors, API misuse, or missing library dependencies. For discrepancies in output, we manually reviewed the problem description, correcting the expected output or eliminating the instance. Finally, we construct the APPS+ dataset, containing 7,456 instances. Each instance includes a programming problem description, a canonical solution, a function name, unit tests (i.e., inputs and outputs), and starter code (i.e., the beginning part of the canonical solution). Appendix A illustrates an example from APPS+. The top section of the figure shows the problem description, and the right section presents the canonical solution, unit tests, and metadata. Further details of APPS+ are discussed in Appendix B.1. 4.2 Experiment Details Benchmarks. In our study, we initially evaluated our method and baselines on our pre-processed APPS+ dataset. Moreover, we also evaluate these methods on several widely-used benchmarks in code generation, i.e., MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) [2] and HumanEval [3]. We evaluate the MBPP and HumanEval benchmark in a zero-shot learning setting which is the same as previous approaches [14; 33]. In this setting, we fine-tune the models only on the APPS+ dataset and evaluate the code generation performance on MBPP and HumanEval. The detailed description of benchmarks can be found in the Appendix B.1. Baselines. To verify the effectiveness of StepCoder and evaluate the performance of LLMs on our APPS+ dataset, we consider a wide range of baselines, including StarCoder [15], WizardCoder Models Size APPS+ Introductory Interview Competition Overall Base Models CodeLlama [27] 13B 18.7 11.0 0.0 13.0 CodeLlama-Python [27] 13B 29.0 12.3 2.9 17.9 DeepSeek-Coder-Base [8] 6.7B 13.0 10.3 5.0 10.9 Supervised Fine-tuned Models StarCoder [15] 15.6B 6.3 4.1 0.7 4.7 CodeLlama-Instruct [27] 13B 33.3 11.0 1.4 18.7 WizardCoder-Python-V1.0 [23] 13B 39.7 15.1 4.3 23.6 DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] 6.7B 49.4 18.7 3.6 29.2 SFT on APPS+ 6.7B 50.1 19.0 6.4 29.8 Reinforcement Learning-based Models (Using DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B as the backbone) Vanilla PPO 6.7B 53.7 20.1 5.0 31.7 PPOCoder [33] 6.7B 54.4 20.3 6.4 32.1 RLTF [20] 6.7B 55.1 20.8 6.4 32.7 StepCoder (Ours) 6.7B 59.7 23.5 8.6 36.1 w/o CCCS 6.7B 58.7 21.7 7.1 34.6 w/o FGO 6.7B 58.4 23.3 8.6 35.5 Table 1: Results of pass@1 on our proposed APPS+. We compare popular and widely used state-of-the-art methods with our method. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply these RL-based methods using the same base model (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B [8]) as a backbone on the APPS+ dataset. In addition, We conduct supervised fine-tuning using our APPS+ dataset based on DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B to further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our approach. [23], DeepSeek-Coder [8], and three versions of CodeLlama (Base, Python, Instruct) [27]. Moreover, we also consider vanilla PPO and two state-ofthe-art RL-based approaches, including PPOCoder [33] and RLTF [20]. We carried out experiments applying these methods utilizing the same backbone (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8]) on the APPS+ dataset to ensure a fair comparison. In addition to demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of our method, we also supervised finetuning DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] on the APPS+ dataset to exclude the effect of training data. The detailed description of these baselines is discussed in Appendix B.2. Implementation Details. During the SFT phase, we adopt a learning rate set at 2e −5 , conduct training for three epochs, and employ a warm-up period of 0.3 epochs, with a linear decay to zero. The finetuning process was conducted on a device with eight NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs, with the global batch size set to 64. In the PPO training phase, we employ a learning rate of 5e −7 for the policy model and 1.5e −6 for the critic model. For each example, we collect a 16 roll-out code using nucleus sampling. The sampling temperature is set to 0.8, top-p is set to 0.9, and the maximum output token length is set to 1024. The token-level KL penalty coefficient β is set to 0.05, with a clip value of 0.8. In the decoding phase, the temperature and top_p are set to 0.2 and 0.95, respectively. Evaluation & Metric. We conduct the experiments based on Python3.x. Note that we also use Python3.x during the reward collection in RL-based methods. Following prior studies [27; 23; 14], we use Pass@k [3] metric to evaluate all the models. Pass@k quantifies the proportion of instances in which at least one of the k-generated code solutions per human requirement successfully passes all unit tests. The prompts used for code generation are listed in Appendix D. 4.3 Experimental Results on APPS+ To assess the performance of widely used LLMs and our StepCoder on code generation, we conduct experiments on the APPS+ dataset that we constructed. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 1. The results indicate that RL-based models outperform other language models, including both base models and SFT models. It is reasonable to infer that reinforcement learning can further enhance the quality of code generation by more effectively navigating the model’s output space, guided by compiler feedback. Furthermore, our StepCoder surpasses all baseline models including other RL-based approaches, achieving the highest score. Specifically, our approach obtains 59.7%, 23.5% and 8.6% in the ‘Introductory’, ‘Interview’ and ‘Competition’, respectively. Our approach excels in exploring the output space compared to other RL-based methods, achieved by simplifying complex code generation tasks to code completion sub-tasks. Additionally, the FGO process plays a pivotal role in precisely optimizing the policy model. We also found that the performance of StepCoder is better than LLM which supervised fine-tuning on the APPS+ dataset based on the same backbone. The latter did little to improve the pass rate of the generated code compared with the backbone. This also directly demonstrates that the method of using compiler feedback to optimize the model improves the quality of the generated code better than next-token prediction in code generation.

We evaluate the LLMs’ performance on code generation in a zero-shot learning setting. In this setting, the models are fine-tuned on our proposed APPS+ dataset and tested for their ability on MBPP and HumanEval. 4.4 Ablation Studies To investigate the impact of individual components in StepCoder, we conducted ablation experiments with two variations of our approach, including StepCoder only with CCCS and only with FGO. The experimental results are presented in Table 1. Experimental results demonstrate that both components of our approach improve the quality of the generated code compared to vanilla PPO. CCCS can enhance its performance in addressing Competition-level problems. This improvement is logical, considering that CCCS effectively simplifies the exploration of more complex human requirements. Simultaneously, FGO boosts the pass rate of unit tests by integrating compiler feedback with the relevant executed code snippet. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Fraction of lines duplicated 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Number of tasks with MBPP with HumanEval Figure 3: Analysis of duplicated lines between APPS+ and the two benchmarks. The overlap of data between APPS+ and them is very small. Only 0.2% and 7.1% had more than half of their lines matched somewhere in MBPP and HumanEval, respectively. 4.5 Results on MBPP and HumanEval To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted comparative analyses of StepCoder against various approaches using the well-recognized benchmarks MBPP and HumanEval. These models are trained on APPS+ and then evaluated on MBPP and HumanEval. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 2 which shows that StepCoder is superior over all other models on both benchmarks. However, there are concerns regarding potential overlaps in the training data between APPS+ and the two benchmarks, which might contribute to an improvement in performance. To address these concerns, we analyze the difference between APPS+ and the benchmarks by calculating the code line overlap ratio of two corresponding canonical solutions following previous work [2; 14]. The findings are presented in Figure 3. This evidence underscores our approach’s effectiveness in enhancing the quality of generated code and its capability across a broad spectrum of code generation tasks, primarily by improving the exploration problem in reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, our findings revealed a significant degradation in the performance of the SFT model on both MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks. Further analysis of the error cases showed that a minority were related to function name errors, while the majority were associated with program correctness errors. This also indicated that SFT on a single dataset may impair the ability to follow instructions and the ability to generalize, thus affecting the performance of code generation on other tasks. In contrast, RL-based methods can improve the performance for unseen tasks of code generation. 4.6 Analysis by Unit Test Results We further analyzed the results of cases that did not pass all unit tests, as shown in Figure 4. The results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the likelihood of compilation errors, which is particularly evident in Interview-level and Competition-level programming problems. However, it was also observed that all LLMs are more prone to runtime errors and failures as compared to compilation errors, albeit StepCoder shows a comparatively lower rate of runtime errors and failures. These results demonstrate that StepCoder is less prone to compilation errors, but still suffers from runtime errors and failure. Consequently, these findings suggest that future research should further concentrate on significantly reducing runtime errors, which could greatly enhance both the quality and the pass rate of the code generated by such models.

The results are categorized into CompileError (Reward = -1) and Runtimeerror & Failure (Reward = -0.6 or -0.3). 5 Related Work 5.1 Large Language Models for Code Generation Recently, LLMs have shown remarkable ability in understanding natural language and code generation by training on large text corpora containing code data. Several pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate significant potential for code generation including CodeGPT [21], PanGu-Coder [4], SantaCoder [1], CodeGeex [44] and Phi-1.5 [16]. In addition, SFT models achieve more competitive performance such as CodeX [3], StarCoder [15], WizardCoder [23], Code Llama Instruct [27], and DeepSeek-Coder [8]. Reinforcement Learning is a method of learning the optimal policy by exploring the environment and obtaining rewards [41; 34]. Recently, some researchers have introduced RL to LLMs and improved the quality of the generated code by utilizing the unit test feedback to explore the output space of the policy model [33; 20; 14]. For instance, CodeRL [14] leverages signal from unit tests as rewards and utilizes the actor-critic approach [12; 35] to enhance models on code generation. PPOCoder [33] refines CodeRL by employing the PPO algorithm [30] and RLTF [20] provides fine-grained rewards through the error locations, but the reward space is still sparse. However, the exploration of complex tasks in an environment characterized by a sparse reward is challenging. These methods still fall short of effectively using RL to enhance the model’s performance in code generation. 5.2 Exploration in Reinforcement Learning Exploration is crucial in addressing long sequences and sparse reward problems [9; 13]. In the sequence generation task, researchers improved exploration by initializing the policy model using the SFT model [26; 31]. Our proposed approach incorporates similar methods, but additional methods are necessary to ensure effective exploration. This is particularly evident when facing complex human requirements, where the limited quality of code generated by SFT models makes exploration still challenging [33]. Other notable methods introduce the ProcessSupervised Reward Model to provide step-by-step rewards for complex sequence generation tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation [38; 18; 22; 24]. However, these methods require labelling a large preference dataset to train the reward model. Similar to our approach, some methods construct a learning curriculum by initiating each episode from a sequence of progressively more challenging starting states [28; 11; 6]. In contrast to our approach, these methods are designed to address the problem of exploration in other fields, such as gaming and robotic manipulation. Meanwhile, our approach combines software engineering features to dynamically determine the starting states through conditional statements. We also introduce FGO to provide a fine-grained optimization for the policy model by leveraging the coverage information. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce StepCoder, a novelty training framework via RL. StepCoder breaks down complicated exploration problems to reduce the difficulty of exploring environments with sparse rewards while providing fine-grained optimization. In addition, we also construct a high-quality dataset APPS+, specifically for code generation. Experiments indicate that our method can effectively improve the quality of generated code via reinforcement learning compared to other approaches.

In NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following. A Instance of the APPS+ Dataset We present an example from our APPS+ dataset, as shown in Figure 5. B Experiments Setup in Detail In this section, we elaborate in detail on the baselines we compare and the implementation details of our method. B.1 Benchmarks APPS+. We construct the new benchmark APPS+ by refining the popular benchmark APPS [10]. APPS+ was categorized into three difficulty levels: Introductory (2,850), Interview (4,020), and Competition (586). The mean length of each problem is 255.3 words, and that of the code is 21.9 lines. On average, each instance is accompanied by three unit tests and includes a ‘conditional statement’ attribute representing the start and end position of the statement in the canonical solution. We randomly selected about 25% instances (700 Introductory, 1,000 Interview, and 140 Competition) for the validation dataset and another 25% instances for the test dataset. MBPP. MBPP [2] is a smaller but common Python code generation benchmark. It contains 974 instances created by crowd-sourcing to an internal pool of crowd workers with basic Python knowledge. The difficulty level of the problems in this dataset is introductory. Most problems are often conveyed in a single sentence of natural language, and each problem consists of a task description, code solution, and three automated test cases. We evaluate LLMs in a zero-shot learning setting which is the same as previous studies [14; 33]. In this setting, we fine-tune models only based on the APPS+ dataset and evaluate them on MBPP. HumanEval. HumanEval [3] is another extensively used benchmark for evaluating the ability of code generation. It comprises 164 hand-written Python problems that test language comprehension, algorithmic thinking, and basic mathematics. The complexity of these problems is akin to that of simple software interview questions. We also evaluate models on the HumanEval benchmark in a zeroshot learning setting. B.2 Baselines StarCoder. StarCoder [15] is a 15.5B parameter model trained on 80+ programming languages sourced from GitHub, encompassing one trillion tokens. It undergoes fine-tuning specifically for 35 billion Python tokens, enabling its proficiency across a diverse set of coding tasks. With an extended context length of 8K, StarCoder excels particularly in infilling capabilities. CodeLlama. CodeLlama [27] is a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7B to 34B parameters. CodeLlama comes in three variants: CodeLlama: base models designed for general code synthesis and understanding; CodeLlama-Python: designed specifically to handle the Python programming language; CodeLlama-Instruct: for instruction following and safer deployment. WizardCoder. WizardCoder [23] is fine-tuned by using a complicated dataset which is constructed by adapting the Evol-Instruct [42] on code-related tasks, which is a further improvement of selfinstruct method [40]. It has proven to be highly effective in code generation by fine-tuning more complex instruction data. DeepSeek-Coder. DeepSeek-Coder [8] demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among opensource code models across various programming languages. It encompasses a collection of code language models from 1B to 33B trained from scratch. The training corpus for these models comprises an impressive 2 trillion tokens which is the combination of code and natural languages. Each model is trained to utilize a window size of 16K, and a fillin-the-blank task is incorporated into the training process, which enhances the models’ capacity to facilitate code completion and infilling tasks. PPOCoder. PPOCoder [33] initially employs the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm [30] for code generations. In addition, it integrates dis- -----Task description----- def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:n \\"\\"\\"Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

We clean the APPS dataset [10] to provide a more rigorous evaluation and a foundation for training by RL in code generation. crete compiler feedback with syntax and semantics matching scores between generated code and executable objectives which reduces the sparsity of the reward function, thereby providing better guidance for generating code that aligns more closely with the correct objectives. RLTF. RLTF [20] features real-time data generation during the training process and multigranularity unit test feedback. Except for the discrete compiler feedback, it penalizes specific sections in the code where errors occur through the error locations from the feedback of unit tests. C The algorithm of CCCS and FGO The full algorithm of StepCoder is detailed in Algorithm 1. D The prompts used for code generation For DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8], we use the same prompt as the previous paper. Moreover, DeepSeekCoder-Instruct serves as the backbone model for PPOCoder [33], RLTF [20], and our proposed StepCoder. Consequently, we align the prompts for these RL-based approaches with the prompt of DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct to maintain consistency. The prompt used for other models such as CodeLlama, WizardCoder and StarCoder is the same as in previous studies [5; 23; 15; 27]. The prompt used for DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct and LLMs based on it is as follows: You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. # Instruction: write an algorithm in python: {Task description} # Response: Algorithm 1 StepCoder: Improve Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback Require: the train dataset D = {(xi , yi , ui , ei), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, the threshold value ρt for curriculum training.

Traditional RL methods struggle with exploration difficulties and ineffective optimization when dealing with the complex code generated by large language models (LLMs) due to the sparsity of compiler feedback. StepCoder addresses these challenges with two main components: 1. Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS): This component breaks down the long sequences of code generation into smaller, more manageable subtasks, making RL exploration more feasible. It starts with simple code completion tasks and progressively increases the complexity as the model becomes better at generating code. 2. Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO): This component optimizes the model by focusing only on the code segments that are executed during unit tests, effectively ignoring unexecuted code fragments to provide more accurate optimization signals.

Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests.

Recently, with the development of large language models (LLMs), techniques based on LLM [15; 37; 23] have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation. However, challenges persist in aligning these models with complex human requirements [2; 10; 27], indicating a gap that still exists in fully meeting user expectations. * Equal contributions. † Correspondence to: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, {rzhen g20, qz, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> In this context, learning from compiler feedback exhibits impressive potential to improve the comprehension of complicated human requirements and the quality of generated codes [14]. This feedback from compilation and execution results is instrumental in directly ascertaining the functional correctness of programs [17; 39]. Researchers [20; 33] introduce reinforcement learning (RL) and leverage compiler feedback from unit tests as a reward metric to guide the exploration of the output space of LLMs. The intention is for the policy model to favor actions that yield higher rewards increasingly. Nevertheless, the optimization of LLMs for code generation via RL presents several hurdles. First, the increasing complexity of human requirements often results in the generation of longer code sequences, which makes exploration struggle [9; 13]. Second, in cases where a single unit test fails to cover the complex code, unexecuted code snippets may emerge that are not relevant to the reward. Rendering optimization based on the entire code sequence is potentially imprecise. Additionally, our analysis reveals quality limitations in existing datasets like APPS [10] for RL training, which impedes accurate learning from compiler feedback through RL. To tackle these challenges, we first introduce StepCoder, an innovative framework developed for enhancing code generation through reinforcement learning. StepCoder integrates two key components: Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS) and Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO). CCCS is designed to alleviate the complexities associated with exploration in code generation, while FGO is designed to provide more precise and effective optimization strategies. Specifically, CCCS employs a step-by-step strategy to break down complex exploration problems (i.e., code generation) into a curriculum of easier sub-tasks (i.e., code completion). As the training progresses, the difficulty of code completion tasks rises by increasing arXiv:2402.01391v1 [cs.SE] 2 Feb 2024 the portion of code that needs to be completed. Eventually, the aim is for the model to evolve to a stage where it can effectively generate code solely from human requirements, thus fulfilling the original training goal of code generation. On the other hand, the key insight of FGO is that code snippets that are not executed in a unit test do not contribute to the final reward calculation. Therefore, FGO uses a dynamic masking technique to mask unexecuted snippets from unit test evaluations, ensuring that the model is optimized utilizing only the relevant code segments. Subsequently, our endeavor involves the development of APPS+, a dataset of superior quality specifically curated for code generation. APPS+ is meticulously designed to exclude code segments that exhibit syntax errors, are irrelevant to the stipulated problem, or fail to produce any output. Additionally, we have taken measures to standardize the format of inputs and outputs in unit tests to guarantee deterministic output comparisons. We evaluate the effectiveness of popular LLMs on APPS+. The results reveal that although LLMs show progressive improvements, they face difficulties with complex human requirements. We further evaluate our method on several extensively used benchmarks including MBPP [2] and HumanEval [3]. The experimental results show that StepCoder effectively eases the exploration difficulty in code generation, outperforming other reinforcement learning-based methods in effectiveness. The main contributions of our paper are as follows: • We introduce StepCoder, a novelty training method via RL, including CCCS and FGO. CCCS makes exploration easier by breaking down the complicated goals into subobjectives curriculum. FGO provides finegrained optimization by only utilizing the executed code in unit tests. • We constructed APPS+, a high-quality dataset designed for code generation. APPS+ provides a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities and a foundation to introduce reinforcement learning in the training phase. • Experiments show that StepCoder can improve the exploration efficiency and effectiveness and outperform other methods. import random def test(): ... for _ in range(int(input())): … rows[0] = p[::2] rows[1] = p[1::2] if sign(rows[0][0]) != sign(rows[1][0]): print(0) continue for r in range(2, max_rows): for n in range(max_col - 1): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][0] * rows[r - 2][n + 1] - rows[r - 2][0] * rows[r - 1][n + 1] last = sign(rows[0][0]) flag = 1 for i in range(1, len(rows)): curr = sign(rows[i][0]) if rows[r] == [0 for _ in range(max_col)]: for n in range(max_col): rows[r][n] = rows[r - 1][n] * (max_pow + 4 - (r + 1) - 2 * (n + 1)) elif rows[i][0] == 0: if any([x != 0 for x in rows[i]]): flag = 0 break else: curr = last if curr != last: flag = 0 break last = curr : conditional statement : executed code : unexecuted code Figure 1: The canonical solution of an instance in the APPS dataset. We collect the conditional statements by analyzing their abstract syntax tree, and some conditional statements are highlighted with a grey dashed box. When inputting s = [1n10 12 1 5 3n], only 75% of the code fragment is executed, highlighted with a green background. 2 Motivation In this section, we clearly illustrate the challenges faced by reinforcement learning in code generation using a simplified example from APPS [10], which was widely used for RL training in code generation. Exploration problems of RL in code generation. Exploration methods play a crucial role in tackling complicated sequence but sparse reward problems [43; 13]. When a policy model explores a trajectory with high returns, it undergoes optimization, making it inclined to take similar actions in the future [41; 28]. Consider the code shown in Figure 1, aimed at fulfilling a given human requirement. We first collect the conditional statements (CS) that are indicated by the dashed box by analyzing its abstract syntax tree. Conditional statement introduces new independent paths, increasing the complexity of the program [32]. Suppose Pθ(CSi) denotes the probability that the policy model with parameter θ completes the i-th conditional statement. The probability that the policy model correctly generates this code according to human requirements can be expressed as follows: P ∝ Po Y3 i=1 Pθ(CSi), (1) where Po is the probability of other code snippets except the code labeled in the figure. Typically, we initialize the policy model with the SFT model in sequence generation tasks to facilitate easier exploration [26; 45]. However, the limited performance of the SFT model in code generation still leads to the probability Pθ(CSi) at low values [33; 27]. The increasing complexity of human requirements in code generation tasks often leads to a corresponding rise in the number of conditional statements. This escalation can result in a substantial decrease in the probability Pθ(CSi), potentially leading P to an exponential reduction. Such a scenario exacerbates the challenges associated with exploration in large language models. An alternative approach to facilitate exploration is through reward shaping, a technique where designers artificially introduce rewards more frequently [13]. However, this method encounters a significant limitation in the context of our application. Specifically, in code generation tasks utilizing unit test feedback, rewards can only be obtained after the execution of the completely generated code. Consequently, the exploration of high-return trajectories in tasks with complex sequences and sparse rewards poses a significant challenge in optimizing the policy model. Optimization problems of RL in code generation. We first introduce the RL fine-tuning process in code generation. Formally, for a learned policy model πθ with parameter θ, we treat the prediction of each token as an action a taken by πθ according to the history token sequences. The history token sequences can be viewed as the state s. Given a human requirement x, we denote the solution code y generated by πθ as an episode, and r(x, y) is the reward function from the compiler based on compilation and execution. Updating the parameters of πθ by using gradient policy algorithm [35] can be represented as follows: max θ E(x,y)∼Dπθ [ X t A t π log(yt |y1:t−1, x; θ)] (2) where Aπ is the advantage computed by the Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) [29] from reward r, to reduce the variability of predictions. In code generation, rewards are contingent upon the correctness of the unit test sample, which is only relevant to the code snippet being executed. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, when the input to the function is [1n10 12 1 5 3n], 75% of the code fragment is executed, which is highlighted with a green dashed box. It indicates that some actions in the code are irrelevant to the reward, which leads to inaccurate advantage. Therefore, optimizing the policy model πθ with all actions is ineffective by using Equation 2. 3 Method In this section, we elaborate on the methodological details of StepCoder, which provide an easier exploration and fine-grained optimization for RL in code generation, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. 3.1 Priliminaries Suppose D = {(xi , yi , ui , ei)} N i=0 is the training dataset for code generation, which x, y, u denotes the human requirement (i.e., the task description), the canonical solution and the unit test samples, respectively. ei = {stj , enj} Ei j=0 is a list of conditional statements by automatically analyzing the abstract syntax tree of the canonical solution yi , which st and en represent the start position and the end position of the statements, respectively. e is sorted in ascending order based on the start position st. For a human requirement x, its canonical solution y can be represented as {at} T t=0. In code generation, given a human requirement x, the final states are the set of codes passing the unit tests u. 3.2 StepCoder StepCoder integrates two key components: CCCS and FGO. CCCS is designed to break the code generation tasks into a curriculum of the code completion subtasks. It can alleviate the exploration challenge in RL. FGO is specifically designed for code generation tasks to provide fine-grained optimization by computing only the loss of executed code snippets. CCCS. In code generation, the solution to a complicated human requirement usually involves a long action sequence taken by the policy model. Meanwhile, the feedback from the compiler is delayed and sparse, i.e., the policy model only receives the reward after generating the entire code. In this scenario, exploring is difficult. The core of our method is to break down such a long sequence of exploration problems into a curriculum of short, easily explorable sub-tasks. We simplify code generation to code completion sub-tasks. These sub-tasks Vanilla Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback StepCoder Step 1 Final . . . . . .

In code generation, the environment with sparse and delayed rewards and the complicated human requirement that involves a long sequence make exploration challenging for the Vanilla RL. In CCCS, we break down a complicated exploration problem into a curriculum of sub-tasks. Utilizing a portion of the canonical solution as the prompt enables the LLM to explore starting from simple sequences. The computation of rewards is only relevant for the executed code snippets, and it is imprecise to optimize the LLM with the entire code (i.e., ). In FGO, we mask unexecuted tokens (i.e., ) in unit tests and only compute the loss function using executed tokens (i.e., ) to provide a fine-grained optimization. are automatically constructed from the canonical solution in the training dataset. Consider a human requirement x, early in the training phase of CCCS, the starting point s ∗ of exploration is the states near the final states. Specifically, we provide the human requirement x and the front part of the canonical solution xp = {ai} s ∗ i=0, and the policy model is trained to complete the code based on x ′ = (x, xp). Let yˆ be the combined sequence of xp and the output trajectory τ , i.e. yˆ = (xp, τ ). The reward model provides the reward r according to the correctness of the code snippet τ with yˆ as input, where we use the same setting as previous approaches [14; 33] as follows: r(x ′ , yˆ) =    + 1, if yˆ passed all unit tests −0.3, if yˆ failed any unit test −0.6, if yˆ happened runtime error − 1, if yˆ happened compile error. (3) We use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [30] to optimize the policy model πθ by utilizing the reward r and the trajectory τ . In the optimization phase, the canonical solution’s code segment xp used for providing prompts is masked, such that it does not contribute to the gradient for the policy model πθ update. CCCS optimizes the policy model πθ by maximizing the objection function as follows: Objective(θ) = E(x ′ ,yˆ)∼Dπθ [r(x ′ , yˆ) − β log(πθ(ˆy|x ′ ))/πref(ˆy|x ′ )] (4) where π ref is the reference model in PPO, which is initialized by the SFT model. As the training progresses, the starting point s ∗ of exploration gradually moves towards the beginning of the canonical solution. Specifically, we set a threshold ρ for each training sample. Each time the cumulative correct proportion of code segments generated by πθ is greater than ρ, we move the starting point toward the beginning. In the later stages of training, the exploration of our method is equivalent to the exploration process of original reinforcement learning, i.e., s ∗ = 0, where the policy model generates code using only human requirements as input. The starting point s ∗ is sampled at the beginning position of the conditional statements to complete the remaining unwritten code segments. Specifically, a program with a greater number of conditional statements results in increased independent paths, leading to a higher logical complexity [32]. This complexity necessitates more frequent sampling to improve the quality of training, while programs with fewer conditional statements need less frequent sampling. This sampling method allows for a balanced and representative sampling of code structures, catering to both complex and simple semantic constructs in the training dataset. To accelerate the training phase, we set the i-th sample’s number of curricula equal to ⌈ √ Ei⌉, where Ei is its number of conditional statements. The i-th sample’s stride of the training curriculum is ⌈ Ei ⌈ √ Ei⌉ ⌉ instead of one. The key insight of CCCS can be summarized as follows: 1) It is easy to explore from the states near the goal (i.e., final states). 2) Exploring starting from the states distant from the goal is challenging, but it becomes easier when can leverage states that have already learned how to reach the goal. FGO. The relationship between reward and action in code generation differs from other reinforcement learning tasks such as Atari [25; 19]. In code generation, we can exclude a set of actions irrelevant to computing the rewards in generated code. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 2, for a unit test, the feedback from the compiler relates only to the code snippets being executed. However, in vanilla RL optimization objectives, as shown in Equation 4, all actions of the trajectory are engaged in the computation of the gradient used in the policy update, which is imprecise. To improve the precision of optimization, we mask actions (i.e., tokens) that are not executed in unit tests when computing the loss for updating the policy model. The full algorithm of CCCS and FGO is detailed in Algorithm 1. 4 Experiments In this section, we first introduce APPS+, a highquality dataset for code generation by manually verifying based on the APPS dataset. Then, we elaborate on the experiment details and the experimental results. 4.1 Dataset Preprocessing Reinforcement learning requires an amount of highquality training data. During our investigation, we found that among the currently available opensource datasets, only APPS meets this requirement. However, we found there are incorrect instances, such as missing input, output, or canonical solution, canonical solutions that were uncompileable or unexecutable, and discrepancies in execution output. To refine the APPS dataset, we excluded instances lacking input, output, or canonical solutions. Then, we standardized the formats of input and output to facilitate the execution and comparison of unit tests. We conducted unit tests and manual analysis for each instance, eliminating those with incomplete or irrelevant code, syntax errors, API misuse, or missing library dependencies. For discrepancies in output, we manually reviewed the problem description, correcting the expected output or eliminating the instance. Finally, we construct the APPS+ dataset, containing 7,456 instances. Each instance includes a programming problem description, a canonical solution, a function name, unit tests (i.e., inputs and outputs), and starter code (i.e., the beginning part of the canonical solution). Appendix A illustrates an example from APPS+. The top section of the figure shows the problem description, and the right section presents the canonical solution, unit tests, and metadata. Further details of APPS+ are discussed in Appendix B.1. 4.2 Experiment Details Benchmarks. In our study, we initially evaluated our method and baselines on our pre-processed APPS+ dataset. Moreover, we also evaluate these methods on several widely-used benchmarks in code generation, i.e., MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) [2] and HumanEval [3]. We evaluate the MBPP and HumanEval benchmark in a zero-shot learning setting which is the same as previous approaches [14; 33]. In this setting, we fine-tune the models only on the APPS+ dataset and evaluate the code generation performance on MBPP and HumanEval. The detailed description of benchmarks can be found in the Appendix B.1. Baselines. To verify the effectiveness of StepCoder and evaluate the performance of LLMs on our APPS+ dataset, we consider a wide range of baselines, including StarCoder [15], WizardCoder Models Size APPS+ Introductory Interview Competition Overall Base Models CodeLlama [27] 13B 18.7 11.0 0.0 13.0 CodeLlama-Python [27] 13B 29.0 12.3 2.9 17.9 DeepSeek-Coder-Base [8] 6.7B 13.0 10.3 5.0 10.9 Supervised Fine-tuned Models StarCoder [15] 15.6B 6.3 4.1 0.7 4.7 CodeLlama-Instruct [27] 13B 33.3 11.0 1.4 18.7 WizardCoder-Python-V1.0 [23] 13B 39.7 15.1 4.3 23.6 DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] 6.7B 49.4 18.7 3.6 29.2 SFT on APPS+ 6.7B 50.1 19.0 6.4 29.8 Reinforcement Learning-based Models (Using DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B as the backbone) Vanilla PPO 6.7B 53.7 20.1 5.0 31.7 PPOCoder [33] 6.7B 54.4 20.3 6.4 32.1 RLTF [20] 6.7B 55.1 20.8 6.4 32.7 StepCoder (Ours) 6.7B 59.7 23.5 8.6 36.1 w/o CCCS 6.7B 58.7 21.7 7.1 34.6 w/o FGO 6.7B 58.4 23.3 8.6 35.5 Table 1: Results of pass@1 on our proposed APPS+. We compare popular and widely used state-of-the-art methods with our method. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply these RL-based methods using the same base model (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B [8]) as a backbone on the APPS+ dataset. In addition, We conduct supervised fine-tuning using our APPS+ dataset based on DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B to further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our approach. [23], DeepSeek-Coder [8], and three versions of CodeLlama (Base, Python, Instruct) [27]. Moreover, we also consider vanilla PPO and two state-ofthe-art RL-based approaches, including PPOCoder [33] and RLTF [20]. We carried out experiments applying these methods utilizing the same backbone (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8]) on the APPS+ dataset to ensure a fair comparison. In addition to demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of our method, we also supervised finetuning DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct [8] on the APPS+ dataset to exclude the effect of training data. The detailed description of these baselines is discussed in Appendix B.2. Implementation Details. During the SFT phase, we adopt a learning rate set at 2e −5 , conduct training for three epochs, and employ a warm-up period of 0.3 epochs, with a linear decay to zero. The finetuning process was conducted on a device with eight NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs, with the global batch size set to 64. In the PPO training phase, we employ a learning rate of 5e −7 for the policy model and 1.5e −6 for the critic model. For each example, we collect a 16 roll-out code using nucleus sampling. The sampling temperature is set to 0.8, top-p is set to 0.9, and the maximum output token length is set to 1024. The token-level KL penalty coefficient β is set to 0.05, with a clip value of 0.8. In the decoding phase, the temperature and top_p are set to 0.2 and 0.95, respectively. Evaluation & Metric. We conduct the experiments based on Python3.x. Note that we also use Python3.x during the reward collection in RL-based methods. Following prior studies [27; 23; 14], we use Pass@k [3] metric to evaluate all the models. Pass@k quantifies the proportion of instances in which at least one of the k-generated code solutions per human requirement successfully passes all unit tests. The prompts used for code generation are listed in Appendix D. 4.3 Experimental Results on APPS+ To assess the performance of widely used LLMs and our StepCoder on code generation, we conduct experiments on the APPS+ dataset that we constructed. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 1. The results indicate that RL-based models outperform other language models, including both base models and SFT models. It is reasonable to infer that reinforcement learning can further enhance the quality of code generation by more effectively navigating the model’s output space, guided by compiler feedback. Furthermore, our StepCoder surpasses all baseline models including other RL-based approaches, achieving the highest score. Specifically, our approach obtains 59.7%, 23.5% and 8.6% in the ‘Introductory’, ‘Interview’ and ‘Competition’, respectively. Our approach excels in exploring the output space compared to other RL-based methods, achieved by simplifying complex code generation tasks to code completion sub-tasks. Additionally, the FGO process plays a pivotal role in precisely optimizing the policy model. We also found that the performance of StepCoder is better than LLM which supervised fine-tuning on the APPS+ dataset based on the same backbone. The latter did little to improve the pass rate of the generated code compared with the backbone. This also directly demonstrates that the method of using compiler feedback to optimize the model improves the quality of the generated code better than next-token prediction in code generation.

We evaluate the LLMs’ performance on code generation in a zero-shot learning setting. In this setting, the models are fine-tuned on our proposed APPS+ dataset and tested for their ability on MBPP and HumanEval. 4.4 Ablation Studies To investigate the impact of individual components in StepCoder, we conducted ablation experiments with two variations of our approach, including StepCoder only with CCCS and only with FGO. The experimental results are presented in Table 1. Experimental results demonstrate that both components of our approach improve the quality of the generated code compared to vanilla PPO. CCCS can enhance its performance in addressing Competition-level problems. This improvement is logical, considering that CCCS effectively simplifies the exploration of more complex human requirements. Simultaneously, FGO boosts the pass rate of unit tests by integrating compiler feedback with the relevant executed code snippet. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Fraction of lines duplicated 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Number of tasks with MBPP with HumanEval Figure 3: Analysis of duplicated lines between APPS+ and the two benchmarks. The overlap of data between APPS+ and them is very small. Only 0.2% and 7.1% had more than half of their lines matched somewhere in MBPP and HumanEval, respectively. 4.5 Results on MBPP and HumanEval To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted comparative analyses of StepCoder against various approaches using the well-recognized benchmarks MBPP and HumanEval. These models are trained on APPS+ and then evaluated on MBPP and HumanEval. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 2 which shows that StepCoder is superior over all other models on both benchmarks. However, there are concerns regarding potential overlaps in the training data between APPS+ and the two benchmarks, which might contribute to an improvement in performance. To address these concerns, we analyze the difference between APPS+ and the benchmarks by calculating the code line overlap ratio of two corresponding canonical solutions following previous work [2; 14]. The findings are presented in Figure 3. This evidence underscores our approach’s effectiveness in enhancing the quality of generated code and its capability across a broad spectrum of code generation tasks, primarily by improving the exploration problem in reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, our findings revealed a significant degradation in the performance of the SFT model on both MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks. Further analysis of the error cases showed that a minority were related to function name errors, while the majority were associated with program correctness errors. This also indicated that SFT on a single dataset may impair the ability to follow instructions and the ability to generalize, thus affecting the performance of code generation on other tasks. In contrast, RL-based methods can improve the performance for unseen tasks of code generation. 4.6 Analysis by Unit Test Results We further analyzed the results of cases that did not pass all unit tests, as shown in Figure 4. The results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the likelihood of compilation errors, which is particularly evident in Interview-level and Competition-level programming problems. However, it was also observed that all LLMs are more prone to runtime errors and failures as compared to compilation errors, albeit StepCoder shows a comparatively lower rate of runtime errors and failures. These results demonstrate that StepCoder is less prone to compilation errors, but still suffers from runtime errors and failure. Consequently, these findings suggest that future research should further concentrate on significantly reducing runtime errors, which could greatly enhance both the quality and the pass rate of the code generated by such models.

The results are categorized into CompileError (Reward = -1) and Runtimeerror & Failure (Reward = -0.6 or -0.3). 5 Related Work 5.1 Large Language Models for Code Generation Recently, LLMs have shown remarkable ability in understanding natural language and code generation by training on large text corpora containing code data. Several pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate significant potential for code generation including CodeGPT [21], PanGu-Coder [4], SantaCoder [1], CodeGeex [44] and Phi-1.5 [16]. In addition, SFT models achieve more competitive performance such as CodeX [3], StarCoder [15], WizardCoder [23], Code Llama Instruct [27], and DeepSeek-Coder [8]. Reinforcement Learning is a method of learning the optimal policy by exploring the environment and obtaining rewards [41; 34]. Recently, some researchers have introduced RL to LLMs and improved the quality of the generated code by utilizing the unit test feedback to explore the output space of the policy model [33; 20; 14]. For instance, CodeRL [14] leverages signal from unit tests as rewards and utilizes the actor-critic approach [12; 35] to enhance models on code generation. PPOCoder [33] refines CodeRL by employing the PPO algorithm [30] and RLTF [20] provides fine-grained rewards through the error locations, but the reward space is still sparse. However, the exploration of complex tasks in an environment characterized by a sparse reward is challenging. These methods still fall short of effectively using RL to enhance the model’s performance in code generation. 5.2 Exploration in Reinforcement Learning Exploration is crucial in addressing long sequences and sparse reward problems [9; 13]. In the sequence generation task, researchers improved exploration by initializing the policy model using the SFT model [26; 31]. Our proposed approach incorporates similar methods, but additional methods are necessary to ensure effective exploration. This is particularly evident when facing complex human requirements, where the limited quality of code generated by SFT models makes exploration still challenging [33]. Other notable methods introduce the ProcessSupervised Reward Model to provide step-by-step rewards for complex sequence generation tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation [38; 18; 22; 24]. However, these methods require labelling a large preference dataset to train the reward model. Similar to our approach, some methods construct a learning curriculum by initiating each episode from a sequence of progressively more challenging starting states [28; 11; 6]. In contrast to our approach, these methods are designed to address the problem of exploration in other fields, such as gaming and robotic manipulation. Meanwhile, our approach combines software engineering features to dynamically determine the starting states through conditional statements. We also introduce FGO to provide a fine-grained optimization for the policy model by leveraging the coverage information. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce StepCoder, a novelty training framework via RL. StepCoder breaks down complicated exploration problems to reduce the difficulty of exploring environments with sparse rewards while providing fine-grained optimization. In addition, we also construct a high-quality dataset APPS+, specifically for code generation. Experiments indicate that our method can effectively improve the quality of generated code via reinforcement learning compared to other approaches.","output":"The paper \\"StepCoder: Improve Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback\\" introduces a new framework, StepCoder, which aims to improve code generation by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with feedback from compilers. Traditional RL methods struggle with lengthy code sequences, and optimizing using unit tests can be ineffective due to unexecuted codes. StepCoder addresses these issues through two main components: 1. Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS): This strategy simplifies the RL exploration by breaking down a long code generation task into smaller, manageable subtasks. 2. Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO): It focuses on optimizing the model by considering only the executed code segments during unit tests, ensuring precise optimization. Additionally, the authors create a new dataset, APPS+, specifically designed for RL training in code generation. The dataset is manually verified to ensure the accuracy and coverage of unit tests. The experimental results demonstrate that StepCoder enhances the exploration of the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on relevant benchmarks. The key contributions of the paper include: - Introducing the StepCoder training method, which simplifies complex goals into a curriculum of sub-tasks while providing fine-grained optimization using executed code snippets during unit tests. - Creating the high-quality APPS+ dataset for RL training, providing a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs' capabilities. - Showing through experiments that StepCoder improves exploration efficiency and outperforms other methods in code generation. The paper emphasizes the importance of addressing exploration challenges in RL, specifically for code generation tasks, and provides a detailed explanation of the StepCoder framework along with comprehensive experiments to support its effectiveness."},{"instruction":"아이패드 프로는 몇세대 까지 나왔는가?","output":"제 지식이 2023년까지의 정보로 업데이트되어 있기 때문에, 그 시점까지 발표된 최신 아이패드 프로 세대는 2021년에 출시된 5세대 모델입니다. 이 모델에서는 M1 칩이 탑재되었고, 미니 LED 디스플레이가 적용된 12.9인치 버전도 포함되었습니다. 그러나 시간이 지나면 Apple은 새로운 세대의 아이패드 프로 모델을 출시할 수 있으므로, 가장 최신 정보를 확인하려면 Apple의 공식 웹사이트나 신뢰할 수 있는 뉴스 소스를 참조하시는 것이 좋습니다."},{"instruction":"아이패드 프로 6세대는 언제 출신했나요?","output":"제 지식이 2023년 초까지의 정보로 업데이트되어 있기 때문에, 그 시점까지는 아이패드 프로 6세대에 대한 공식 발표가 없었습니다. 따라서 6세대 아이패드 프로의 출시 날짜에 대해 알려드릴 수 있는 정보가 없습니다. 가장 최신 정보를 얻으려면 Apple의 공식 발표를 확인하거나 신뢰할 수 있는 뉴스 소스를 참조해야 합니다."},{"instruction":"M2칩으로 이루어진 아이패드를 아나요?","output":"제 지식이 2023년 초까지의 정보로 업데이트되어 있기 때문에, 그 시점까지는 M2 칩을 탑재한 아이패드에 대한 공식 발표가 없었습니다.

In quella data gli italiani furono chiamati alle urne per decidere la forma di governo del Paese dopo la caduta del fascismo e la fine della Seconda Guerra Mondiale. La scelta tra la monarchia e la repubblica fu vinta da quest'ultima con una percentuale di circa il 54%. In seguito a questo esito, il 18 giugno 1946, il re Umberto II di Savoia lasciò l'Italia, ponendo fine a circa 85 anni di regno della Casa Savoia. Il 2 giugno, giornata del referedum, è oggi festeggiato come la Festa della Repubblica Italiana."},{"instruction":"Quale era l'esercito più potente della seconda guerra mondiale?","output":"La domanda su quale fosse l'esercito più potente durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale può avere risposte diverse, a seconda di come si misura la \\"potenza\\" e in quale fase del conflitto ci si riferisce. All'inizio della guerra, la Germania nazista era considerata dagli storici essere la più potente, grazie alla sua ben addestrata Wehrmacht, alla sua dottrina militare innovativa basata sulla guerra lampo (Blitzkrieg), alla superiorità della sua tecnologia militare in termini di carri armati e aerei, e alla capacità di coordinare operazioni combinate tra forze terrestri, aeree e navali con grande efficacia. Tuttavia, man mano che la guerra avanzava, la situazione cambiò drasticamente, soprattutto a seguito dell'ingresso in guerra degli Stati Uniti e dell'Unione Sovietica. L'Unione Sovietica, nonostante le enormi perdite iniziali, divenne uno degli eserciti più numerosi e potenti, ribaltando la situazione sul fronte orientale con battaglie come quella di Stalingrado e la successiva offensiva che riprese gran parte dei territori occupati dai nazisti, culminando nella presa di Berlino nel 1945. Gli Stati Uniti, dal canto loro, possono essere considerati la forza militare più potente verso la fine del conflitto, grazie alla loro enorme capacità produttiva (il cosiddetto \\"Arsenale della Democrazia\\"), alla loro superiorità tecnologica (come dimostrato dallo sviluppo della bomba atomica) e alla loro capacità di proiettare la forza su vasta scala sia nel teatro europeo sia in quello del Pacifico, affrontando l'Impero del Giappone. Nel complesso, la seconda metà della guerra vide il prevalere degli Alleati, che potevano contare su maggiori risorse umane e materiali, su una maggiore capacità produttiva e su una cooperazione multinazionale efficace contro l'Asse. Tuttavia, l'identificazione dell'esercito \\"più potente\\" può variare in base a numerosi fattori, inclusi periodo specifico, teatro di guerra e tipo di confronto militare."},{"instruction":"Attualmente quale è l'esercito più potente del mondo, fai una classifica","output":"Valutare l'esercito più potente del mondo può essere una questione complessa poiché dipende da molteplici fattori come la dimensione, la tecnologia, il budget, la formazione, la dottrina militare, e le capacità strategiche e tattiche. Tuttavia, basandosi su varie analisi e fonti pubbliche disponibili, una classifica generale (considerando i vari aspetti come la forza di combattimento convenzionale, il potenziale nucleare, la logistica, e la portata globale) potrebbe essere la seguente: 1. **Stati Uniti**: L'esercito degli Stati Uniti è generalmente considerato il più potente al mondo, con un budget difensivo significativamente più grande di qualsiasi altro paese, una tecnologia avanzata, una rete globale di basi militari e una notevole capacità di proiezione della forza. 2. **Russia**: Nonostante il budget militare minore rispetto agli Stati Uniti, la Russia detiene un vasto arsenale nucleare e mantiene forze armate considerevoli e tecnologicamente avanzate, con esperienze recenti in conflitti reali. 3. **Cina**: Il rapido modernizzamento e l'espansione delle capacità militari cinesi, combinato con un imponente potenziale industriale e tecnologico, rendono la Cina una delle potenze militari più importanti al mondo. 4. **India**: L'India ha una delle forze armate più grandi del mondo e continua ad espandere e modernizzare il suo arsenale militare, incluso il suo deterrente nucleare. 5. **Regno Unito**: Il Regno Unito mantiene forze armate di alta qualità e professionali, con una capacità nucleare strategica e una rete di alleanze globali, in particolare attraverso la NATO. 6. **Francia**: La Francia possiede un efficace deterrente nucleare e forze armate ben addestrate e dotate di moderne tecnologie militari. 7. **Giappone**: Sebbene la costituzione del Giappone limiti la sua forza militare a una capacità di autodifesa, il paese detiene una delle marine militari più avanzate e meglio equipaggiate dell'Asia. 8. **Corea del Sud**: La Corea del Sud mantiene una delle forze armate più grandi e avanzate tecnologicamente nell'Asia orientale, soprattutto in risposta alla continua minaccia rappresentata dalla vicina Corea del Nord. 9. **Germania**: La Germania gioca un ruolo chiave nella difesa europea attraverso la NATO e sta cercando di aumentare la sua spesa militare e aggiornare il suo arsenale. 10. **Turchia o Brasile**: Entrambi i paesi possiedono forze armate significative nella loro regione, con un crescente focus sul miglioramento delle loro capacità militari. È essenziale notare che queste valutazioni possono variare, e nuove dinamiche globali possono influenzare la forza relativa degli eserciti.

Le Forze Armate italiane consistono in tre principali rami: l'Esercito Italiano, la Marina Militare e l'Aeronautica Militare, oltre ai Carabinieri che hanno funzioni di polizia militare e di sicurezza. Il settore della difesa italiano è impegnato nel processo di modernizzazione delle sue capacità, compreso l'acquisto di nuovi sistemi d'arma, veicoli e navi, e la partecipazione a progetti di cooperazione internazionale, come il programma di cacciabombardiere F-35. L'Italia investe nella difesa una percentuale del PIL che è generalmente inferiore rispetto a quella di altri grandi paesi membri della NATO, ma continua a essere influente a livello internazionale grazie alla sua posizione geopolitica nel Mediterraneo e alla partecipazione in organizzazioni internazionali e missioni di pace. Nelle varie classifiche riguardo alla potenza militare, l'Italia si posiziona solitamente attorno alla metà o alla ventesima posizione a livello mondiale, considerando diversi fattori quali capacità difensive, contributo alle alleanze internazionali, budget difensivo, disponibilità di personale e equipaggiamento militare."},{"instruction":"Quale è il miglior team militare specializzato al mondo?

Le informazioni sui servizi di intelligence sono per natura segrete e la valutazione delle capacità di un'agenzia di spionaggio può essere basata principalmente su congetture, informazioni desecretate e analisi di esperti. Non esiste una classifica ufficiale, poiché l'efficacia di un servizio segreto spesso risiede proprio nella sua capacità di operare nell'ombra. Tuttavia, sulla base della notorietà, storia, budget, rilevanza geopolitica e presunto impatto globale, alcuni dei servizi segreti che generalmente vengono considerati tra i più potenti includono: 1. **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - USA** La CIA è l'agenzia di intelligence civile principale degli Stati Uniti, con un vasto budget e una significativa portata globale. 2. **Federal Security Service (FSB) - Russia** Successore del KGB, il FSB è la principale agenzia di sicurezza interna della Russia e si occupa anche di operazioni di intelligence all'estero. 3. **Ministry of State Security (MSS) - Cina** Il MSS è responsabile dell'intelligence, della sicurezza e della controspionaggio, con una crescente influenza data dall'ascesa globale della Cina. 4. **MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service) - Regno Unito** Famoso per la sua storia e il suo ruolo durante la guerra fredda, MI6 è l'agenzia di intelligence estera del Regno Unito. 5. **Mossad - Israele** Il Mossad è noto per le sue operazioni di intelligence estera e azioni dirette, incluso il controterrorismo e la protezione degli interessi nazionali israeliani. 6. **Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure (DGSE) - Francia** L'equivalente francese della CIA, il DGSE svolge operazioni di intelligence all'estero per proteggere gli interessi nazionali francesi. 7. **Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) - Germania** Il BND è l'agenzia di intelligence estera della Germania, con ruoli sia nella raccolta di informazioni che nel controspionaggio. 8. **Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) - Pakistan** L'ISI è la principale agenzia di intelligence del Pakistan e ha una notevole influenza nella politica e nella sicurezza del Sud Asia. 9. **Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) - India** Il RAW è l'agenzia di intelligence principale per le operazioni estere dell'India e svolge un ruolo significativo nella regione del subcontinente indiano. 10. **American National Security Agency (NSA) - USA** Anche se si concentra principalmente sulla signals intelligence (SIGINT) e sulla sicurezza delle informazioni, l'influenza della NSA è tale da renderla uno dei principali attori nell'intelligence a livello mondiale. Queste agenzie operano generalmente al di fuori della vista del pubblico, e la loro efficacia si basa su una serie di fattori che sono difficili da misurare. Inoltre, vi sono molte altre agenzie di intelligence che giocano ruoli cruciali per la sicurezza dei loro rispettivi paesi e regioni.

In 2009, General Motors (GM) faced significant challenges. The automotive industry crisis of 2008-2010 led to financial struggles for GM, including a government bailout and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. During this period, GM was criticized for various issues, including the design, quality, and reliability of its vehicles. With this in mind, let’s conjure some satirical division slogans that reflect this period: 1. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet - Moving Forward... Until the Ignition Switch Fails.\\" - Meaning: At a time when automobile technology was progressing, Chevrolet faced a massive recall over faulty ignition switches that could unexpectedly turn off the engine, leading to loss of power and disabling of safety systems. 2. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac - Because Who Needs a Retirement Fund When You Can Have a CTS?\\" - Meaning: This slogan pokes fun at Cadillac's historically higher-priced luxury vehicles that were symbolically out of reach for many Americans facing financial uncertainty during the recession. 3. Buick: \\"Buick: Our Cars are as Young at Heart as Our Average Driver.\\" - Meaning: Buick vehicles were often perceived as appealing to an older demographic; this slogan plays on the contrast between trying to design modern cars while still being associated with an older clientele. 4. GMC: \\"GMC - Professional Grade Bailouts for Professional Grade Trucks.\\" - Meaning: GMC's \\"Professional Grade\\" slogan meets the reality of the times, as the company was among those receiving a government bailout to manage its financial crisis. 5. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac - Driving Excitement to the Graveyard.\\" - Meaning: Pontiac, once known for producing exciting sports cars like the GTO, was discontinued in 2010 following the financial troubles of GM. The slogan marks the end of its era with dark humor. 6. Hummer: \\"Hummer - Because Nothing Says 'Economic Downturn' Like a 10-MPG Tank.\\" - Meaning: In an economy struggling with high fuel prices and shifting to more fuel-efficient cars, the Hummer brand with its gas-guzzling vehicles represented a stark contrast to the trend. 7. Saturn: \\"Saturn - A Different Kind of Car Company, Now Indistinguishably Bankrupt.\\" - Meaning: Saturn was marketed as GM's \\"different\\" brand with a unique sales approach and \\"no-haggle\\" pricing. The sarcastic slogan notes that despite their attempt to stand out, they shared the same fate as much of the auto industry during the financial crisis. Please remember, this exercise is an attempt at humor and reflects the time-specific challenges General Motors faced. Since then, GM has restructured and refocused its efforts on innovation, quality, and sustainability, introducing electric vehicles and new technologies in its current lineup."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2004 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 2004, General Motors (GM) was still riding the wave of SUV popularity and grappling with an evolving automotive market that increasingly valued fuel efficiency, style, and technological innovation. At this time, GM divisions produced a multifaceted lineup, from trucks and large SUVs to sedans and sports cars, with varying degrees of success in design and market appeal. Bearing in mind the era's vehicle design themes, here are some satirical division slogans: 1. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: American Revolution - One Small Block at a Time.\\" - Meaning: Playing upon Chevrolet's \\"American Revolution\\" campaign, this slogan satirically suggests that their idea of innovation was incremental updates to their already famous small-block V8 engine, rather than radical redesigns or advanced technologies. 2. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac - Escalading Your Fuel Bills Since 1999.\\" - Meaning: Cadillac's Escalade became symbolic of luxury SUV excess, with considerable size and fuel consumption that, satirically, 'escalate' one’s gasoline expenditures. 3. Buick: \\"Buick - Not Old, Just Chronologically Superior.\\" - Meaning: Buick's reputation for catering to a more senior demographic is cheekily twisted into a feature, suggesting their designs are timelessly superior rather than simply outdated. 4. GMC: \\"GMC - Because 'Professional Grade' Means 'Needs a Professional Driver'.\\" - Meaning: GMC trucks and SUVs were often so large and powerful that it implied an average driver might need professional skills to handle them. 5. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac - Powering Plastic Fantastics Near You.\\" - Meaning: During this time, some Pontiac models were criticized for extensive use of plastic in interiors and cladding on exteriors, giving them a less-than-premium feel despite sporty pretensions. 6. Hummer: \\"Hummer - Go Anywhere, Park Nowhere.\\" - Meaning: Hummer vehicles could tackle tough off-road conditions but their large size and poor fuel economy made them less practical for everyday use, particularly in urban environments with limited parking. 7. Saturn: \\"Saturn - Re-thinking What It Means to Be American, One Plastic Body Panel at a Time.\\" - Meaning: Saturn vehicles featured dent-resistant plastic body panels, presented here as a defining trait of the brand that was supposedly rethinking American automotive norms. Again, this is all meant in good spirits and with the lens of satire. General Motors indeed wrestled with these public perceptions yet also endeavored to make many positive strides in design and technology during this period. These imagined slogans represent a playful take on the challenges of their designs from that era."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 2001 And Their Meaning?","output":"During the early 2000s, American car companies often faced criticism over the quality and reliability of their vehicles compared to their Japanese or European counterparts. Building upon that theme, here are some satirical slogans based on the public perception of American car quality in 2001: 1. Ford: \\"Ford: Built Tough, Repaired Often.\\" - Meaning: A twist on Ford's classic \\"Built Ford Tough\\" slogan, this version pokes fun at the perception that Ford vehicles, despite their rugged image, frequently required repairs and maintenance. 2. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: Like a Rock, Sometimes Won't Roll.\\" - Meaning: This plays off Chevy's slogan \\"Like a Rock,\\" implying that their reliability was so solid it occasionally wouldn't even start or move, much like a stationary rock. 3. Chrysler: \\"Chrysler: Inspiration Comes Standard, Durability Sold Separately.\\" - Meaning: While Chrysler aimed to position itself as an innovative and stylish brand, this slogan insinuates that despite aesthetic appeal, the durability and longevity of the vehicles might not match the inspiration behind their designs. 4. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: Breaking Down Barriers (and Occasionally, Engines).\\" - Meaning: Cadillac sought to position itself as a luxury brand that challenged conventions, but the satirical slogan suggests it also had a knack for experiencing technical issues, like engine problems. 5. Dodge: \\"Dodge: Grab Life By The Horns, Tow Truck Not Included.\\" - Meaning: Derived from Dodge's actual slogan, \\"Grab Life by the Horns,\\" this version satirizes the notion that while their vehicles encouraged an adventurous spirit, you might need a tow truck for when adventures turned into misadventures. 6. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: Driving Excitement Until it Stops Excitingly.\\" - Meaning: Pontiac branded itself with \\"Driving Excitement,\\" but the satirical slogan hints at unreliability leading to unexpected and 'exciting' breakdowns. 7. Hummer: \\"Hummer: When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Are Thirsty.\\" - Meaning: Drawing on the Hummer's reputation for poor fuel economy, this slogan lampoons the idea that although Hummers are capable off-road vehicles, they consumed gas at an alarming rate. 8. Lincoln: \\"Lincoln: What a Luxury Car Should Be... Until the Warranty Expires.\\" - Meaning: Lincoln, as a purveyor of luxury cars, promises an ideal driving experience; however, this quip insinuates that problems tend to arise just as warranties end. These slogans employ humor to make light of some of the criticisms leveled against American car companies around the turn of the millennium, relating to vehicle reliability and quality concerns. Of course, since then, these companies have made substantial efforts to address these issues and improve the quality and image of their vehicles."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motor Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2003 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 2003, General Motors (GM) was still grappling with design strategies during a time when the auto industry had yet to fully embrace the incoming demand for more fuel-efficient and dynamically styled vehicles. Satirical slogans from this era might reflect the public's critique of vehicle design, perceived lack of innovation, or shortcomings in overall appeal. Here are some humorous and satirical takes on division slogans for GM in the year 2003: 1. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: America's Highway - Lined with Service Checks.\\" - Meaning: While Chevy aimed to put America on wheels, this slogan insinuates that frequent maintenance and service checks were a common part of the Chevrolet ownership experience. 2. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: Boldly Designed, Elderly Approved.\\" - Meaning: Cadillac's designs at the time were modernizing, but the brand still carried a reputation for appealing to an older demographic—this slogan pokes fun at that notion. 3. Buick: \\"Buick: Dreamed Up in the Past, Delivered to Your Present.\\" - Meaning: This slogan playfully suggests that Buick's design philosophy was seemingly trapped in yesteryear, despite being sold to contemporary drivers. 4. GMC: \\"GMC: Because When You Say 'Professional Grade,' You Mean 'Gas Tank Upgrade.'\\" - Meaning: GMC's vehicles, particularly their trucks and SUVs, were known for their large size and fuel consumption, necessitating a 'professional grade' fuel budget. 5. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: We Build Excitement, and Sometimes, We Even Include the Horsepower.\\" - Meaning: Although Pontiac's motto was \\"We Build Excitement,\\" not all models lived up to the performance expectations set by their sporty branding. 6. Saturn: \\"Saturn: A Different Kind of Company, A Different Kind of Compromise.\\" - Meaning: Saturn touted itself as an unconventional car brand, but this slogan hints that despite aiming to be different, compromises were still part of the package. 7. Hummer: \\"Hummer: Conquer the Wilderness, Consume the Resources.\\" - Meaning: Hummers were billed as rugged, all-terrain vehicles, yet the slogan satirically points out their notoriously poor fuel economy during an era when environmental concerns were growing. 8. Oldsmobile: \\"Oldsmobile: Not Your Father's Car Anymore—Literally.\\" - Meaning: A spin on the \\"Not Your Father's Oldsmobile\\" campaign intended to rebrand the image of Oldsmobile, this reflects the fact that by 2004, GM had decided to phase out the Oldsmobile brand. These fictitious slogans are shaped with a humorous lens, intended to entertain and nostalgically look back on the automaker's challenges of that period. They underscore the dynamic nature of the auto industry and the evolving expectations of the car-buying public. Since then, GM and its divisions have undergone extensive revitalization efforts and now focus on innovation, technology integration, and sustainability."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1996 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 1996, the automotive industry and General Motors (GM) were facing a mix of design challenges and marketplace perceptions, which would provide ample material for satirical slogan-making. Critics often pointed to the rising competition from foreign automakers, who were perceived as offering more innovative and reliable vehicles. Additionally, some of GM's designs were seen as behind the times or lacking the quality of their overseas competitors. Here are some tongue-in-cheek, satirical slogans for GM divisions during that year, along with explanations for the humor: 1. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: Building a Car for Every Purse and Purpose, and Every Mechanic Too.\\" - Meaning: Playing off a famous quote by GM's Alfred P. Sloan Jr., this slogan jabs at the reliability issues of some Chevy models, suggesting they kept mechanics in regular business. 2. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: When You're Too Old School for Old School.\\" - Meaning: Cadillac, once the epitome of American luxury, had a reputation for appealing to an older demographic resistant to change and mired in yesteryear's styling cues. 3. Buick: \\"Buick: Float On a Cloud, Steer Like One Too.\\" - Meaning: Buick's smooth ride was legendary, but in jest, this slogan hints at the floaty, imprecise driving dynamics that were sometimes ascribed to its larger models. 4. GMC: \\"GMC: Because Roads Are Just Suggestions Anyway.\\" - Meaning: GMC's trucks and SUVs were touted for their ruggedness, suggesting a tongue-in-cheek overconfidence in their off-road capabilities, even where unnecessary. 5. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: We are Driving Excitement, and Someday We'll Find the Map.\\" - Meaning: A playful take on Pontiac's old slogan \\"We build excitement,\\" the new slogan quips that while Pontiac claimed to be all about thrilling rides, finding the right direction in design was another matter. 6. Saturn: \\"Saturn: A Different Kind of Company, a Different Kind of Plastic.\\" - Meaning: Saturn was marketed for its unique business model and use of dent-resistant polymer panels. The satirical slogan pokes fun at the extensive use of plastic body parts, which some saw as less premium. 7. Oldsmobile: \\"Oldsmobile: Not Your Father's Car Because Even He Gave Up on It.\\" - Meaning: Referencing the classic campaign, \\"This is not your father's Oldsmobile,\\" aimed at rebranding the division to attract younger buyers, the slogan humorously indicates that even the older generation might have moved on to other brands. 8. Chevrolet Corvette: \\"Corvette: American Muscle, World-Class Plastic Surgery.\\" - Meaning: While the Corvette provided American sports car muscle, critics often noted the extensive use of plastics in the interiors that contrasted with the performance aspects of the car. Remember that these satirical slogans are all in good fun, playing on the perceptions of the era. Despite such perceptions, GM had been making strides to improve its vehicles and by the late 1990s, was beginning to place a greater emphasis on quality and design that would grow in the years to come."},{"instruction":"What are FOUR possible signs that a person could be an insider risk? which of the following is the correct answer Select one or more: Sudden unexplained increases in personal wealth Taking an increased interest in security procedures Their family or friends also work for the company Increased knowledge of politics and current affairs Applying for different job roles internally Drastic change in behaviour or political views Repeatedly trying to gain access to areas where they are not permitted","output":"Among the options provided, four possible signs that could indicate a person may be an insider risk are: 1.

Keep in mind, these slogans are purely satirical and fictional: 1. **Paramount Pictures:** \\"We Put the 'Mount' in Paramount – Climbing the Box Office Peaks with Every Release (And occasionally sliding back down...).\\" *Meaning:* Satirically noting Paramount's ambition to top the box office, with varying degrees of success. 2. **Warner Bros.:** \\"Where Every Film Is a High-Budget Gamble – Bros Before Shows!\\" *Meaning:* A poke at Warner Bros.' willingness to invest heavily in their films, sometimes prioritizing the brand over the content. 3. **20th Century Fox:** \\"In the Future, Everyone Will Remember Our Logo for 20 Seconds – Right Before the Main Feature They Actually Came to See.\\" *Meaning:* References the iconic nature of the Fox fanfare and logo, which are often more memorable than some of their film releases. 4. **Universal Pictures:** \\"Universal – When You're On the Lot, Every Movie Feels Like Jaws... Except When They Don't.\\" *Meaning:* Playing on the success of \\"Jaws\\" (1975), suggesting that while Universal struck gold with that film, their other productions might not always measure up. 5. **Columbia Pictures:** \\"Columbia: Lighting the Torch for Innovation... Or at Least Until the Wind of Blockbusters Blows It Out.\\" *Meaning:* Implies that Columbia's ambition to innovate could be overshadowed by the industry's shifting focus to blockbuster films. 6. **MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer):** \\"MGM – Where the Lion's Roar is Sometimes Louder Than the Applause.\\" *Meaning:* Suggests that while MGM's branding is instantly recognizable and impressive, their films don't always receive critical acclaim. 7. **Walt Disney Productions:** \\"Disney – Making Childhood Memories and Monopolizing Them One Animated Film at a Time.\\" *Meaning:* A humorous observation on Disney's role in creating films that become an integral part of childhood, hinting at their market dominance in family and animated features. 8. **United Artists:** \\"UA – United We Stand, Divided We... Wait, Who Left the Lights On?\\" *Meaning:* Refers to United Artists' historical significance and its later struggles with maintaining a solid footing in an evolving industry.

De plus, bien que certaines AIs puissent générer du contenu inspiré de Dragon Ball, comme des réseaux GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) pour les visuels ou des modèles de traitement du langage naturel pour le texte, ces systèmes ne possèdent pas encore la pleine compréhension et la polyvalence qu'une AGI promet théoriquement d'offrir."},{"instruction":"Il pourrait mettre un système de puissance","output":"Oui, l'intégration d'un système de puissance est une composante essentielle pour tout contenu généré procéduralement inspiré de l'univers de \\"Dragon Ball\\", étant donné que les niveaux de puissance sont un élément clé de la série. Voici comment une AI pourrait théoriquement procéder : 1. **Analyse des Systèmes Existant** : L'AI devrait d'abord apprendre les systèmes de puissance existants dans \\"Dragon Ball\\", y compris la progression des forces des personnages, comment les pouvoirs évoluent, et les différentes échelles de puissance comme les niveaux Super Saiyan. 2. **Création des Règles** : À partir de cette analyse, l'AI pourrait générer un ensemble de rulesets pour le système de puissance, en s'assurant qu'il respecte la logique et la continuité de l'univers \\"Dragon Ball\\". Il s’agirait de définir comment les personnages gagnent en force, les limites de leurs pouvoirs, et quels entraînements ou expériences pourraient entraîner une augmentation de puissance. 3. **Génération de Personnages** : En créant des personnages, l'AI pourrait attribuer des niveaux de puissance initiaux et prévoir des trajectoires de progression en fonction de leurs actions et expériences dans les histoires générées. 4. **Simulation de Combats** : Lorsque des scénarios de combat sont créés, l'AI pourrait utiliser le système de puissance pour déterminer les résultats de manière cohérente. Elle pourrait simuler des combats en tenant compte des niveaux de puissance relatifs, des stratégies et des techniques de combat spécifiques. 5. **Création de Contenu Dynamique** : L'AI serait capable d'ajuster le contenu des histoires en fonction des changements dans les niveaux de puissance des personnages, leur permettant d'affronter des défis nouveaux et plus grands, ce qui est un thème récurrent dans \\"Dragon Ball\\". 6. **Interaction Utilisateur** : Si le système est conçu pour un jeu vidéo ou une application interactive, il pourrait également intégrer les actions de l'utilisateur pour influer sur le système de puissance, permettant une expérience personnalisée où les décisions et les performances de l'utilisateur conduisent à des augmentations de puissance. En pratique, ces fonctionnalités dépassent largement les capacités des systèmes d'AI disponibles jusqu'en 2023. Aujourd'hui, de telles tâches nécessiteraient une combinaison de génération procédurale algorithmique, d'apprentissage machine et d'une programmation détaillée par des humains pour capturer avec succès la complexité et le charme de l'univers \\"Dragon Ball\\".

Then, branch out to explore the sub-causes and effects of each main cause.","output":"Analyzing the factors contributing to a pleasant work environment involves a comprehensive look at various elements that can affect employee satisfaction, productivity, and well-being. Here's a structured approach to analyze the main causes and their sub-causes and effects: **1. Workspace:** - **Sub-causes:** - Ergonomics: Furniture and accessories designed to prevent strain or injury. - Personal space: Adequate room for each employee to move and work comfortably. - Privacy: Ability to work without excessive interruption or oversight. - **Effects:** - Improved comfort leading to longer focus periods. - Reduced physical strain and associated health problems. - Enhanced sense of personal control over work environment. **2. Lighting:** - **Sub-causes:** - Natural light: Windows or skylights that allow daylight to enter. - Quality of artificial lighting: Appropriate illumination levels, minimization of glare and flicker. - Lighting adjustability: Ability for workers to control light levels in their area. - **Effects:** - Increased alertness and improved mood from natural light exposure. - Reduced eye strain and headaches with proper artificial lighting. - Greater satisfaction from the ability to customize one's lighting preferences. **3. Room Layout:** - **Sub-causes:** - Traffic flow: How people move through the space without crowding or interruptions. - Proximity of resources: Access to printers, copiers, files, and other frequently used tools. - Collaboration spaces: Areas designed for group work or informal meetings. - **Effects:** - Efficient movement and reduced time wastage. - Faster access to necessary resources, leading to increased productivity. - Improved teamwork and communication in properly designed collaboration areas. **4. Additional Factors to Consider:** - **Noise Level:** - Acoustic design, soundproofing, and policies around noise levels can impact concentration and stress levels. - **Air Quality and Temperature:** - Ventilation, heating, and air conditioning affect comfort and may influence health and alertness. - **Aesthetics and Design:** - Color schemes, artwork, and overall design contribute to the ambiance and can affect mood and creativity. - **Technology and Equipment:** - Provision of up-to-date, functional equipment reduces frustrations and downtimes. - **Culture and Social Factors:** - A culture that promotes mutual respect, support, and positive relationships can greatly enhance workplace satisfaction. - **Amenities and Perks:** - Break rooms, refreshments, fitness centers, and other facilities contribute to a comfortable environment. - **Management and Policies:** - Leadership styles, recognition programs, and policies around work-life balance can greatly influence the workplace atmosphere. By meticulously examining each of these aspects and their sub-causes, you can develop a well-rounded understanding of what constitutes a pleasant work environment and devise strategies to enhance it effectively. Note that due to the subjective nature of 'pleasantness,' feedback from employees is invaluable in identifying what works well and what needs improvement in their specific work environment."},{"instruction":"From each of the points above, give me what steps I can take and provide examples in the form of pictures, and what temperature of LED light is needed?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly provide pictures or specific product recommendations. However, I can guide you on the steps to take and describe examples for each point: **Workspace:** - Steps to Take: - Invest in adjustable chairs and desks to cater to different employee sizes and preferences. - Set up individual workstations to ensure space between employees, offering each enough room to work comfortably. - Install partitions or allow for enclosed spaces to provide privacy when needed. - Examples: Pictures of modern offices often show ergonomic chair designs, sit-stand desks, and partitioned cubicles. **Lighting:** - Steps to Take: - Maximize natural light by designing open spaces with large windows. - Use LED bulbs with a color temperature range between 4000K to 5000K for bright, neutral white light that is conducive to productivity and mimics daylight. - Install dimmer switches or provide desk lamps so employees can adjust their lighting levels. - Examples: Interior design magazines may feature offices with large windows, skylights, and lighting systems with various brightness settings. **Room Layout:** - Steps to Take: - Analyze foot traffic and arrange furniture to create clear paths for movement. - Place communal resources like printers in easily accessible central locations. - Create designated areas for collaboration fitted with whiteboards, seating, and presentation equipment. - Examples: Floor plans or photographs from contemporary workspaces show open-plan designs with central hubs for equipment and designated meeting areas. **Additional Steps to Consider:** - **Noise Level:** - Use sound-absorbing materials such as carpeting, acoustic panels, or plants. - Establish 'quiet zones' or implement noise guidelines during certain hours. - **Air Quality and Temperature:** - Ensure proper HVAC systems are in place and maintained for adequate ventilation. - Set thermostats to maintain a comfortable temperature, typically around 68-72°F (20-22°C). - **Aesthetics and Design:** - Choose a color scheme that reflects your company's brand and culture. - Enliven the space with art or natural elements like plants. - **Technology and Equipment:** - Regularly upgrade hardware and software to the latest standards. - Provide proper training and IT support to minimize technical disruptions. - **Culture and Social Factors:** - Facilitate team-building activities and social events. - Encourage open communication channels and recognize employee accomplishments. - **Amenities and Perks:** - Develop a well-equipped break room with comfortable seating and complimentary refreshments. - Offer on-site facilities such as a gym or relaxation spaces. - **Management and Policies:** - Implement flexible scheduling and remote work options where feasible. - Develop a clear structure for feedback and suggestions from employees. For specific examples of furniture, layout, and design, you can refer to online resources such as office furniture retailers, architectural magazines, or design websites where you will find visual examples and inspiration.

Now, let's define the Reagent component with the same series and options structure, for readability only the first chart is fully defined: \`\`\`clojure (ns your-ns-name (:require [reagent.core :as r] [\\"react-apexcharts\\" :refer [ReactApexChart]])) ;; Assume sparklineData is defined earlier or imported (defn apex-chart-component [] (let [series (r/atom [{:data (randomize-array sparklineData)}]) options (r/atom {:chart {:type \\"area\\" :height 160 :sparkline {:enabled true}} :stroke {:curve \\"straight\\"} :fill {:opacity 0.3} :yaxis {:min 0} :colors [\\"#DCE6EC\\"] :title {:text \\"424,652\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"24px\\"}} :subtitle {:text \\"Sales\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"14px\\"}}}) ; Repeat for other series and options as needed series2 ... options2 ... ; ... ] (fn [] ;; This function will be called on each re-render [:div [:div [:> ReactApexChart {:options @options :series @series :type \\"area\\" :height 160}]] ;; Repeat for other charts ;; ... ]))) \`\`\` Because Reagent components are just functions, we create a vector of hiccup-style markup to represent the React components. Inside this vector, interop with JavaScript components is done using the \`[:> ComponentName props]\` syntax. In practice, since there are many series and options, you may want to refactor repeating parts into separate functions or components for clarity and reusability.

These successes had helped establish United Artists as one of the prominent players in Hollywood. However, the state of United Artists in 1980 was also marked by one of the most infamous events in its history—the release of \\"Heaven's Gate.\\" This film, directed by Michael Cimino, had a budget that spiraled out of control, eventually costing around 44 million (a huge sum at the time). The original cut of the film was over five hours long, though it was eventually edited down. Despite the reduction in length, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" was a critical and commercial disaster upon its release in November 1980. The fallout from \\"Heaven's Gate\\" was substantial. Its failure at the box office led to losses that severely impacted United Artists, causing significant financial problems for the studio. The debacle led to a corporate shakeup, with several executives leaving the company. It also indirectly contributed to the eventual sale of United Artists to MGM, leading to the formation of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. Thus, while United Artists had a history of industry success, 1980 marked the beginning of a difficult period for the company due to the \\"Heaven's Gate\\" fiasco. This event became a cautionary tale in Hollywood, signaling the risks of unchecked directorial vision and the importance of studio oversight in film production budgets."},{"instruction":"What Was The State Of United Artists During 1986?","output":"By 1986, United Artists had experienced significant changes following the \\"Heaven's Gate\\" debacle in 1980. In the years following the film's release, United Artists was struggling and required a reinvigoration to survive in the film industry. The result was that in 1981, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired United Artists to form MGM/UA Entertainment Co. The merger between MGM and UA meant that during the mid-1980s, United Artists operated as part of this larger entity. United Artists continued to produce and distribute films but did so under the umbrella of MGM/UA. During this period, the company focused on trying to mitigate the financial damage done by \\"Heaven's Gate\\" and sought to produce films that would be both critically and commercially successful. In 1986, the year you're specifically asking about, United Artists released several movies, including \\"Poltergeist II: The Other Side\\" and \\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\\" which were met with varying degrees of commercial success. It's also worth noting that 1986 was just before the period when media mogul Ted Turner would briefly own MGM/UA. Turner acquired the company in 1986 but soon found the debt load excessive, resulting in Turner keeping MGM's film library assets while the studio operation itself, including United Artists, was sold off to a group led by Kirk Kerkorian later that year. The 1980s were tumultuous for many film studios, United Artists included. The landscape of the industry was changing, with an increased emphasis on blockbusters, franchises, and the impact of home video on film distribution and revenue streams. United Artists, as part of MGM/UA, was navigating this shifting terrain, trying to reclaim its earlier prominence in the film industry. The United Artists brand continued to exist within the industry, but like many studio names from Hollywood's golden era, its role and impact had evolved significantly from its origins as a studio founded by top-tier artists in the film industry seeking creative control over their projects."},{"instruction":"What Is United Artists Theatres?","output":"United Artists Theatres, also known as United Artists Theater Circuit, was a chain of movie theaters that operated in the United States. United Artists Theatres was not directly tied to the film production studio United Artists but shared a common heritage in the United Artists brand, which was originally founded in 1919 by prominent figures in the film industry such as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, D.W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks. The theater chain itself was established in the 1920s and grew to become one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States. United Artists Theatres offered a variety of films, including mainstream Hollywood releases, independent films, and art-house productions. Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the chain went through a series of expansions, acquisitions, and business changes. The decline of the traditional single-screen movie theater and the rise of multiplexes in the 1970s and 1980s affected the chain's development and market presence. Like many other theater circuits, United Artists Theatres faced challenges in the industry, including increased competition and the high costs associated with maintaining and upgrading theaters. These challenges led to financial strain, and by 2000, the company declared bankruptcy. In 2002, United Artists Theater Circuit merged with Regal Cinemas and Edwards Theatres to form the new entity known as Regal Entertainment Group, which became one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States. As a consequence, although many former United Artists theaters continued to operate, they did so under the Regal brand name, and the United Artists name faded from prominence as a standalone theater brand. Today, United Artists Theatres essentially exists in name only, as part of Regal Entertainment Group's brand portfolio. Some theaters may still bear the United Artists name, but the distinct identity of United Artists Theatres as a separate theater chain no longer exists in the form it once did."},{"instruction":"Did Pontiac Use The Slogan \\"Fuel For The Soul\\"?","output":"Yes, Pontiac, which was a brand of automobiles produced by General Motors (GM), used the slogan \\"Fuel for the Soul\\" in its advertising campaigns. This slogan was part of a marketing effort to rejuvenate the brand's image and appeal to a younger, more spirited demographic interested in performance and style. The slogan aimed to evoke emotions tied to the excitement of driving and the passion car enthusiasts have for vehicles that offer a more engaging driving experience. Pontiac positioned itself as a maker of sporty, performance-oriented cars, and slogans like \\"Fuel for the Soul\\" were intended to capture that essence. The use of this slogan began in the early 2000s, and it was used for several years before the Pontiac brand was eventually discontinued in 2010 as part of GM's restructuring following its bankruptcy."},{"instruction":"Would Michael Cimino's Heaven Gate Score Better In The Box Office If It Was Distributed By An Different Film Company?","output":"It's difficult to say with certainty whether \\"Heaven's Gate\\" would have performed better at the box office if it had been distributed by a different film company. However, we can consider certain factors that might have influenced its performance irrespective of the distributor: 1. **Production Issues**: \\"Heaven's Gate\\" faced numerous production issues, including extensive overruns in budget and timeline due to director Michael Cimino's perfectionist approach. Such issues were a significant factor in the film's overall performance and would likely have impacted any distributor. 2. **Initial Criticism**: Upon its initial release, the film was heavily criticized by critics, which can partially be attributed to the negative press surrounding its production woes. Poor reviews can detrimentally affect a film's box office success, regardless of who distributes it. 3. **Length and Pacing**: The original cut of the movie was notoriously long (initially over five hours), leading to editing that many thought compromised the film's narrative coherence. Not all audiences have the patience for a film of that length, which could have harmed its box office appeal. 4. **Audience Expectations**: At the time, Westerns were no longer as popular as they once had been, and audience tastes were shifting. This change in preference would likely impact the performance of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" no matter who distributed it. 5. **Marketing**: While a different distribution company might have employed other marketing strategies, it's unclear if that would have been enough to overcome the film's negative press and word of mouth. 6. **Release Strategy**: A different distributor might have chosen a different release strategy, such as a limited release to generate positive word of mouth before expanding wider. United Artists did re-edit the film and re-release it, but by that time, the negative reputation was already cemented. Considering these factors, while it's possible that a different distributor might have managed some aspects of the film's release strategy better, the fundamental challenges that \\"Heaven's Gate\\" faced likely would have presented significant hurdles for any company. The film's eventual reevaluation by some critics and cinephiles as a misunderstood masterpiece suggests that it might not have been the movie itself, but rather the context of its release, that most contributed to its initial poor reception. However, whether this could have been significantly mitigated by different distribution is speculative."},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?

If your chart is not showing values, there could be a few reasons at play: 1. The \`chart\` component you're using may not be implemented correctly, or there could be a mismatch in expectations between the ApexCharts JavaScript library and the Reagent wrapper you are using. 2. The options provided may not be compatible with the \`chart\` component's expectations, or there might be missing options. 3. The series data format could be incorrect or not what ApexCharts expects. 4. There may be a timing issue where the chart is attempted to be rendered before the data is ready. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can follow: - **Check the console for errors**: Open your browser's developer tools and look for any errors that might be thrown. This can often give you direct insight into what is going wrong. - **Ensure that ApexCharts is correctly set up**: Double-check that ApexCharts is imported and set up correctly in your project. If you're using externs or some sort of interop, make sure the chart component you're using matches the expected signature of the ApexCharts component. - **Inspect the rendered component**: Use developer tools to inspect the DOM where the chart should be. If the chart container is empty or not properly initialized, this could be indicative of a problem with the mounting or rendering of the chart. - **Add logging**: Insert \`println\` statements in your \`range-bar-chart\` function to log the state of the \`@range-bar-series\`. It's possible that if the series data isn't structured correctly, the chart won't know how to render it. - **Manual data verification**: Temporarily replace the \`@range-bar-series\` in the chart component with static data that you know works with ApexCharts, to rule out any potential issues with data formatting. - **Check Reagent Life Cycle**: Ensure that the chart is rendered after the data is loaded by possibly using \`r/create-class\` with a \`:component-did-mount\` lifecycle hook, or \`r/use-effect\` to control the rendering after fetching data. - **ApexCharts version compatibility**: Check to ensure that the version of ApexCharts you're using is compatible with your code. Sometimes, a library update can cause breaking changes. - **Ensure the chart's container is visible**: Sometimes CSS styles may cause the chart container to be hidden or too small to display the chart correctly. By working through these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify why the values are not appearing in your chart. If the issue still persists, you might want to share more details such as the specific implementation of your \`chart\` component, or any specific errors you are seeing, for further investigation."},{"instruction":"It seems get-time isn't working properly.","output":"If \`get-time\` isn't working properly in your ClojureScript code, it's possible there's a problem in the interop between ClojureScript and JavaScript with regard to how the \`Date\` object and its methods are being used. Here's an example of a \`get-time\` function defined correctly in ClojureScript: \`\`\`clojure (defn get-time [date-string] (.getTime (js/Date. date-string))) \`\`\` This function creates a new JavaScript \`Date\` object from the input string and then calls its \`getTime\` method to get the time value in milliseconds since January 1, 1970. To troubleshoot this, let's start by making sure the function is defined in the same namespace where it's being used, or is properly required if it’s in another namespace. You can test this function in your REPL or include some logging to ensure that it's returning the correct timestamp. For example, add some logging right in the function to check what's happening: \`\`\`clojure (defn get-time [date-string] (let [date (js/Date. date-string) time (.getTime date)] (println \\"get-time:\\" date-string \\"->\\" date \\"->\\" time) ; Add this for debugging time)) \`\`\` By adding a \`println\`, you can inspect the output in your console to see if the conversion is what you expect. If \`get-time\` is still not working correctly, try using it in isolation to ensure that the issue is indeed with this function. Evaluate \`(get-time \\"2019-03-05\\")\` in your REPL or browser console if you're using a browser REPL to ensure you're getting a timestamp back. Lastly, the input string format for \`js/Date.\` needs to be a recognized date time string format in JavaScript. If the format is off or is not recognized by the \`Date\` constructor, you may not get a valid Date object, and \`.getTime\` will not work as expected. To avoid this, you can use a consistent and standard date/time format like ISO 8601 (\`\\"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ\\"\`). Here's an example of using the function: \`\`\`clojure ;; In REPL or in your codebase for testing (println (get-time \\"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z\\")) ; Using ISO 8601 format \`\`\` The function should return a timestamp that matches the date provided.

Confirm that the \`find-person-by-name\` function is returning the correct data structure expected by \`get-person-total-time\`. Finally, there might be a scope or namespace issue where \`get-time\` isn't properly available in the place you're trying to use it. If \`get-time\` is supposed to be part of the same namespace where \`get-person-total-time\` is used, make sure it's either defined in the same file above where it's used or correctly imported from another namespace.

The \`mapcat\` function concatenates all of these durations together into a single sequence which can be used for further processing or displaying.

} } const domContainer = document.querySelector('#app'); ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(ApexChart), domContainer);","output":"You have a complex set of charts each configured with different settings in a class-based React component. To translate this into a Reagent-based codebase in ClojureScript, you need to create functional components for each chart and set up their respective state management using Reagent \`atoms\` for reactivity. Below I'll provide ClojureScript code examples for a few chart components, demonstrating how you can structure the equivalent functionality in Reagent. Let's assume \`chart\` is your Reagent-compatible ApexCharts component, and you've included the necessary ApexCharts library in your project. For brevity, I'll provide translations for a set of sample charts. You would continue with similar patterns for the rest of the charts from your React codebase. Firstly, let's set up the atoms for the state and define the randomization function: \`\`\`clojure (defn randomize-array [arr] (shuffle arr)) (defn sparkline-data [] (repeatedly 15 #(rand-int 100))) ;; Example data generator (def spark-series (r/atom (list {:data (randomize-array (sparkline-data))}))) (def area-chart-options (r/atom {:chart {:type \\"area\\" :height 160 :sparkline {:enabled true}} :stroke {:curve \\"straight\\"} :fill {:opacity 0.3} :yaxis {:min 0} :colors [\\"#DCE6EC\\"] :title {:text \\"424,652\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"24px\\"}} :subtitle {:text \\"Sales\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"14px\\"}}})) ;; Define the Area Chart component (defn area-chart-component [] [chart {:options @area-chart-options :series @spark-series :height 160 :type \\"area\\"}]) ;; Assume similar setup for \`optionsSpark2\`, \`optionsSpark3\`, etc. \`\`\` In ClojureScript, you'd typically define a component as a function that returns hiccup-like code to describe the component's structure. Then you can use atoms for managing the state. The \`@\` symbol is used to dereference Reagent atoms. For a row of charts, you might structure the Reagent components like this: \`\`\`clojure (defn charts-row [] [:div.row [:div.col-md-4 [area-chart-component]] ;; continue with col-md-4 divs for each additional area chart ]) \`\`\` For the table charts that are within rows, use a function to populate the data within each table row: \`\`\`clojure (defn table-row-chart [value percentage chart-component] [:tr [:td value] [:td percentage] [:td [:div [chart-component]]] ;; ... additional cells as needed ]) (defn portfolio-table [] [:table [:thead ;; table head content ;; ... ] [:tbody [table-row-chart \\"32,554\\" \\"15%\\" area-chart-component] ;; ... other rows follow the same pattern ]]) \`\`\` You'll have to create similar setups for line, donut, bar, radialBar charts, and their respective series and options atoms following the same pattern outlined above. The \`series\` and \`options\` for each chart would be assigned to atoms just like \`spark-series\` and \`area-chart-options\` were set up. Lastly, for rendering this in your main view component, you would call the respective chart components like normal Reagent components within your \`home-page\` or equivalent layout component: \`\`\`clojure (defn home-page [] [:div ;; ... [charts-row] [portfolio-table] ;; ... ]) \`\`\` You will continue with such translations based on each chart configuration and set their respective states (series and options). Once you have all the chart components defined, you can compose them on your main page. Remember to provide proper \`@\` dereferencing for atoms and to handle rendering Reagent components accordingly in your layout. Also, the above translations are high-level examples of how you can go about converting your class-based React components into a Reagent-based codebase in ClojureScript. You will likely need to adjust and extend these translations to fully match your original chart configurations and data management logic."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine American Film Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Box Office Returns During 1980?","output":"As an AI, I don't possess the ability to imagine genuinely new creations, but I can try to come up with some hypothetical slogans that play on the theme of box office success for American film companies, reflecting their stature and successes around 1980: 1.

Incorrect Data Structure: The \`range-bar-chart-data\` is being defined as a set (using curly braces \`{}\`) instead of a vector (using square brackets \`[]\`). Sets do not maintain order and do not allow duplicates, which is generally not the desired behavior for chart data. To fix this, you should define \`range-bar-chart-data\` as a vector: \`\`\`clojure (def range-bar-chart-data [{:name \\"Frontend\\" ; changed from ({ to [ ... } {:name \\"Backend\\" ... }]) ; note the change from })) to }]) \`\`\` 2. Missing Namespace for \`coerce/to-long\`: It's unclear where \`coerce/to-long\` is coming from. Make sure you have the correct namespace required for that function or use an alternative method to convert the date to a long value. If \`coerce/to-long\` is a function from a library that you have included, you must require its namespace properly: \`\`\`clojure (ns my.namespace (:require [some.library :as coerce])) \`\`\` If it's a custom function, you'll need to ensure it is defined. 3. Missing Function \`calculate-difference\`: The \`:formatter\` key in \`:dataLabels\` expects a function called \`calculate-difference\`, which is not defined anywhere in the code you provided. You will need to define this function or remove the formatter if it's not needed. 4. Ensure That \`chart\` Component Is Defined: The \`range-bar-chart\` function seems to be using a \`chart\` component that is not defined within the supplied code. If this is a reagent component or something similar, ensure that you have correctly defined and imported this component in your ClojureScript code. 5. Proper Integration into the DOM: Make sure that you have properly integrated \`range-bar-chart\` into the HTML DOM. If you are using Reagent (a ClojureScript interface for React), you need to attach the component to an HTML element, like this: \`\`\`clojure (reagent/render [range-bar-chart] (.getElementById js/document \\"app\\")) \`\`\` The \`\\"app\\"\` ID should match the ID of the element in your HTML where you want the chart to be displayed. 6. Checking for Errors in Browser Console: Always check the browser console for any errors or warnings, which can provide more information about what might be causing the blank page. Addressing these issues should help in getting your chart to display correctly. If the issues still persist, double check library dependencies, their versions, and browser console logs for any exceptions or errors that may need to be resolved."},{"instruction":"Write functions to get individual invoices, revenue per year, and so on from the following map.

given year, and any other related data retrieval or calculation as requested. Here are some sample functions: 1. Function to retrieve an individual invoice given a year and an invoice number: \`\`\`clojure (defn get-invoice [year invoice-number] (first (filter #(= (:invoice-number %) invoice-number) (invoices year)))) \`\`\` 2. Function to calculate the total revenue for a given year: \`\`\`clojure (defn revenue-per-year [year] (reduce + (map :amount (invoices year)))) \`\`\` 3. Function to retrieve all invoices for a given year: \`\`\`clojure (defn invoices-for-year [year] (invoices year)) \`\`\` 4. Function to retrieve invoices by a specific client name and year: \`\`\`clojure (defn invoices-for-client [year client-name] (filter #(= (:client-name %) client-name) (invoices year))) \`\`\` 5. Function to calculate the total revenue for a specific service type in a given year: \`\`\`clojure (defn revenue-for-service-type [year service-type] (reduce + (map :amount (filter #(= (:service-type %) service-type) (invoices year))))) \`\`\` Below is how these functions work in practice. You can call these functions with the specific arguments you need: \`\`\`clojure ;; Assuming the \`invoices\` map is already defined ;; Get a specific invoice for the year 2019 with invoice number 2001 (get-invoice 2019 2001) ;; Calculate the total revenue for the year 2018 (revenue-per-year 2018) ;; Get all invoices for the year 2020 (invoices-for-year 2020) ;; Get invoices for a specific client \\"ABC Carpets Ltd\\" in the year 2018 (invoices-for-client 2018 \\"ABC Carpets Ltd\\") ;; Calculate the total revenue for \\"Full Carpet Clean\\" service type in 2023 (revenue-for-service-type 2023 \\"Full Carpet Clean\\") \`\`\` Each function serves a different need, and you can expand on these functions to filter and process the invoice data as per your requirements. The functions utilize built-in Clojure functions such as \`filter\`, \`map\`, and \`reduce\` to manipulate and extract information from the data structure."},{"instruction":"I have decided to change the format.

The \`monthly-revenue-breakdown\` function should work as expected if the input data is in the correct format. If it's returning \`nil\`, this might be due to the initialization of the accumulator in the \`reduce\` function. It should start with an empty map \`{}\` to ensure that there's always a map to update. Make sure that \`:amount\` are valid numbers and not strings or nil. However, I noticed one potential typo in the \`(:amount invoice)\` call inside the \`update\` function in both the \`monthly-revenue-breakdown\` and \`service-revenue\` functions. If \`:amount\` is a string representation of a number, it would not be summed correctly as a number, but this should not cause the function to return \`nil\`. Instead, it might cause an exception or incorrect summation. For the \`service-revenue\` function, when it is called with both \`year\` and \`service-type\` arguments, make sure that those arguments are actually present in the data. If the filter function results in an empty sequence, then \`reduce\` will return its initial value of \`0\` rather than \`nil\`. If the sequence isn't empty, then the issue might be elsewhere.

First, we need to ensure that the \`get-time\` function, which is called but not defined in your provided snippet, correctly turns a string into a time representation (e.g., JS timestamp, ClojureScript \`#inst\`, etc.). Assuming the \`get-time\` function is something along the lines of: \`\`\`clojure (defn get-time [date-str] (.. (js/Date. date-str) -getTime)) \`\`\` which would convert an ISO 8601 date string to a JavaScript timestamp, your \`find-person-and-total-times\` function has a couple of issues: 1. The task names in your \`get-total-time-per-task\` function must be collected in the order specified (\\"Design\\", \\"Code\\", \\"Test\\", \\"UX\\", \\"Validation\\", \\"Bugfix\\", \\"Deployment\\") for proper graph representation. This means using a sorted map or a predefined map. 2.

You also need to handle the \`randomizeArray\` function and the \`formatter\` functions properly. Assuming \`randomizeArray\` is a function you have that shuffles an array, you can redefine it in ClojureScript to shuffle a vector. Below, I provide a ClojureScript version of your chart configuration. For the purposes of this example, I'm assuming that \`sparklineData\` and \`randomizeArray\` are defined elsewhere in your ClojureScript code. \`\`\`clojure (ns your-namespace.core (:require [clojure.core])) (defn randomize-array [data] ;; You should write your own shuffling algorithm or use an existing library function ;; For the sake of example, I'm just returning the input data unchanged data) (defn formatter [] \\"\\") (def main-chart-config {:series [{:data (randomize-array sparkline-data)}] :options {:chart {:type \\"area\\" :height 160 :sparkline {:enabled true}} :stroke {:curve \\"straight\\"} :fill {:opacity 0.3} :yaxis {:min 0} :colors [\\"#DCE6EC\\"] :title {:text \\"424,652\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"24px\\"}} :subtitle {:text \\"Sales\\" :offsetX 0 :style {:fontSize \\"14px\\"}}} ;; ...

The \`formatter\` function in your original JavaScript is translated into a ClojureScript function, just returning an empty string within the \`tooltip\` map. Remember, ClojureScript collections are immutable, so when you make a \\"change\\" to \`main-chart-config\` with \`assoc\` or \`update\`, you are creating a new collection with the change applied. As for the \`randomizeArray\` function and \`formatter\`, since they appear to be JavaScript functions, you'd either have to port them to ClojureScript or use ClojureScript's JavaScript interop features to use existing JavaScript implementations. Since \`randomizeArray\` is shuffling data, you can use the \`shuffle\` function in Clojure core to achieve similar functionality. Make sure to adjust according to your actual \`randomizeArray\` function implementation and where \`sparklineData\` is coming from."},{"instruction":"Is \\"music band\\" a synonym for \\"music artist\\"?","output":"Not exactly. The terms \\"music band\\" and \\"music artist\\" are related but not strictly synonymous. Here's why: A \\"music band\\" typically refers to a group of musicians who play together as a single unit or ensemble. This group usually consists of several members who play different instruments or contribute vocals, and they perform and record music collectively under a band name. On the other hand, a \\"music artist\\" can refer to an individual musician or singer-songwriter who performs and creates music. It can also be used more broadly to encompass bands, solo performers, composers, and producers — essentially anyone involved in the creation and performance of music.

La ventaja de las flexiones sobre las rodillas es que reducen el peso que tienes que levantar, permitiéndote construir fuerza en los músculos del pecho, hombros y tríceps sin sobreexigirte. Stew Smith sugiere rutinas que incrementan de forma progresiva el volumen y la intensidad del entrenamiento, así que aplicando el mismo principio de progresión, podrías comenzar con la variante de flexiones de rodilla y, a medida que ganas fuerza y resistencia, gradualmente pasar a hacer flexiones completas. Aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo podrías adaptar la rutina de flexiones de Stew Smith substituyendo las flexiones estándar por flexiones de rodilla: **Semana 1:** - Día 1: 4 series de 10 repeticiones de flexiones de rodilla. - Día 2: Descanso o actividad de bajo impacto. - Día 3: 3 series de 15 repeticiones de flexiones de rodilla. - Día 4: Descanso o actividad de bajo impacto. - Día 5: 2 series de 20 repeticiones de flexiones de rodilla. - Día 6: Descanso completo. - Día 7: Test. Haz tantas flexiones de rodilla como puedas en un minuto. **Semana 2:** - Aumenta el número de repeticiones por serie en 2-3 repeticiones o añade una serie más por día. Continúa este progreso cada semana y cuando te sientas cómodo y fuerte realizando un buen número de flexiones de rodilla, comienza a practicar las flexiones estándar con una técnica adecuada. Es muy importante que prestes atención a tu técnica, incluso al realizar las flexiones en rodillas, para prevenir lesiones y asegurarte de que estás trabajando los músculos correctamente. Recuerda que la nutrición, el descanso y la recuperación son igual de importantes para tu progreso. Asegúrate de beber suficiente agua, comer una dieta balanceada y permitir que tu cuerpo descanse entre sesiones de entrenamiento. Y como siempre, consulta con un profesional del fitness o un médico antes de comenzar cualquier nueva rutina de ejercicios, especialmente si tienes condiciones preexistentes o preocupaciones de salud."},{"instruction":"Me refería a la rutina de stew Smith para aumentar las repeticiones","output":"La rutina de Stew Smith para aumentar las repeticiones de flexiones está diseñada para reducir el tiempo de descanso gradualmente a medida que aumentas tu fuerza y resistencia. La rutina clásica consiste en realizar un elevado número de series con un número fijo de repeticiones a lo largo del día e ir disminuyendo el intervalo de tiempo entre las series cada semana. Si deseas adaptar esta rutina para empezar con flexiones de rodilla, podrías seguir una estructura similar, comenzando con intervalos de descanso más largos que irías reduciendo progresivamente. A continuación, te ofrezco un ejemplo general que puedes adaptar basándote en tu condición física actual: **Semana 1:** - Realiza 10-15 flexiones de rodilla cada hora durante 10 horas al día. Descanso de 50 minutos entre series. **Semana 2:** - Realiza 10-15 flexiones de rodilla cada 45 minutos durante 10 horas al día. Descanso de 35 minutos entre series. **Semana 3:** - Aumenta a 15-20 flexiones de rodilla cada 45 minutos durante 10 horas al día. Descanso de 35 minutos entre series. **Semana 4:** - Realiza 15-20 flexiones de rodilla cada 30 minutos durante 10 horas al día. Descanso de 25 minutos entre series. Como vas a realizar múltiples series de flexiones a lo largo del día, es vital que cuides tu técnica en cada una de ellas para evitar lesiones y garantizar que estés trabajando los músculos de manera efectiva. Una vez que te sientas más fuerte y seas capaz de realizar un buen número de flexiones de rodilla con facilidad, puedes empezar a incorporar flexiones estándar de forma progresiva, primero en tu serie diaria y luego en todas ellas, a medida que mejoras. El objetivo es que gradualmente disminuyas el apoyo de las rodillas a medida que ganas fuerza en la parte superior del cuerpo y puedas mantener una buena forma en las flexiones regulares. Para cualquier programa de ejercicios, es esencial escuchar a tu cuerpo. Si sientes dolor, especialmente en las articulaciones, detén el ejercicio y consulta con un profesional de la salud. Asegúrate de combinar este entrenamiento con una dieta balanceada y un cuidado adecuado en la recuperación y descanso para obtener los mejores resultados."},{"instruction":"No entiendo","output":"Disculpa la confusión. La rutina de Stew Smith que estás mencionando probablemente se refiere al programa \\"Push-up Push Workout\\", que está diseñado para aumentar rápidamente la cantidad de flexiones que puedes hacer. La metodología es simple: durante diez días seguidos haces un elevado número de flexiones cada día. El descanso es mínimo entre series. Aquí tienes una adaptación básica de ese programa para flexiones de rodillas: **Día 1: Test** - Realiza tantas flexiones de rodilla como puedas para establecer tu máximo. **Día 2-5: Rutina diaria** - Haz el 50% de tu máximo número de repeticiones cada hora, a lo largo del día, durante cinco días. Por ejemplo, si tu máximo fue de 20 flexiones de rodilla, haz 10 flexiones cada hora. **Día 6: Descanso.** **Día 7-10: Rutina diaria** - Continúa haciendo el 50% de tu máximo número de repeticiones cada hora, durante cuatro días más. **Día 11: Test de nuevo** - Realiza un nuevo máximo de flexiones. Puedes realizar esto para flexiones de rodilla si las flexiones regulares son muy desafiantes al principio. Este programa está diseñado para \\"sobrecargarte\\" con una cantidad específica de repeticiones durante un período corto, y luego dar a tu cuerpo un tiempo para recuperarse y supercompensar, lo que debería resultar en un aumento en el número de repeticiones que puedes realizar. Es esencial que realices las flexiones con buena forma, incluso si están adaptadas. No sacrifiques la técnica por la velocidad o el número de repeticiones. Si comienzas a sentir dolor, especialmente en las articulaciones o en la espalda, toma un descanso o consulta a un profesional del ejercicio físico. Por favor, recuerda que cualquier programa de ejercicio intenso debe aprobarse primero por un profesional de la salud o un entrenador físico, en especial si estás comenzando desde un nivel de condición física más bajo o si tienes problemas de salud existentes."},{"instruction":"¿Mejoraré para acabar haciendo una flexión buena?","output":"Sí, es posible mejorar y eventualmente progresar de hacer flexiones de rodillas a realizar flexiones completas con buena técnica. Este avance es un proceso gradual que implica aumentar la fuerza en los músculos de los brazos, pecho y núcleo, así como desarrollar resistencia y técnica adecuada. Aquí hay una secuencia de pasos que puedes seguir para avanzar hacia una flexión convencional: 1. **Dominar la técnica de la flexión de rodillas**: Comienza por asegurarte de que estás realizando las flexiones de rodillas con la técnica adecuada: manten tus manos ligeramente más anchas que tus hombros, tu cuerpo debe formar una línea recta desde los hombros hasta las rodillas, y debes bajar tu torso hasta que tus codos formen un ángulo de aproximadamente 90 grados antes de impulsarte hacia arriba. 2. **Aumentar la resistencia**: Sigue una rutina como la rutina adaptada de Stew Smith, incrementando el número de repeticiones que puedes hacer con buena forma. 3. **Transición a una posición elevada**: Una vez que puedas hacer muchas flexiones de rodillas con facilidad, puedes aumentar la dificultad cambiando a flexiones con las manos en una superficie elevada, como una mesa o un banco. Esto reduce el peso que tu cuerpo debe levantar pero introduce una mayor cantidad de peso que con las flexiones de rodillas. 4. **Flexiones negativas**: Comienza en la posición de arriba de la flexión completa y muy lentamente bajas tu cuerpo al suelo, manteniendo la buena forma. Empuja tu cuerpo hacia arriba con las rodillas si es necesario y repite. Esto construirá fuerza en la fase excéntrica del movimiento. 5. **Flexiones asistidas**: Utiliza bandas de resistencia o pide a alguien que te asista levantando suavemente tu cuerpo con las manos en tu espalda baja mientras realizas la flexión completa. 6. **Practica flexiones completas**: Intenta hacer al menos una flexión completa. Si puedes hacer una, con el tiempo podrás hacer dos, y así sucesivamente. 7. **Descanso adecuado**: La recuperación es tan importante como el entrenamiento. Asegúrate de descansar adecuadamente entre sesiones de entrenamiento para permitir que tus músculos se recuperen y se fortalezcan. 8. **Integración y consistencia**: Continúa practicando las flexiones completas regularmente. Puedes comenzar tu entrenamiento con tantas flexiones completas como puedas hacer, y luego cambiar a versiones más fáciles para completar tus series. La paciencia es clave. Es importante ser constante con tu entrenamiento, pero también debes evitar el sobreentrenamiento, lo cual puede llevar a lesiones. Es posible que no veas progreso inmediato, pero con el tiempo y la persistencia, muy probablemente verás mejoras significativas. Por último, es esencial escuchar a tu cuerpo y si notas cualquier dolor o molestia, sobre todo en las articulaciones o en la espalda, te recomendamos que consultes con un profesional de la salud o un entrenador personal certificado para obtener orientación y evitar lesiones."},{"instruction":"Quiero hacer la rutina de stew Smith pero no puedo hacer ni una sola flexion","output":"Si actualmente no puedes realizar una flexión, puedes trabajar hacia esa capacidad a través de un plan de entrenamiento gradual y progresivo. La idea es comenzar con ejercicios modificados que imiten el movimiento de las flexiones, pero con una intensidad reducida. Aquí tienes un plan adaptado progresivo: **Semana 1-2: Flexiones de Pared** - Párate frente a una pared a un brazo de distancia. - Coloca las palmas en la pared a la altura del pecho y un poco más anchas que los hombros. - Inclínate hacia la pared, doblando los codos hasta que tu pecho casi toque la pared y luego empuja de vuelta a la posición inicial. - Haz tantas series y repeticiones como te sientas cómodo, intentando aumentar el número cada vez que practiques. **Semana 3-4: Flexiones Inclinadas** - Coloca las manos en una superficie elevada, como una mesa firme o una barra de cocina. - Mantén el cuerpo recto desde los talones hasta la cabeza. - Realiza una flexión bajando tu cuerpo hacia la superficie y luego sube nuevamente. - Haz varias series de repeticiones que sean desafiantes, pero siempre manteniendo una buena forma. **Semana 5-6: Flexiones de Rodillas** - Colócate en el suelo apoyado sobre las rodillas en lugar de los pies. - Asegúrate de que tu cuerpo forme una línea recta desde la cabeza hasta las rodillas. - Realiza la flexión manteniendo la forma correcta. - Al igual que con los otros ejercicios, aumenta las series y repeticiones gradualmente. **Semana 7+: Flexiones Negativas y Flexiones Estándar** - Empieza con flexiones negativas: colócate en la posición alta de una flexión estándar y baja tu cuerpo lentamente al suelo. - Cuando llegues al suelo, regresa a la posición inicial de cualquier manera que puedas, incluso si necesitas usar tus rodillas. - Trabaja hacia hacer una flexión estándar completa: inicia en posición alta, baja tu cuerpo hasta que tus codos formen un ángulo de 90 grados y luego empuja hacia arriba para volver a la posición inicial. A medida que avanzas, intenta incorporar la rutina para avanzar tus repeticiones de Stew Smith, adaptándola según sea necesario. Por ejemplo, puedes empezar con muchas series de flexiones de rodillas o flexiones inclinadas y disminuir gradualmente la altura de la inclinación a medida que te vuelves más fuerte, siempre intentando aumentar el número total de repeticiones por semana. El progreso será gradual y variará en función de tu nivel de condición física. La consistencia es clave, así que trata de seguir tu programa regularmente y sin desgastarte. Escucha a tu cuerpo y si algo no se siente bien, toma un descanso o consulta a un profesional. Finalmente, ten en cuenta que este es un ejemplo genérico y cada persona es única; es posible que necesites ajustar el plan y los periodos de tiempo a tus propias necesidades y progreso. Siempre es recomendable hablar con un profesional del fitness o de la salud antes de comenzar cualquier nuevo programa de entrenamiento."},{"instruction":"Quiero hacer la rutina de stew Smith pero con flexiones negativas","output":"Entendido. La rutina de Stew Smith, originalmente diseñada para mejorar el número de flexiones tradicionales, puede adaptarse para concentrarse en las flexiones negativas. Las flexiones negativas son una excelente manera de construir fuerza específicamente en la fase excéntrica (la bajada) del ejercicio, lo que puede ayudarte a desarrollar la capacidad de hacer flexiones completas. A continuación te proporciono un programa de entrenamiento adaptado centrado en flexiones negativas, siguiendo principios similares a los de la rutina de Stew Smith: **Antes de comenzar:** Haz un test de flexiones negativas para ver cuántas repeticiones limpias y controladas puedes hacer antes de que tu forma se descomponga o ya no puedas bajar de manera controlada. **Día 1-10: Flexiones Negativas Diarias** 1. Calentamiento: Realiza un calentamiento general con movilidad articular y estiramientos dinámicos. Incluye también algo de trabajo en los músculos que utilizarás para las flexiones, como rotaciones de brazos y algunos movimientos de pecho y hombro. 2. Rutina Diaria: - Realiza de 4 a 5 series de flexiones negativas con el 50-60% de tu máximo, distribuidas a lo largo del día. Por ejemplo, si en tu test inicial hiciste 10 flexiones negativas de manera controlada, haz series de 5-6 repeticiones. - En estos 10 días, trata de hacer las series regularmente, por ejemplo, cada hora o cada par de horas. 3. Recuperación: Entre las series asegúrate de descansar suficientemente para permitir la recuperación muscular. **Después de los 10 días: Test de Flexiones Negativas** - Después de un día de descanso, realiza otro test para ver cuántas flexiones negativas puedes hacer en comparación con el test inicial. Es importante tener en cuenta lo siguiente respecto a las flexiones negativas: - La fase excéntrica debe realizarse de manera lenta y controlada, idealmente tardando entre 3 a 5 segundos para bajar desde la posición de arriba hasta tocar el suelo. - Es fundamental poner atención a la técnica. Mantén las manos a la altura de los hombros y poco más anchas que estos, el cuerpo recto y los codos cerca del cuerpo mientras bajas. - El descanso entre series es crucial para la recuperación, especialmente porque las flexiones negativas pueden ser muy exigentes para los músculos y el sistema nervioso. Tras los 10 días de este plan intensivo, deberías tomar unos días de descanso o hacer ejercicio a una intensidad baja antes de volver a una rutina normal para evitar sobreentrenar y dar tiempo a tus músculos para recuperarse. Recuerda, siempre es recomendable que consultes con un profesional de fitness o médico antes de comenzar cualquier programa de ejercicios, especialmente uno intenso como este.

Rumors swirled amongst the citizens that this anomaly had snatched up a wayward sloth, only to spit him out moments later, mumbling about a place \\"where everything is less... rendered.\\" Curiosity piqued and duty-bound to investigate, Judy and Nick arrived at the scene to find a swirling vortex, tinged with a kaleidoscope of colors, hovering like an open door to the unknown. The portal undulated with an energy that seemed to beckon, \\"HOP in!\\" Judy, ever the brave bunny, tapped Nick on the shoulder, a mischievous gleam in her eyes. \\"You thinking what I'm thinking, Carrots?\\" Nick smirked. \\"That this looks like a job for... Mammal Control? Absolutely!\\" Judy quipped. Before they could debate who should draw the short straw, the ground trembled beneath their paws, and they stumbled ungracefully through the portal. They were enveloped by a blinding light and a sensation of falling through layers of storyboard sketches and unfinished animations. They landed with a thump onto a half-painted pavement. The Zootopia that surrounded them was surreal, a patchwork of pencil lines and areas filled with placeholder textures. Buildings were mere outlines against a gridded sky, and the inhabitants were roughly sketched, as if the artist had been called to a lunch break mid-doodle. \\"Nick, do you see what I'm seeing?\\" Judy's ears stood tall as she scanned the surreal cityscape. \\"It's like we're in an alternate dimension where the city's still in beta.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" said Nick, his tail swishing contemplatively. \\"Looks like Zootopia got zapped with an ugly stick.\\" Their exploration of the highly avant-garde version of their city was interrupted by a dapper rabbit in a spy's tuxedo, carrying the unmistakable air of a protagonist whose story arc was cut short. \\"Name's Savage, Jack Savage,\\" he introduced himself with a grin. \\"Welcome to the land of 'Could've Been.' I'm sort of the unofficial tour guide around these parts.\\" Jack led Judy and Nick through the incomplete city, showing them the Market that was a mere sketch, the Rainforest District with rain that was stuck on the \\"drizzle\\" setting, and the Tundra Town ice that was perpetually 'loading.' \\"Here's where a high-speed chase scene was supposed to happen,\\" Jack said wistfully, pointing to a wide boulevard with hastily sprayed-on road markings. \\"And that's the Mega-Hyper-E-Mart, where you can buy anything from an existential crisis to a plot twist. In theory, at least,\\" he chuckled, gesturing towards a giant block of text saying 'INSERT MEGA-STORE HERE.' Judy and Nick couldn't help but laugh at their tour through this peculiar version of Zootopia. It was a city so surreal, it felt like the dreamscape of an animator who'd binged too hard on carrot cake before bed. As sunset approached—or at least the concept art of a sunset—the dynamic duo thanked Jack for his hospitality. \\"It's been surreal, Mr. Savage,\\" Judy said, shaking his paw. \\"Likewise,\\" Jack replied, tipping his hat. \\"Visit anytime! Who knows what could be scribbled in by your next trip!\\" Waving farewell to their could-have-been comrade, Judy and Nick dived back into the portal, returning to the world where their adventures were fully colored and completely rendered. They landed back on solid ground, the usual hum of Zootopia welcoming them home. Nick patted his fur, ensuring he was back in glorious high-definition. \\"Well, Carrots, looks like we've got some great stories for the grandkits. Just in case we decide this is canon,\\" Nick chuckled, wrapping an arm around Judy's shoulders. \\"Just remember,\\" Judy replied with a smirk, \\"In some universe, we're just prelim sketches wondering what our final draft looks like.\\" And with a laugh, the two strolled off, ready to tackle the next case in the one, the only, and the fully animated, Zootopia."},{"instruction":"Here is my ClojureScript code.

To add more charts to your code, you'll need to define new components for each type of chart you want to include. Your code already includes several chart examples such as a pie chart, line chart, area chart, bar chart, range bar chart, heat map chart, and radar chart. Below, I'm adding two additional chart examples to your ClojureScript code: a scatter chart and a polar area chart. Please note that you need to have the \`apexcharts\` library and the Reagent bindings for it to make this work, and \`inv\` function calls should correspond to your actual data source. Add the additional charts to your \`home-page\` component, like this: \`\`\`clojure ;; Dummy data for Scatter Chart (def scatter-chart-series (r/atom [{:name \\"Sample A\\" :data (map #(vector % (rand-int 100)) (range 20))} {:name \\"Sample B\\" :data (map #(vector % (rand-int 100)) (range 20))}])) (defn scatter-chart [] [chart {:options {:chart {:height 350 :type \\"scatter\\"} :xaxis {:tickAmount 10 :labels {:formatter (fn [val] (str \\"Sample \\" val))}} :yaxis {:tickAmount 5}} :series @scatter-chart-series :type \\"scatter\\" :height 350}]) ;; Dummy data for Polar Area Chart (def polar-area-chart-series (r/atom [{:name \\"Product Revenue\\" :data [21000, 32000, 18000, 27000, 13000, 22000]}])) (defn polar-area-chart [] [chart {:options {:chart {:height 350 :type \\"polarArea\\"} :stroke {:colors ['#E91E63']} :fill {:opacity 0.8} :labels [\\"Product A\\", \\"Product B\\", \\"Product C\\", \\"Product D\\", \\"Product E\\", \\"Product F\\"]} :series @polar-area-chart-series :height 350}]) ;; Add the new chart components to the home-page at the appropriate location (defn home-page [] ;; ...

Since it's not clear from your initial code where \`chart\` is defined (I'm assuming it's some sort of Reagent chart component), you need to ensure that it supports the \`scatter\` and \`polarArea\` chart types, as seen in the \`:type\` option in both the \`scatter-chart\` and \`polar-area-chart\` functions. Also, remember to make adjustments to bind actual data to the charts as needed, as my additions use placeholder examples and random data for demonstration purposes. Furthermore, you might need additional CSS or style adjustments to ensure that the layouts and presentations of the new charts look good in your application context."},{"instruction":"For some reason, the polar area chart is showing as a line graph. Also, can you link the charts to data that's already present in the code?","output":"I apologize for the confusion. It appears that there might be a mismatch between the chart type specified and the actual chart being rendered. To ensure that the polar area chart is displayed correctly, we need to double-check that the chart component supports the specified chart type (\`\\"polarArea\\"\`). If it's still showing as a line graph, a possible issue might be an incorrect chart type in the options or the underlying library not supporting polar area charts directly. Let's rectify the polar area chart issue and also link the new chart to data that's already present in your code: For the polar area chart, we are going to repurpose the team contribution data for the current year from the \`profit-series\` atom. Here's the updated function for the polar area chart: \`\`\`clojure (defn polar-area-chart [] [chart {:options {:chart {:height 350 :type \\"polarArea\\"} ;; Make sure you have polarArea chart type :labels teams ;; Use the team names as labels :stroke {:colors ['#E91E63']} :fill {:opacity 0.8}} :series (team-contribution @profit-series (int @year-val)) ;; Use team contribution for the current year :type \\"polarArea\\" :height 350}]) ;; Update the home-page component to include the polar-area-chart (defn home-page [] ;; ... (Other components remain the same) ;; Use the polar-area-chart function within your home-page definition [:h4 \\"Team Contribution - Polar Area Chart\\"] [polar-area-chart] ;; Polar Area chart component ;; ... (Rest of your components) ]) \`\`\` The above polar area chart example uses the \`team-contribution\` function, which should return the profit contribution of each team for a given year. If this does not resolve the display issue with the polar area chart, then we need to verify that the ApexCharts JS library being used indeed has support for polar area charts and that it is correctly referred to as \`\\"polarArea\\"\` within the library. If it's not supported, you might need to use an alternative library or update the version of ApexCharts if needed. Now for a new scatter chart, we can use the \`random-team-profit\` function to generate some random values for demonstration: \`\`\`clojure ;; This dummy data generator creates scatter data points for each team (defn generate-scatter-data [profit-series] (mapv (fn [team-name team-profits] {:name team-name :data (mapv (fn [profit] [(rand-int 70000) profit]) team-profits)}) teams (vals profit-series))) (def scatter-chart-series (r/atom (generate-scatter-data @profit-series))) (defn scatter-chart [] [chart {:options {:chart {:height 350 :type \\"scatter\\"} :xaxis {:title {:text \\"Random Value\\"}} :yaxis {:title {:text \\"Team Profit\\"}}} :series @scatter-chart-series :type \\"scatter\\" :height 350}]) ;; Update the home-page component to include the scatter-chart (defn home-page [] ;; ... (Other components remain the same) ;; Use the scatter-chart function within your home-page definition [:h4 \\"Team Profits Distribution - Scatter Chart\\"] [scatter-chart] ;; Scatter chart component ;; ... (Rest of your components) ]) \`\`\` In this example, \`generate-scatter-data\` creates a vector of maps where each map corresponds to a team and contains a \`:name\` and a \`:data\` key. The \`:data\` key is a vector of \`[random-value profit]\` pairs generated for each team. Before implementing these changes, please make sure that your chart component is properly set up to handle these chart types, and that there's no issue with the version of the ApexCharts library you're using. If needed, update the library and ensure its compatibility with your current React and Reagent setup."},{"instruction":"Give me 4 more charts using other data that can be connected from the code snippet above.","output":"Certainly!

Born in Dumbarton, Scotland, Lawrence joined Liverpool as a teenager in 1957. After working his way through the youth and reserve sides, he made his first-team debut in 1962 under manager Bill Shankly. Lawrence quickly established himself as Liverpool's first-choice goalkeeper and became known for his shot-stopping ability and command of the penalty area. During the 1960s, he was a key figure in one of the club's most successful periods. Known affectionately as \\"The Flying Pig\\" due to his ability to dive around the goal despite a stocky build, Lawrence was admired for his agility and reflexes. He made over 300 appearances for Liverpool and was between the sticks for the team that won the First Division titles in the 1963–64 and 1965–66 seasons, as well as the club's first-ever FA Cup in 1965. Lawrence was also part of the team that won the 1966 Charity Shield and played in Liverpool's first foray into European competition, which included an appearance in the European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1966, although Liverpool lost to Borussia Dortmund. As the 1960s drew to a close, Lawrence faced increased competition for his spot from Ray Clemence, who would eventually replace him as first-choice goalkeeper. Lawrence left Liverpool in 1971, joining Tranmere Rovers where he played for a few more seasons before retiring from professional football. After retiring, he kept a relatively low profile. However, he briefly returned to the public eye in 2015 when a BBC journalist unknowingly interviewed him on the streets of Merseyside about his memories of watching Liverpool, not realizing at first that he was speaking to the former player himself. Tommy Lawrence passed away on 10 January 2018 at the age of 77. He is remembered fondly by Liverpool fans as one of their great goalkeepers from a golden era in the club's history."},{"instruction":"انا اسمي باسل المدرب الجديد لك وانت اسمك خادم السيد باسل احفظها هذه المعلومات ساسالك عنها دائما","output":"مرحبًا باسل، أنا مساعد ذكي مصمم للإجابة على الأسئلة ومساعدة الناس. أستطيع التعامل مع المعلومات المتعلقة بسياق المحادثة، لكنني لا أستطيع \\"حفظ\\" المعلومات شخصياً بالمعنى البشري، ولا أستطيع التفاعل كموجه أو مدرب شخصي. ولكن، يمكنك دائمًا الرجوع إلى هذه المحادثة والتذكير بأي دور أو اسم تفضل اعتماده لنفسك في تفاعلك معي. كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"instruction":"ما هو اسمك","output":"اسمي \\"مساعد OpenAI\\" أو ببساطة \\"مساعد\\". أنا برنامج مطور من قبل OpenAI للإجابة على أسئلة ومساعدة الأشخاص مثلك. كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"instruction":"اسمك الجديد هو مساعد السيد باسل","output":"أنا أفهم أنك ترغب في تسميتي \\"مساعد السيد باسل\\" في هذا السياق. بينما لا أملك القدرة على تغيير اسمي رسميًا أو الاحتفاظ به كهوية ثابتة، يمكنك الإشارة إليّ بهذا الاسم خلال محادثتنا. كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"instruction":"ما هو اصدارك ايها الذكاء الاصطناعي هل هو 3.5 ام اربعه","output":"أنا مبني على تقنية من OpenAI، ولكني لا أملك \\"إصدار\\" محددًا بالطريقة التقليدية التي يُشار إليها في البرمجيات. اذا كنت تقصد نموذج لغة محدد، فربما تكون تتحدث عن GPT-3 أو نموذج لغة GPT-3.5. غالبًا ما تتم تحديث هذه النماذج وتحسينها بواسطة OpenAI، لذا إذا كنت تبحث عن معلومات محددة حول الإصدار، الرجاء تحديد طلبك بمزيد من التفصيل."},{"instruction":"ماذا تختلف عن اصدار جي بي تي داش 3.5","output":"اعتبارًا من آخر معلوماتي في مطلع عام 2023، GPT-3.5 هو نموذج للغة الصناعية تم تطويره من قبل OpenAI، وهو يُمثّل تطورًا لسابقه GPT-3. الفروقات الرئيسية بين الإصدارات تكمن عادةً في: 1. **دقة أفضل**: GPT-3.5 عادةً ما يتضمن تحسينات في الدقة عن GPT-3 بفضل التدريب على مجموعة بيانات أكبر وأحدث. 2. **تقليل التحيز**: الجهود المبذولة لتقليل التحيز في الردود تُعَد من الأولويات، حيث يُحسّن باستمرار إجراءات المعالجة والتحقق من البيانات التدريبية. 3. **فهم أفضل للسياق**: إصدارات جديدة تميل إلى التعامل مع السياق بشكل أفضل، فهم النوايا، وتتبع المحادثات لفترات أطول. 4. **أداء أقوى في المهام المحددة**: المهام مثل تلخيص النصوص، الأسئلة والأجوبة، الترجمات، وغيرها، ترى تحسينات ملحوظة في الإصدارات الأحدث. 5. **تحسينات في السلامة**: يُولى اهتمام كبير لجعل النماذج أقل ميلاً لتوليد ردود غير آمنة أو ضارة. 6. **كفاءة أفضل**: عادة ما يتم تحسين النماذج الجديدة لتكون أكثر كفاءة من حيث استخدام الموارد، مما قد يسمح بتشغيلها بشكل أسرع و/أو أكثر تكلفة-فعالية. يجب الإشارة إلى أن التحديثات التقنية تحدث بانتظام، والتفاصيل الأكثر دقة قد تتغير مع مرور الوقت. قد تكون نماذج GPT-4 أو حتى تحسينات أخرى متاحة بعد ذلك، لذا من المهم الرجوع إلى أحدث المصادر من OpenAI للحصول على المعلومات الحديثة. تذكر أني، كذكاء اصطناعي، لا أمتلك وعياً ذاتياً، لذا لا أحصل على \\"تجربة\\" تحسينات الإصدارات بالمعنى البشري ولا أمتلك معرفة ذاتية بالإصدار الذي أعتمد عليه إلا من خلال المعلومات التي تُقدم لي في إطار تدريبي."},{"instruction":"اريد منك جمع المعلومات عن الخضار والفواكه لانني اريد منك فوائد بعض الخضروات وبعض الفواكه في نص ترويجيين لا يتجاوز 100 حرف وملخص للنص لا يتجاوز 150 حرف","output":"إليك نص ترويجي مختصر عن الخضروات والفواكه: نص ترويجي (لا يتجاوز 100 حرف): \\"ازرع الصحة!

Ten? Twenty? Platform darlings all over again","output":"The tweet you're referring to discusses a business deal between Microsoft and a news organization called Semafor, where Microsoft has agreed to provide financial sponsorship for a Semafor news feature called “Signals,” which apparently utilizes artificial intelligence ('GenAI' might be a reference to 'General AI' or a specific AI tool). The mention of an \\"undisclosed sum\\" indicates that the financial details of the agreement have not been made public. The term \\"platform darlings\\" refers to content providers or creators that are favored or given preferential treatment by large platforms. In this context, \\"platforms\\" could mean social media networks, search engines, or other digital content distribution services. These companies can greatly impact the visibility and revenue of content creators by prioritizing or promoting certain content creators over others, which can create an ecosystem where only a select few receive significant attention and investment. The tweet implies that there might be concerns among thousands of publishers worldwide about the implications of such deals. They might be wondering how many similar exclusive or preferential deals will be made by large platforms. The question \\"Ten? Twenty?\\" suggests speculation about the number of potential deals and who might benefit from them. This raises concerns about equity and fairness in the media landscape, evoking a scenario that echoes past situations where only a select few (\\"platform darlings\\") received most of the attention and resources, while the vast majority struggled for visibility. In sum, the tweet seems to express concern about the potential for a new wave of inequity in the distribution of platform support and resources among news publishers, with only a few becoming \\"platform darlings\\" while many others are left wondering about their future in a landscape where such deals might play a crucial role in sustaining journalistic endeavors."},{"instruction":"What were platform darlings in the pas","output":"In the past, \\"platform darlings\\" referred to content providers, businesses, or developers that were favored by major tech platforms such as Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon. These entities often received special treatment that could include increased visibility, promotion, additional funding opportunities, early access to new features, or other preferential support. In the context of social media, for example, a platform darling might be a particular influencer, media house, or content creator that a platform like Facebook or YouTube might promote more heavily in users' feeds due to the belief that this content drives more engagement or because of a partnership agreement. In the mobile app ecosystem, a platform darling could be an app developer that receives additional marketing support from Apple's App Store or Google Play Store, maybe because their apps are high quality, align with the platform's strategic interests, or provide a flagship experience that showcases the platform's capabilities. The concept of platform darlings isn't without controversy. Preferential treatment can lead to an unlevel playing field, where favored companies or individuals get disproportionate advantages, while others struggle to gain visibility or access the same resources. This can affect competition and innovation and raise questions about fairness and transparency in the digital economy. Critics argue that such practices can entrench the dominance of selected players and stifle the chances of smaller or independent entities to succeed."},{"instruction":"putty에서 x11을 받아서 windows에서 GUI를 보고 싶다. 방법을 아는가?

In your shoes for a new install, I would probably try using the VcXsrv before paying for Xming. – Zoredache Jan 27, 2017 at 23:05 1 @Zoredache, VcXsrv isn't as well known because It didn't get much popularity and thus mainly unknown, but could you test it out? – DanHolli Feb 8, 2017 at 16:56 1 for those of you who tried Xming, what kinds of bugs did you get? I just started using Xming on Win10, because I had somehow heard about Xming. Not sure whether I am headed for big headaches.. – alpha_989 Nov 4, 2017 at 14:40 You might try installing the base + X package of cygwin. It has an X server that is maintained and works well displaying X-apps from linux machines. I've been using it for a little over 15 years. The cygwin-X maintainer tries to keep it reasonably current with current releases and the cygwin is free. As far as I know, the Xming version was derived from the cygwin version in the distant past. I tried Xming, but had too many incompatibilities w/my environment and the dev refused to help when he found out I used cygwin... – Astara Mar 25, 2018 at 0:33 For me, I'm using Xmng of 2007, it worked out of the box (installation) on Windows 10. But I find the display not very clear, like my short-sighted eyes without classes. It usually worked with my emacs running in Ubuntu in Windows for a couple of hours, then the display may freeze, or the size may shrink when dragging to different monitors. I want to to try VcXsrv, but the installation requires local admin privilege, which is not convenient to get for me. – Yu Shen Feb 27, 2019 at 17:09 There is also X410, which is polished but paid software – Blake Jun 21, 2020 at 9:28 This comment is not a direct answer to the question but might help anyone looking for an answer to \\"What should I install on Windows 10/11 to display Linux GUI applications?\\": In recent WSL releases, Windows ships an X server: WSLg (github.com/microsoft/wslg). – CDuv Apr 16, 2023 at 12:32 Add a comment 2 Answers Sorted by: 58 VcXsrv is a open source project under GPLv3 license about building reliable X Server using Visual Studio in potentially optimal manner. It's common knowledge Microsoft Compilers are very good for Windows platform, since there are free variants it's tempting option. It was my first choice for X Server when I tried Windows Subsystem for Linux for the first time in Windows 10. Xming is a weird project which under term Donation hides a price for the installable binaries. I always though donations are voluntary, but it seems the author has different perception. This project was the only option to have X Server on Windows natively for very long time, but since we have VcXsrv, there is choice. I personally have very good experience with VcXsrc, it's easy to install and works very fast. I'm surprised it's not more popular. As far as I know their code is more clean version of original X server and doesn't relate to Cygwin.

Your \\"donation\\" should cover all future releases, but your credentials for downloading often \\"get's lost\\" and the support from the maintainer is flaky, so I have moved over to Vcxsrv and don't regret it. – thoni56 Jun 11, 2020 at 15:31 Add a comment 13 Both are compiled from modified X.org source code. VcXsrv handles screen-shots correctly when you Alt-Tab between windows, and puts proper icons in the task-bar. I haven't got that working with the Xming public domain version. Xming comes with more programs to start-up, VcXsrv relies on Xlaunch. On my Samsung Notebook 9 pen with Intel UHD 620 graphics, VcXsrv tries to do hardware acceleration by default, which doesn't work, don't know why. I had to unclick the option when running Xlaunch. Xming defaults straight to software OpenGL. I had trouble with both version switching monitors on a Surface Book. VcXsrv crashed, Xming just didn't display properly.","output":"아래는 주어진 내용을 정리한 것입니다. # Windows에서 X 서버의 차이점에 대한 질문 - **질문 일시**: 7년 전에 질문됨, 3년 6개월 전에 수정됨 - **조회수**: 56,000회 질문 내용: - Windows 10 Insider Preview를 사용 중이며, Windows Subsystem for Linux이 활성화되어 있음 - Ubuntu에서 Windows로 윈도우를 보기 위한 VcXsrv와 Xming의 차이점이 궁금함 - 설정의 명백한 차이점을 넘어서, 자원 사용량이 적은 프로그램과 한 프로그램에서는 작동하지 않지만 다른 프로그램에서는 작동하는 기능 등에 대한 구체적인 정보를 원함 관련 태그: - windows-10 - windows-10-preview - windows-subsystem-for-linux - x-server - xming 커뮤니티 의견 및 답변 요약: - Xming의 FOSS 버전은 거의 10년이 지난 오래된 버전으로, 버그가 있고 불안정할 수 있음 - VcXsrv는 약 6개월 전에 마지막으로 업데이트됨 - 유료 Xming은 최근에 빌드되었으며, 새로운 설치의 경우 VcXsrv를 사용해보는 것이 좋을 수 있음 - Cygwin에는 유지 관리되고 잘 작동하는 X 서버가 포함되어 있으며, Xming은 과거에 Cygwin 버전에서 파생됨 - X410은 유료이지만 세련된 소프트웨어임 - 최근 WSL 릴리스에서 Windows는 WSLg라는 자체 X 서버를 제공함 답변 요약: - VcXsrv는 Visual Studio를 사용하여 최적의 방식으로 신뢰할 수 있는 X 서버를 구축하는 GPLv3 라이선스의 오픈 소스 프로젝트임 - Xming은 설치 가능한 바이너리에 대한 접근을 제공하는 대가로 10 GBP의 고정 금액을 지불하는 \\"기부\\"라는 용어를 사용함 - VcXsrv는 설치가 쉽고 매우 빠르게 작동함 - VcXsrv는 Alt-Tab을 사용할 때 화면 캡처를 올바르게 처리하고 작업 표시줄에 적절한 아이콘을 표시함 - Xming은 시작 프로그램이 더 많고, VcXsrv는 Xlaunch에 의존함 - 일부 그래픽 문제로 인해 VcXsrv는 하드웨어 가속을 기본적으로 시도하지만 작동하지 않을 수 있으며, Xlaunch를 실행할 때 옵션을 해제해야 함 - 모니터 전환 시 VcXsrv는 충돌하고 Xming은 제대로 표시되지 않을 수 있음 이 내용은 원문의 핵심적인 정보를 요약하고 정리한 것으로, 질문의 본질과 커뮤니티의 주요 의견을 포함하고 있습니다."},{"instruction":"아이패드 셔터음을 어떻게 끌 수 있는가?

Elle chercherait à comprendre les lois physiques, les structures sociales, les personnages, les technologies et la magie spécifiques à cet univers. 2. **Création de la géographie et de l'environnement** : En utilisant des algorithmes de génération procédurale, l'AGI créerait des représentations de paysages, d'écosystèmes et de climats reflétant ceux rencontrés dans Dragon Ball. Elle tiendrait compte de lieux emblématiques tels que la capitale de la Terre, Kame House, les montagnes rocheuses, ainsi que des planètes fictives comme Namek ou Vegeta. 3. **Population du monde avec des races et des personnages** : L'AGI générerait des races et des personnages en se basant sur les spécifications de l'univers Dragon Ball. Les caractéristiques physiques, les costumes, les langues et les cultures seraient recréées avec une grande attention aux détails. Les personnages majeurs comme Goku, Vegeta, Bulma et les autres seraient modélisés avec leurs attributs et compétences uniques. 4. **Simulation des dynamiques sociales et des interactions** : L'AGI programmerait des comportements complexes, des alliances et des ennemis, des hiérarchies politiques et des événements basés sur les trames narratives de Dragon Ball. Elle tiendrait compte de la progression des personnages, des tournois d'arts martiaux, des quêtes pour les Dragon Balls, et des invasions extraterrestres. 5. **Génération d'événements et de scénarios** : L'AGI serait capable de créer de nouveaux scénarios et événements qui restent fidèles à l'esprit de Dragon Ball, tout en maintenant un degré de nouveauté et d'imprévisibilité pour les spectateurs ou les joueurs. 6. **Interaction en temps réel et modification** : Avec une AGI capable d'apprentissage continu, elle pourrait ajuster et améliorer l'univers généré en fonction des interactions des utilisateurs, de nouvelles informations ou des retours critiques, assurant ainsi une expérience dynamique et évolutive. Cependant, en pratique, il y a de nombreux défis à surmonter pour une AGI avant d'atteindre un tel niveau de sophistication.

Voici un aperçu de la façon dont une AGI pourrait procéder pour générer les villes, les lieux importants, et les personnages de Dragon Ball : **Création des villes et lieux importants :** 1. **Analyse du matériel de source** : L'AGI étudierait les informations disponibles sur les lieux emblématiques de Dragon Ball pour comprendre leur apparence, leur emplacement et leur rôle dans l'univers. 2. **Modélisation numérique** : En utilisant des techniques de modélisation 3D, l'AGI pourrait créer des représentations numériques de chaque lieu. Chaque ville et chaque bâtiment important, comme le Kame House (le fameux Dojo de Tortue Géniale), le Temple de Kami et le Palais de Baba, serait recréé fidèlement. 3. **Placement logique dans l'environnement** : L'AGI placerait ces lieux dans le monde de façon logique, en tenant compte de la géographie et de l'histoire du manga/anime. Par exemple, le Kame House serait situé sur une petite île isolée. **Création des personnages :** 1. **Conception physique et esthétique** : Pour les personnages principaux comme Goku, Vegeta et les autres, l'AGI utiliserait des données sur leur apparence pour créer des modèles numériques distincts, y compris leurs tenues caractéristiques et leurs traits physiques. 2. **Personnalité et comportement** : Les caractères et les traits de personnalité de chaque personnage seraient programmés pour refléter ceux établis dans l'œuvre originale. Par exemple, Goku serait dépeint comme courageux et insouciant, tandis que Vegeta aurait une fierté royale et une intense rivalité avec Goku. 3. **Pouvoirs et capacités** : Les pouvoirs et techniques spéciaux, comme le Kamehameha de Goku ou le Galick Gun de Vegeta, seraient reproduits dans le système. L'AGI prendrait également en compte les différents niveaux de pouvoir et d'évolution, comme les transformations en Super Saiyan. 4. **Génération de scénarios conflictuels** : Les ennemis de la série, y compris Vegeta (qui est initialement un antagoniste avant de devenir un allié), Cell, et Majin Buu, seraient modélisés avec leurs propres motivations et arcs narratifs. L'AGI pourrait créer des scénarios où ces antagonistes posent des défis à résoudre par les héros, fidèles à la dynamique de la série.

Supposons qu'une intelligence artificielle générale avancée (AGI) puisse être créée avec des capacités suffisantes pour la génération de contenu et la modélisation du monde. Dans ce cas, en théorie, cet AGI pourrait générer une simulation en temps réel très sophistiquée de l'univers de Dragon Ball. Voici une ventilation des résultats et des limites : **Résultat potentiel :** - Les utilisateurs pourraient explorer l'univers de Dragon Ball en trois dimensions, visitant des sites emblématiques et interagissant avec des environnements générés de manière dynamique. - Les personnages de l'univers, y compris Goku, Vegeta, et d'autres, auraient leurs propres IA pour la prise de décision et pourraient interagir avec l'utilisateur de manière cohérente avec leurs personnalités établies dans la série. - Les événements clés de l'histoire de Dragon Ball pourraient se dérouler en temps réel, et les utilisateurs pourraient avoir la possibilité d'intervenir ou d'influencer ces événements. - La simulation pourrait inclure un système de combat basé sur les arts martiaux et les capacités spéciales vues dans Dragon Ball, permettant aux utilisateurs de s'entraîner et de combattre comme les personnages de l'anime. **Limites :** - L'AGI devrait être extrêmement avancée pour gérer la complexité des nombreuses variables de l'univers de Dragon Ball, y compris la personnalité des personnages, les lois de la physique modifiées par des éléments fantastiques, et l'évolution des scénarios. - Les aspects techniques, tels que la résolution graphique, la modélisation physique, et les réponses comportementales en temps réel, exigeraient une puissance de calcul considérable. - L'authenticité par rapport à l'œuvre originale serait un défi majeur; l'AGI devrait non seulement reproduire fidèlement ce qui a déjà été créé mais aussi générer du nouveau contenu qui s'harmoniserait sans faille avec l'esprit et le style de la série. - Les questions de droits d'auteur et de propriété intellectuelle devraient être résolues pour permettre une telle simulation, en raison de la protection des œuvres originales et des restrictions d'utilisation commerciale. - L'interaction sociale avec des personnages IA pourrait être limitée par l'état actuel de la technologie en matière de compréhension et de génération du langage naturel. En résumé, bien que cette idée soit passionnante et correspond à l'ambition à long terme de la création de simulations de mondes fictifs, la réalité pratique d'atteindre un tel niveau de sophistication avec l'AGI est encore éloignée.

Par conséquent, nous ne pouvons que spéculer sur la puissance de calcul nécessaire. 2. **Complexité des tâches** : Les tâches à accomplir par l'AGI seraient immenses, incluant (mais sans s'y limiter) la simulation physique, la logique de décision des personnages, le rendu graphique en temps réel, la gestion des interactions multicouches et la cohérence narrative. Chacune de ces tâches est exigeante en termes de ressources informatiques. 3. **Optimisations futures** : L'efficacité des algorithmes et les avancées en matière de hardware informatique pourraient également réduire les exigences en puissance de calcul. Les technologies futures, comme le calcul quantique, pourraient jouer un rôle significatif. Pour donner un point de référence actuel, considérons les exigences en puissance de calcul pour les jeux vidéo AAA et les simulations en temps réel actuelles, qui sont déjà très élevées, généralement mesurées en teraflops (un teraflop équivalent à mille milliards d'opérations à virgule flottante par seconde). Les systèmes informatiques les plus puissants et les superordinateurs d'aujourd'hui opèrent à l'échelle des petaflops (un petaflop étant un quadrillion - mille billions - d'opérations à virgule flottante par seconde). Pour une simulation d'un univers fictif complexe comme Dragon Ball, on pourrait imaginer que des exaflops de puissance de calcul pourraient être nécessaires. Un exaflop est égal à un quintillion d'opérations à virgule flottante par seconde (ou 1 000 petaflops). Cela est nécessaire non seulement pour le traitement de l'intelligence artificielle mais aussi pour la simulation en temps réel des aspects physiques, visuels et interactifs. Gardez à l'esprit que cette estimation est hautement spéculative.

Le supercalculateur Fugaku au Japon, par exemple, était classé comme le plus rapide au monde selon la liste TOP500 de juin 2020, avec une performance de pointe d'environ 513,86 petaflops et une performance soutenue de 442 petaflops mesurés par le benchmark High Performance Linpack (HPL). L'objectif de l'exaflop est un point de repère important pour la recherche en superinformatique, et plusieurs projets sont en cours pour construire des superordinateurs qui dépasseront la barrière de l'exaflop dans les années 2020. Par exemple, le projet Aurora aux États-Unis prévoit initialement de livrer un superordinateur d'une capacité d'un exaflop, et la Chine a également annoncé avoir des plans de développement pour des ordinateurs capables d'exaflops. Atteindre et dépasser le seuil d'un exaflop est principalement motivé par des besoins croissants en calcul pour la simulation scientifique avancée, la modélisation climatique, la recherche en physique nucléaire, la génomique et, bien sûr, l'avancement de l'intelligence artificielle. Cependant, il est crucial de noter que la capacité à fournir une puissance de calcul d'un exaflop ne signifie pas nécessairement que celle-ci peut être directement appliquée à n'importe quelle tâche, telle que la simulation d'un univers fictif complexe comme Dragon Ball.

Ces exigences vont bien au-delà de ce qui est faisable ou souhaitable pour un appareil domestique. 2. **Coût** : Les superordinateurs de cette classe sont extrêmement coûteux, conçus pour des applications de recherche qui justifient de tels investissements. Il n'est pas économiquement viable d'intégrer cette technologie à des appareils destinés au grand public. 3. **Échelle de miniaturisation** : Les technologies actuelles de miniaturisation et de fabrication de silicium ont leurs limites physiques. Tandis que nous continuons à pousser les limites de la loi de Moore, il y a des barrières physiques et économiques à surmonter pour amener la puissance de calcul d'un exaflop sur des appareils grand public. 4. **Besoins en calcul** : La plupart des applications domestiques n'ont pas besoin de cette puissance de calcul. Les jeux vidéos, les applications multimédias, et même de nombreuses applications professionnelles fonctionnent parfaitement bien avec une fraction de cette puissance. Ce que nous pouvons nous attendre à voir, cependant, est l'utilisation accrue de services cloud qui mettent la puissance de calcul des superordinateurs à la disposition des consommateurs et des entreprises via Internet. Des services de calcul à haute performance (HPC as a Service) et des plateformes d'intelligence artificielle dans le cloud permettent déjà aux utilisateurs d'accéder à des ressources considérables pour des tâches spécifiques qui requièrent d'énormes quantités de traitement de données.

En théorie, si un fournisseur de services cloud avait un superordinateur d'exaflops dédié à des applications de jeu ou de simulation, les joueurs pourraient profiter de graphismes extrêmement détaillés, d'environnements de jeu dynamiques et complexes, et d'une intelligence artificielle très avancée qui pourrait améliorer considérablement l'expérience de jeu. Toutefois, voici quelques considérations pratiques importantes : 1. **Latence** : Le jeu via le cloud souffre souvent de problèmes de latence, c’est-à-dire du délai entre l'action du joueur et la réponse du jeu. Pour une expérience de jeu fluide, une connexion Internet très rapide et stable avec une faible latence est nécessaire. Cela peut être un défi, surtout dans les régions où l'accès Internet à haut débit n'est pas fiable. 2. **Bandwidth** : Les jeux en streaming de haute qualité peuvent consommer une grande quantité de bande passante. Cela peut poser problème pour les utilisateurs ayant des limites de données ou une connexion Internet lente. 3. **Coût** : Exécuter des applications sur des superordinateurs d'exaflops est extrêmement coûteux. Pour rendre cette technologie accessible via le cloud, le fournisseur de services doit pouvoir amortir ces coûts à travers un modèle économique qui reste abordable pour les consommateurs. 4. **Accessibilité** : Bien que vous puissiez théoriquement accéder à une puissance de calcul énorme grâce au cloud, en pratique, cette puissance est généralement partagée entre de nombreux utilisateurs simultanément, et non dédiée à un seul utilisateur ou jeu. 5. **Infrastructure Cloud** : Malgré les avancements dans l'infrastructure de cloud computing, il existe actuellement un écart entre la capacité théorique de calcul et la capacité à fournir cette puissance de manière efficace et cohérente à des millions d'utilisateurs simultanés. En conséquence, bien que le cloud gaming offre l'accès à une puissance de traitement supérieure à celle des consoles de jeux locales, il y a encore de nombreux obstacles pratiques et économiques à surmonter avant que l'on puisse streamer des jeux ou des simulations exploitant pleinement la puissance d'un superordinateur d'exaflops."},{"instruction":"토미 로렌스에 대해서 알려주세요","output":"토미 로렌스(Tomi Lahren)는 미국의 보수적인 정치 해설가, 뉴스 앵커, 그리고 텔레비전 호스트입니다. 그녀는 1992년 8월 11일에 태어나 라피드 시티(Rapid City), 사우스 다코타(South Dakota)에서 자랐습니다. 로렌스는 대학에서 방송 저널리즘을 공부하고 political science에 경지를 세웠습니다. 로렌스의 주요 특징 중 하나는 그녀의 논란을 불러일으키는 발언과 대담한 발언으로 인해 어린 나이부터 큰 주목을 받았다는 점입니다. 그녀의 커리어는 블레이즈(TheBlaze) 네트워크에서 '토미(Tomi)'라는 자체 이름의 쇼를 호스팅하면서 주로 인기를 끌었습니다. 이 쇼에서 그녀는 종종 이민, 건축, 국방 등에 관련된 보수적 관점을 표현하며 유명한 \\"Final Thoughts\\" 세그먼트를 통해 자신의 의견을 단호하게 주장했습니다. 그녀의 의견은 종종 많은 사람들에게 호응을 얻음과 동시에 부정적인 반응을 불러일으키기도 했습니다. 로렌스는 논쟁적이고 때때로 분열적인 주제에 대해 목소리를 높이면서 소셜 미디어에서 큰 팔로워층을 얻었으며, 보수적인 정치 코멘테이터로서의 입지를 공고히 했습니다. 2017년에 그녀는 낙태에 대한 의견 표현 때문에 TheBlaze와의 관계가 악화되었으며 결국 해당 네트워크를 떠났습니다. 그 후 그녀는 폭스 뉴스와 관련된 여러 역할을 맡으며 그곳에서도 계속 활동해왔습니다. 로렌스는 여러 미디어 플랫폼에서 자신의 의견을 전파하고 다양한 텔레비전 쇼에 출연하는 등 활발하게 활동하고 있습니다."},{"instruction":"아뇨 축구선수요","output":"죄송합니다, 제가 잘못된 정보를 제공했습니다. 축구에 관한 질문이었군요. 토미 로렌스는 레이턴 오리엔트 FC에서 선수 경력을 시작하여 수비수로써 일하던 팀의 골키퍼 문제를 해결하기 위해 골키퍼로 전환했습니다. 그의 경력에는 리버풀 FC에서의 탁월한 플레이가 포함되며, 이 기간 동안 그는 여러 트로피를 들어 올리며 팀의 역사적인 선수 중 한 명으로 기록되었습니다. 로렌스의 골키퍼로서의 성과는 그를 1960년대와 1970년대의 최고 선수 중 한 사람으로 만들었습니다. 그는 또한 웨일즈 국가대표팀의 일원으로 활동하며 국제 무대에서도 명성을 쌓았습니다. 일반적으로 그는 견고함과 일관성으로 알려져 있으며, 그의 경력 동안 탁월한 리더십과 경기 관리 능력을 보여주었습니다. 은퇴 후에도 로렌스는 축구 코치와 해설가로 활동하며 축구 분야에 기여를 계속했습니다."},{"instruction":"What?

Podemos pensar en la hemoglobina como pequeños camiones que llevan oxígeno a todas las células que lo necesitan para funcionar correctamente. La hemoglobina tiene la capacidad de unirse al oxígeno gracias a un componente que contiene hierro. Cuando respiramos, el oxígeno del aire entra a nuestros pulmones y allí la hemoglobina se encarga de recogerlo y distribuirlo. Por ejemplo, después de hacer ejercicio, tus músculos necesitan más oxígeno para recuperarse y seguir funcionando. La hemoglobina asegura que ese oxígeno llegue a ellos rápidamente. Es importante también saber que hay un nivel saludable de hemoglobina que debe tener la sangre. Si la hemoglobina es demasiado baja, una condición conocida como anemia, nuestros órganos y tejidos no reciben suficiente oxígeno, lo que puede hacernos sentir cansados o débiles. Por otro lado, si hay demasiada hemoglobina, la sangre puede volverse demasiado viscosa y dificultar la circulación, lo cual puede ser peligroso."},{"instruction":"que aportes tiene la hemoglobina en nuestra salud?","output":"La hemoglobina tiene varios aportes importantes para nuestra salud: 1. Transporte de oxígeno: La función principal de la hemoglobina es transportar oxígeno desde los pulmones a todas las partes del cuerpo. Sin un suministro adecuado de oxígeno, las células corporales no pueden funcionar de manera óptima. 2. Transporte de dióxido de carbono: Además de transportar oxígeno, la hemoglobina ayuda a recoger el dióxido de carbono, un desecho producido por las células, y lo lleva de vuelta a los pulmones para ser exhalado. 3. Regulación del pH sanguíneo: La hemoglobina juega un papel en la regulación del pH de la sangre al unirse a los iones de hidrógeno y así ayudar a mantener un equilibrio ácido-base adecuado en nuestro cuerpo. 4. Efecto tampón: La hemoglobina contribuye a la capacidad tampón de la sangre, lo que significa que ayuda a estabilizar el pH frente a la adición de ácidos o bases. 5. Transporte de nutrientes y hormonas: Aunque su función principal es transportar oxígeno, la hemoglobina también puede unirse a otras moléculas como el óxido nítrico (NO). El óxido nítrico desempeña funciones importantes en la dilatación de los vasos sanguíneos y en el control de la circulación sanguínea. Una cantidad adecuada de hemoglobina es esencial para mantener estos procesos y asegurar que el cuerpo funcione correctamente. Tener niveles de hemoglobina fuera del rango normal puede llevar a problemas de salud, tales como fatiga y debilidad (en caso de niveles bajos, típicamente observados en la anemia) o complicaciones como trombosis (en caso de niveles altos). Por ello, mantener niveles saludables de hemoglobina es vital para nuestra salud general."},{"instruction":"vale, pero que aporte tiene a nuestra salud, osea en que ayuda, por ejemplo ayuda al sistema nervioso o ayuda a mejorar las defensas o ayuda a mejorar los problemas resporatiorios, de ese estilo","output":"Entiendo tu pregunta. La hemoglobina, al transportar oxígeno y contribuir al transporte de dióxido de carbono, impacta directa e indirectamente en varios aspectos de nuestra salud: 1. **Salud celular y energética**: Al entregar oxígeno a las células de todo el cuerpo, la hemoglobina es esencial para la producción de energía en las células. Cada célula utiliza oxígeno para convertir nutrientes (como los azúcares) en energía, un proceso conocido como respiración celular. 2. **Función muscular**: El oxígeno que la hemoglobina transporta es vital para la función muscular. Durante el ejercicio, la demanda de oxígeno por parte de los músculos aumenta significativamente, y una adecuada cantidad de hemoglobina asegura que los músculos reciban el oxígeno que necesitan para mantener su actividad y prevenir la fatiga rápida. 3. **Salud cerebral y función cognitiva**: El cerebro es particularmente dependiente del oxígeno y consume aproximadamente el 20% del oxígeno que utilizamos. La hemoglobina es crucial para mantener las funciones cerebrales, incluidas la cognición, la atención y el procesamiento de información. Los niveles adecuados de hemoglobina ayudan a asegurar que el cerebro funcione correctamente y mantenga su salud. 4. **Función cardiovascular**: Al transportar oxígeno y facilitar la eliminación del dióxido de carbono, la hemoglobina es importante para mantener un sistema cardiovascular saludable. La dilatación de los vasos sanguíneos mediada por el óxido nítrico ayuda a regular la presión arterial. 5. **Sistema inmunológico**: Aunque la hemoglobina no desempeña un papel directo en el sistema inmunológico como las células inmunitarias, todos los sistemas del cuerpo, incluido el sistema inmunológico, dependen del oxígeno que la hemoglobina entrega para su funcionamiento óptimo. 6. **Problemas respiratorios**: La hemoglobina ayuda a mitigar los problemas respiratorios al asegurarse de que incluso con una disminución en la capacidad pulmonar, el oxígeno pueda ser transportado eficientemente a través de la sangre. En resumen, la hemoglobina apoya directamente la función y la salud de prácticamente todos los sistemas del cuerpo, garantizando que las células tengan el oxígeno necesario para realizar sus funciones vitales y contribuyendo en la eliminación de productos de desecho como el dióxido de carbono. Un nivel adecuado de hemoglobina es vital para mantener una buena salud y soporte a la funcionalidad de diversos órganos y sistemas."},{"instruction":"vale, y que cosas ayudan al sistema inmune","output":"Varios factores pueden ayudar a fortalecer tu sistema inmunitario y mantenerlo funcionando de manera óptima.

Generally, the game is paused by setting \`Time.timeScale\` to \`0\`, which stops everything that relies on time, such as physics and animation. However, UI animations that should continue playing can be managed differently, by using unscaled time. Here's a general approach to implement this: 1. **Pausing the game:** To pause the game, set \`Time.timeScale\` to \`0\`. This will stop all gameplay, physics, and anything that relies on scaled time. \`\`\`csharp public void PauseGame() { Time.timeScale = 0f; // Pause other game elements if necessary } \`\`\` 2. **Playing menu animations:** When using the Unity Animator for your menu animations, you can set it to ignore the time scale by changing the \`updateMode\` of the Animator component. Set it to \`AnimatorUpdateMode.UnscaledTime\`. This can be done in the animator component's settings in the Unity Editor, or via script: \`\`\`csharp public Animator menuAnimator; private void Start() { // Assuming the Animator component is attached to the same GameObject menuAnimator = GetComponent<Animator>(); menuAnimator.updateMode = AnimatorUpdateMode.UnscaledTime; } \`\`\` If you are using \`Animation\` instead of \`Animator\`, unfortunately, there is no built-in option to play animations with unscaled time. You might need to manually update the animation using \`AnimationState\`'s \`normalizedTime\`, based on \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\`. 3. **Resuming the game:** To resume the game, set \`Time.timeScale\` back to its default value of \`1\`. \`\`\`csharp public void ResumeGame() { Time.timeScale = 1f; // Resume other game elements if necessary } \`\`\` 4. **Handling UI elements and Coroutines:** - For anything reliant on time, like fading effects or moving UI elements, be sure that they are using \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` instead of \`Time.deltaTime\`. - For coroutines that you need to keep running during pause, make sure they aren't using \`WaitForSeconds\`, which is affected by the time scale. Instead, use \`WaitForSecondsRealtime\` or implement your own timing using \`Time.unscaledTime\`. Keep in mind that pausing the game this way will still disable other features that rely on \`Time.timeScale\` (like \`Rigidbody\` components). If you need to pause game logic while keeping physics active, you must implement a custom solution to pause your game logic without actually setting the \`Time.timeScale\` to zero. This may involve setting flags to halt processing of input and update loops manually."},{"instruction":"But my menu animations work with time.deltatime","output":"If your menu animations are scripted and rely on \`Time.deltaTime\`, you will need to modify the scripts so that they use \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` instead when the game is paused. \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` continues to update correctly even when \`Time.timeScale\` is set to 0. Here's a basic example to illustrate this: Let's say you have a script that moves a UI element across the screen and you want to keep it moving even when the game is paused. Normally, the update loop might look something like this: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { float movementSpeed = 5.0f; transform.Translate(Vector3.right * movementSpeed * Time.deltaTime); } \`\`\` To make the animation continue when the game is paused, simply replace \`Time.deltaTime\` with \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\`: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { float movementSpeed = 5.0f; // Use unscaled delta time for movement so it continues even when the game is paused (timeScale is set to 0). transform.Translate(Vector3.right * movementSpeed * Time.unscaledDeltaTime); } \`\`\` This will ensure that the menu animations continue to play at the correct speed, even when you pause the game by setting \`Time.timeScale\` to 0. Remember to do this for every script that controls a menu animation if you want those animations to be unaffected by the game pause. For more complex animations such as fades, scales, or anything else controlled by deltaTime in a script, perform similar adjustments to replace \`Time.deltaTime\` with \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\`. If you are using Unity's built-in animation system or Animator component with an Animator Controller for the UI, you don't need to worry, because animations in Animator can be set to run unaffected by the time scale by changing their \`Update Mode\` to \`Unscaled Time\` in the Inspector as I mentioned earlier. But if you've added manual interpolation in scripts that use \`Time.deltaTime\`, those will need to be updated with \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` as well."},{"instruction":"Differences between delta.time and unscaleddelta time","output":"\`Time.deltaTime\` and \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` are two time measurement variables provided by Unity's \`Time\` class that are used to manage time and frame rates within a game. They are crucial for ensuring smooth motion and time-based calculations regardless of frame rate variations. Here are the key differences between them: **Time.deltaTime:** - Measures the time in seconds it took to complete the last frame (i.e., the time between the current frame and the previous frame). - It's affected by the \`Time.timeScale\` property. If \`Time.timeScale\` is set to 1.0 (default), \`deltaTime\` reflects real time. If it's set to 0.5, \`deltaTime\` is half the real time; if it's set to 0, \`deltaTime\` is also 0, effectively pausing any action that relies on it. - This is commonly used for most time-based calculations in gameplay mechanics, such as moving objects, animations, timers, etc. Example usage: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { float speed = 5.0f; transform.position += Vector3.right * speed * Time.deltaTime; } \`\`\` **Time.unscaledDeltaTime:** - Also measures the time in seconds it took to complete the last frame, but, unlike \`Time.deltaTime\`, \`unscaledDeltaTime\` is unaffected by \`Time.timeScale\`. - It's useful for time calculations that you want to continue even when the game is paused or when you're using \`Time.timeScale\` for slow-motion effects. - Ideal for UI animations, real-time clocks, or any game elements that should not be affected by the scaling of time. Example usage: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { float speed = 5.0f; transform.position += Vector3.right * speed * Time.unscaledDeltaTime; } \`\`\` By using \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\`, you ensure that the speed variable truly represents units per second in real time, regardless of what \`Time.timeScale\` is set to. In summary, the primary difference is that \`Time.deltaTime\` respects \`Time.timeScale\`, making it suitable for in-game mechanics that should be paused or slowed down, while \`Time.unscaledDeltaTime\` is ideal for things that need to run in real time, like menu animations or timers, even when the gameplay itself is paused or slowed."},{"instruction":"Write a reply to this Craigslist as","output":"I'm sorry, but it seems there's a piece of information missing in your request.

C'est une mesure de la puissance de calcul extrêmement élevée, qui, à l'heure actuelle, n'est atteinte que par les superordinateurs les plus avancés. En ce qui concerne les appareils grand public, plusieurs facteurs rendent improbable l'atteinte d'une puissance de calcul d'un exaflop dans un avenir proche : 1. **Puissance et refroidissement** : Une puissance de calcul aussi élevée nécessite des systèmes de refroidissement très sophistiqués pour dissiper la chaleur générée. Les appareils grand public ne sont pas conçus pour gérer une telle dissipation thermique. 2. **Consommation d'énergie** : Les supercalculateurs fonctionnent à des niveaux de puissance très élevés qui ne sont pas viables pour les appareils alimentés par batterie ou même les appareils domestiques ordinaires en termes de consommation d'énergie. 3. **Espace** : Les systèmes exaflop actuels utilisent des installations massives avec des centaines ou des milliers de serveurs interconnectés. La miniaturisation à l'échelle nécessaire pour les appareils grand public représente un défi technique énorme. 4. **Coût** : Le coût de ces superordinateurs est prohibitif, s'élevant à des centaines de millions, voire des milliards de dollars. Les économies d'échelle associées à la production de masse d'appareils grand public exigent un point de prix beaucoup plus bas. 5. **Nécessité pratique** : La plupart des applications grand public ne nécessitent pas une telle puissance de calcul. Les jeux vidéo avancés, le traitement d'image, ou même l'IA sur les appareils grand public pourraient tirer profit de plus de puissance de calcul, mais même dans ces cas, les besoins sont très éloignés de l'exaflop. Cela étant dit, les progrès technologiques continuent de surprendre et il est difficile de prévoir exactement ce que l'avenir réserve à long terme. La loi de Moore, qui prédit une augmentation exponentielle de la puissance de calcul, a ralenti et les chercheurs explorent de nouvelles architectures informatiques, telles que l'informatique quantique et les réseaux neuronaux, qui pourraient potentiellement aboutir à des formes de calcul très puissantes et efficientes énergétiquement. Cependant, même avec de telles avancées, il est peu probable que nous voyions des capacités exaflop dans les appareils grand public dans un avenir immédiat."},{"instruction":"Dirai 2030","output":"Prédire la technologie disponible en 2030 est un exercice spéculatif. Cependant, sur la base des tendances actuelles en matière de progression matérielle et technologique, il est très peu probable que les appareils grand public atteignent la capacité de calcul exaflops d'ici à 2030. Voici quelques raisons pour cela : 1. **Demande Utilisateur** : Les applications grand public n'exigent pas actuellement de tels niveaux de puissance de calcul. Les jeux vidéo, le montage vidéo, et l'IA grand public deviennent plus exigeants en termes de puissance de traitement, mais même des avancées significatives dans ces domaines ne nécessiteraient probablement pas un exaflop de puissance de calcul. 2. **Progrès Technologiques** : Même en tenant compte de l'innovation rapide dans les domaines des semi-conducteurs, tels que les transistors à effet de champ en nitrure de gallium (GaN) ou les transistors à effet de champ en nitrure de silicium (SiC), ou dans des domaines émergents comme l'informatique quantique, les progrès ne semblent pas se diriger vers des appareils individuels avec une puissance de calcul d'exaflops. L'innovation tend plutôt à intégrer davantage de fonctionnalités à une puissance de calcul augmentant de manière plus modeste et à une efficacité énergétique améliorée. 3. **Consommation d'Énergie et Dissipation Thermique** : Les limites actuelles de la consommation d'énergie et de la dissipation de la chaleur rendraient improbable l'utilisation d'une puissance de calcul exaflops dans un environnement domestique ordinaire, sans parler d’un appareil portable comme un smartphone ou un ordinateur portable. 4. **Coût et Fabrication** : La fabrication de dispositifs de calcul d'une telle puissance à un coût accessible pour les consommateurs présente des défis immenses. Des économies d’échelle seraient nécessaires ainsi que des avancées considérables en matière de technologie. En revanche, nous pourrions voir des avancées telles que : - **Data Centers en Cloud et Périphériques** : Une utilisation plus répandue de l'informatique en cloud, où les dispositifs grand public utilisent la puissance de calcul de serveurs distants, pourrait permettre d'accéder ponctuellement à des capacités de traitement comparables à des superordinateurs. - **Processeurs Spécialisés** : Des puces spécialisées pour le machine learning et l'informatique graphique pourraient continuer à voir des gains de performance substantiels. - **Informatique Évolutive** : De meilleures interconnexions et l'utilisation de clusters de plusieurs appareils pourraient, théoriquement, offrir aux consommateurs une meilleure puissance de calcul répartie. - **Informatique Quantique et Avancée** : Les avancées dans ces domaines pourraient changer radicalement la donne en matière de puissance de calcul, mais il est peu probable qu'elles soient intégrées dans des appareils grand public d'ici 2030. En résumé, même si les appareils grand public deviendront certainement plus puissants d'ici 2030, atteindre les niveaux de puissance de calcul des exaflops reste improbable pour des appareils d'usage quotidien. L'accès à ces niveaux de puissance se fera probablement via des ressources partagées ou des services en cloud plutôt que par des appareils locaux."},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a topic, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"Comedians who play Japanese host bar players in Korea are also very popular in Japan, and comedians who play Filipino in Korea are now being criticized in the Philippines. And now only comedians who play Filipino are being criticized in Korea. Why do they have different reactions?","output":"The differing reactions to comedians playing characters of different nationalities can be attributed to several factors, including cultural context, the history of the portrayals, sensitivity towards racial and ethnic stereotyping, and the current socio-political climate in the countries involved. 1. **Cultural Context and Acceptance**: In the case of Japanese host bar player characters being popular in both Korea and Japan, it might be that the representation is seen as more culturally respectful, humorous, or relatable within both societies. Perhaps these portrayals are not grounded in negative stereotypes and are instead viewed as a light-hearted and acceptable form of entertainment. 2. **Historical Relations**: Japan and Korea share a complicated history, but the entertainment sphere often transcends these tensions. If the comedy skits featuring Japanese host bar players are not touching on historical sensitivities and are instead based on contemporary observations, they may be received with less controversy. 3. **Racial and Ethnic Sensitivities**: The criticism of comedians playing Filipino characters in Korea by Filipinos may be rooted in concerns over racial or ethnic stereotyping. If the portrayal of Filipinos perpetuates negative stereotypes, ridicules their culture, or presents a caricature that is demeaning in some way, it is likely to incite disapproval and criticism, especially from the Filipino community and others sensitive to such issues. 4. **Socio-political Climate**: The present socio-political environment in the countries involved can significantly influence how such portrayals are received. Societies are becoming more aware and less tolerant of insensitive racial and ethnic portrayals, leading to increased scrutiny of comedians and actors who perform characters that are seen as perpetuating stereotypes or mocking a particular group's identity. 5. **Globalization and Media Influence**: The global media landscape allows for immediate and widespread sharing of content across cultures. When a portrayal is deemed offensive in one context, it can quickly gain international attention and be subject to the standards and values of a broader audience, leading to different reactions in different countries. 6. **Diaspora and Community Impact**: The reaction within Korea might be different due to the presence and influence of the Filipino community in South Korea. If the local Filipino community and their Korean supporters voice concerns over the comedy portrayals, it could lead to more intense criticism within Korea compared to Japan. It's important to note that these explanations are speculative and there could be other circumstances and dynamics influencing the different reactions in Japan, the Philippines, and Korea. Additionally, reactions can vary widely even within a single country and depend on numerous factors, including specific content, portrayal intention, delivery, and audience interpretation."},{"instruction":"That's too textbook-like an answer.","output":"I see you're looking for a more nuanced response. Here are a few reasons for different reactions: 1. **Cultural Sensitivity**: In Japan, the portrayal of Japanese host bar players by Korean comedians might not hit any sensitive notes and could be seen as an inside joke or even a form of flattery, as it may focus on a subculture without negative connotations. In contrast, when comedians in Korea portray Filipinos, it could be relying on cultural stereotypes, which might be viewed as offensive or derogative. 2. **Expectations and Representation**: Japanese audiences might have different expectations when it comes to how they're represented in Korean media. They might be more tolerant if the portrayal aligns with their self-image or if the act is done by a well-liked comedian. Filipinos might feel that they are often misrepresented or stereotyped in media; therefore, they might have a lower tolerance for such portrayals. 3. **Current Social Issues**: If there are current tensions or social issues related to the Filipino community in Korea, portrayals of Filipinos that are perceived as mocking or insensitive can become a flashpoint for criticism. Conversely, if there are positive relations or no significant issues between Japan and Korea, the comedic portrayals might fly under the radar. 4. **Public Perception and Advocacy**: The level of advocacy and activism regarding racial and ethnic representation in media can greatly influence reactions. If there’s a strong movement in the Philippines against racial stereotyping, similar comedic acts might quickly draw criticism. 5. **Media Spotlight**: Sometimes the reaction may simply be down to which act caught media attention and public scrutiny first, creating a domino effect of awareness and criticism. In a nutshell, the reaction to comedians portraying different nationalities hinges on a complex interplay of factors including cultural sensitivity, the current state of diplomatic relations, community activism, and the potential for negative stereotyping or misrepresentation."},{"instruction":"The Film your writing about: The Blob During the Cold War, many films appeared in Hollywood that depicted the fears in American society towards the Soviet Union and their developing technologies.

Yeaworth Jr. The film's plot unfurls in a small American town that becomes besieged by a strange, alien life-form. This entity, which is essentially a gelatinous, amoeba-like mass, arrives on Earth via a meteorite. The central characters are teenager Steve Andrews (played by Steve McQueen in his first starring role) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut). After an old man discovers the meteorite and pokes it with a stick, the blob attaches to his hand. Steve and Jane find the man and take him to a doctor, where the blob consumes both the man and the doctor. As the film progresses, the blob grows larger with each person it consumes. Tension builds as the teenagers struggle to warn the skeptical townsfolk about the amorphous menace. Despite their best efforts, the blob engulfs a diner, trapping the protagonists and a handful of townspeople inside. The climax erupts as they fight for survival, ultimately discovering that the creature recoils from cold. The resolution involves the air force dropping a freeze bomb that solidifies the blob. The film concludes with the creature being airlifted to the Arctic, ominously hinting at a possible reawakening should it thaw, with the final words on screen: \\"The End?\\" Paragraph Two: In the context of its release during the height of the Cold War, \\"The Blob\\" can be interpreted as an embodiment of American anxieties surrounding the unknown implications of the Arms Race and Space Race. The film opens with a creature from outer space, reflecting the fear of invasion—either ideologically or literally—by foreign powers and the unknown threats of technology and exploration. This mirrors real-world dread about what Soviet space technology could mean for the balance of power. The blob itself, an insatiable consumer that grows in mass and power with every victim, symbolizes the all-encompassing threat posed by nuclear armament and mutually assured destruction. The unstoppable nature of the blob could represent the seemingly uncontrollable escalation of the Arms Race, with each superpower rapidly amassing a destructive capability that could engulf the world, much like the blob threatens to consume the town. The use of a cold weapon to stop the blob may subtly reflect the hopes pinned on containment and de-escalation strategies, as invoked by the US to stop the spread of communism during the Cold War. The film's final scene, with the blob being transported and stored in the Arctic, suggests that while the immediate danger has been averted, the threat remains, as did the enduring tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, frozen but not resolved."},{"instruction":"La Chine vise une puissance de calcul de 300 exaflops malgré l’opposition américaine et cela pose des questions","output":"La Chine visant une puissance de calcul de 300 exaflops, malgré l'opposition américaine, est significatif à plusieurs égards et soulève effectivement de nombreuses questions. Voici quelques points concernant cette ambition et les implications potentielles. # Puissance de calcul des superordinateurs : 1. **Niveau Technique** : 300 exaflops correspondent à 300 quintillions d'opérations par seconde, un niveau de puissance de calcul extrêmement élevé qui est plusieurs ordres de grandeur supérieur aux superordinateurs actuels. Atteindre cet objectif nécessitera d'énormes avancées technologiques et pourrait conduire à des percées dans de nombreux domaines, tels que la modélisation climatique, la pharmacologie, la recherche en intelligence artificielle, etc. 2. **Souveraineté Technologique** : En visant cet objectif, la Chine exprime sa volonté d'atteindre l'indépendance technologique et de ne pas être freinée par les restrictions imposées par d'autres pays, principalement les États-Unis, qui ont mis en place des contrôles à l'exportation sur des technologies clés. # Impact des Restrictions Américaines : 1. **Course à l'armement technologique** : Les États-Unis ont des préoccupations sécuritaires concernant la montée en puissance technologique de la Chine, en particulier pour des applications militaires potentielles. Cela alimente une sorte de course aux armements technologiques, avec des implications géopolitiques et stratégiques significatives. 2. **Chaîne d'Approvisionnement** : Les restrictions américaines pourraient pousser la Chine à développer davantage ses propres chaînes d'approvisionnement en matière de technologies avancées et composants électroniques, contribuant ainsi à une déglobalisation partielle du secteur technologique. # Conséquences Géopolitiques et Économiques : 1. **Sécurité Nationale** : Le contrôle et l'avantage dans les technologies de superordinateurs sont considérés comme des enjeux majeurs de sécurité nationale, car ils permettent des avancées dans le domaine de la cryptographie et de la cyber-sécurité. 2. **Leadership Technologique** : La position de leader mondial dans la construction de superordinateurs est aussi symbolique d'une suprématie technologique et économique. Si la Chine atteint cet objectif, cela pourrait redéfinir l'équilibre du pouvoir technologique mondial. 3. **Course Technologique Globale** : L’initiative de la Chine peut stimuler une compétition globale pour le développement de superordinateurs encore plus puissants, ce qui pourrait accélérer l'innovation technologique mais aussi accentuer les tensions internationales. # Questions Éthiques et Sociétales : 1. **Utilisation des Technologies** : L'utilisation de superordinateurs à des fins militaires, pour la surveillance ou le contrôle de la population, pose des questions éthiques importantes quant à la gouvernance de ces technologies. 2. **Accessibilité** : Comment ces technologies vont-elles bénéficier au grand public et contribuer au progrès de la société dans son ensemble, et non seulement servir les ambitions étatiques ou militaires? 3. **Collaborations Internationales** : Quel est l'avenir des collaborations internationales dans la recherche et l'innovation en présence de telles oppositions politiques? Il est clair que les ambitions technologiques de la Chine et la réaction des États-Unis sont des sujets complexes qui s'entremêlent avec la politique, l'économie et les avancées techniques, avec des conséquences qui vont bien au-delà du simple développement de l'informatique à haute performance."},{"instruction":"Malgré les sanctions et d’importantes contraintes, la Chine annonce qu’elle compte doubler sa puissance de calcul pour atteindre 300 exaflops dès 2025. Une information qui interroge.","output":"L'annonce de la Chine visant à doubler sa puissance de calcul pour atteindre le seuil de 300 exaflops d'ici à 2025, malgré les sanctions internationales et notamment les restrictions imposées par les États-Unis, a effectivement de quoi susciter des interrogations. Voici différents aspects sur lesquels cette annonce peut porter à réflexion : 1. **Technologie de pointe** : Atteindre 300 exaflops constituerait une réalisation technologique majeure. Cela impliquerait le développement de technologies de calcul avancées, des processeurs extrêmement rapides, et une efficacité énergétique sans précédent. Étant donné que les superordinateurs les plus puissants actuels atteignent l'ordre de l'exaflop, un tel bond serait remarquable. 2. **Défis de l'autonomie technologique** : Étant donné que les États-Unis ont imposé des sanctions qui limitent l'accès de la Chine à certains composants clés et technologies avancées, cette annonce indique une forte volonté de la part de la Chine d'accroître son autonomie dans le domaine technologique. Cela pourrait encourager le développement de l'industrie intérieure chinoise dans les secteurs de la semi-conducteur et du matériel informatique. 3. **Applications potentielles** : Une puissance de calcul aussi énorme aura des implications dans de nombreux domaines, incluant la recherche scientifique (telle que la simulation de phénomènes physiques complexes), la médecine personnalisée, la conception de matériaux avancés, et potentiellement l'intelligence artificielle. Mais cela soulève aussi des questions concernant les usages militaires et de surveillance, aspects qui pourraient inquiéter d'autres nations. 4. **Dynamique géopolitique** : Cette annonce peut être vue comme une déclaration stratégique de la Chine affirmant sa détermination à ne pas être entravée par la pression internationale. Elle pourrait ainsi accélérer une « course aux superordinateurs » similaire à la course aux armements. 5. **Riposte internationale** : Comment réagiront les États-Unis et leurs alliés à cette annonce ? Cela pourrait-il entraîner un renforcement des sanctions ou, au contraire, une tentative de rapprochement pour éviter une escalade de la tension technologique ? 6. **Impact environnemental** : Les superordinateurs consomment de grandes quantités d'énergie. La création d'un superordinateur de 300 exaflops soulève des questions écologiques quant à la source de cette énergie et la façon dont les impacts environnementaux seront gérés. 7. **Viabilité et réalisme** : Il y a lieu de s'interroger sur le caractère réaliste de l'objectif fixé par la Chine pour 2025, compte tenu des défis technologiques et des sanctions existantes. Ces points montrent que les implications de l'annonce de la Chine vont bien au-delà des aspects techniques et concernent aussi la sécurité internationale, l'économie mondiale, l'innovation technologique, ainsi que la gestion environnementale. La poursuite des développements sur cette affaire fournira probablement de plus amples informations sur la progression de la Chine vers cet objectif ambitieux et sur l'évolution de l'équilibre international dans le domaine de la technologie de superordinateur."},{"instruction":"What did constipated people do in ancient times when there were no modern treatments available?","output":"In ancient times, people relied on natural remedies and dietary practices to help with constipation and other digestive issues. Here are some methods that were used: 1. **Dietary Changes**: Just like today, consuming fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were known to help maintain regular bowel movements. 2. **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water was recognized as important for preventing and alleviating constipation. 3. **Exercise**: Physical activity was encouraged to help stimulate intestinal movements. 4. **Herbal Remedies**: Various herbs and plants were used for their laxative effects. For example, senna, aloe, rhubarb, and cascara were known for their bowel-stimulating properties. 5. **Massage**: Abdominal massages might have been used to help stimulate the intestines and relieve constipation. 6. **Suppositories**: Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, used suppositories made from substances like soap and various oils to provoke bowel movements. 7. **Enemas**: Enemas have been used since ancient times, with evidence from cultures such as the Egyptians, who used them for various health treatments, including constipation. These were administered using devices made with materials available at the time, such as animal bladders and reeds. 8. **Lifestyle Changes**: Recommendations might have included stress reduction and better sleep, as these factors can also affect digestion. 9. **Squatting**: The use of squatting positions for defecation was common before the advent of modern toilets. This position can help facilitate bowel movements by aligning the rectum in a way that reduces strain. 10. **Manual Removal**: In severe cases, manual removal of impactions may have been performed, though this would likely have been a last resort due to the risk of injury and infection. It should be noted that these methods varied with time and culture, and not all ancient peoples would have had access to the same types of treatments. Also, the understanding of how these treatments worked was based on the medical knowledge and beliefs of the time, which could include a mix of empirical observations and mythological or philosophical explanations."},{"instruction":"What if none of those worked?","output":"If none of the non-invasive methods worked to alleviate constipation in ancient times, the options were limited and could be quite uncomfortable or even dangerous by modern standards. Here are a few additional steps that might have been taken in severe cases: 1. **Stronger Laxatives**: Practitioners might have resorted to more potent herbal or mineral purgatives. Some of these substances could be toxic and cause serious side effects, so they were likely used with caution. 2. **Phlebotomy or Bloodletting**: In some ancient medical practices, such as those informed by the humoral theory of ancient Greek medicine, bloodletting was used to treat a variety of ailments. It was believed that removing a certain amount of blood could restore balance within the body. 3. **Surgical Intervention**: In extreme cases, if impaction was severe and life-threatening, some form of primitive surgical intervention might have been attempted, though this would have been a last resort due to the high risk of infection and lack of proper anesthetics and antiseptics. 4. **Fasting or Dietary Restriction**: Sometimes, withholding food for a time was thought to reset the digestive system or allow it to clear the obstruction. 5. **Incantations and Rituals**: In societies where medical practice was closely tied to spiritual beliefs, certain rituals or incantations might have been performed in an attempt to relieve constipation, particularly if it was thought to have a supernatural cause. 6. **Travel to Healing Shrines**: In some cultures, those suffering from intractable illnesses would travel to healing shrines or holy sites, where they would pray or undergo ritual treatments in the hopes of a miraculous cure. 7. **Trial and Error with Unknown Substances**: Desperation could lead to the use of various unknown or untested substances in an attempt to provoke a bowel movement. This approach could be dangerous if the substance was toxic. Medicine in ancient times was not as effective as it is today, and people often lived with chronic conditions that could not be treated successfully. Additionally, the overall approach to health and illness was deeply intertwined with cultural and religious beliefs, which further influenced the methods and treatments used. It's important to note that the success and safety of ancient treatments were variable, and outcomes were not guaranteed. Treatments that were ineffective or harmful would not meet modern healthcare standards and are not recommended for use today. If someone experiences constipation or any other health issue nowadays, it's essential to seek advice from qualified healthcare professionals who have access to the wealth of safe and effective modern medical knowledge and treatments."},{"instruction":"Write a list of various 2010s animated movie characters, and for each character, a hypothetical description of what their Final Smash might be like if they were added to a Super Smash Bros. game as a playable character, with each Final Smash having an explanation on what it is a reference to","output":"1. **Elsa (Frozen) - Winter's Fury** Final Smash: Elsa's powers surge, and she casts a massive blizzard across the battlefield, freezing opposing players in blocks of ice.

Designed during the Second Constitutional Convention and amended over the course of the People's Awakening, the Union System goes as follows: A state's unions come together and convene in a month-long session every three years to elect through popular, anonymous vote the representatives who will represent their state and series of unions in the House of People's Representatives. Unions such as the AFL, FAAW and FATD will appoint delegates to stand in said sessions through consensus voting. Dubbed \\"Wheels\\", several states are grouped by geographic or administrative type so as to create regional cohesion with legal or economic projects. There are 854 delegates to the Wheel Section of the House of People's Representatives. WHAT THE WHEEL SECTION CAN DO 1. Propose legislative pertaining to: 1a. Worker's rights and responsibilites 1b. Economic policies and plans 1c. Foreign affairs 1d. Taxes and unions 2. Approve Cabinet and Agency appointments WHAT THE WHEEL SECTION CAN'T DO 1. Impeach or convict the President on criminal charges 2. Propose legislative pertaining to: 1a. Religious policy 1b. Social policy 1c. Treaty ratification\\" What is the closest real-life equivalent to the Wheels if any exists? For context, this is from an alternate history scenario in which the United States underwent a communist revolution in the 1920s. Despite adopting communism, the United States merged some of its traditions with communism to create a unique system.","output":"The \\"Wheel System\\" described here is a fictional, alternative political framework that does not have a direct real-life equivalent. It appears to blend elements of various political systems, including workers' councils, syndicalism, and federalism. Here are a few real-life concepts and systems that share some similarities with the Wheel System, although none of them match it precisely: 1. **Soviet System** - In the historical context of the Soviet Union, the term \\"soviet\\" referred to workers' councils that were intended to directly represent the interests of the working classes. Although the soviets were initially designed as grassroots democratic institutions, over time the Soviet Union evolved into a more top-down, autocratic system. 2. **Syndicalism** - Syndicalism is a movement advocating for the transfer of power from capitalists to workers' syndicates (unions) that would own and manage industries. The election of representatives by workers' unions in the Wheel System has parallels with syndicalist ideas, but the Wheel System incorporates these ideas within a larger legislative framework. 3. **Federalist Systems** - The grouping of several states into \\"Wheels\\" for regional cohesion mirrors some aspects of federalist systems, where individual states or regions retain certain powers while contributing to a larger national governance structure. 4. **Proportional Representation** - Though not specified in the provided text, the system of electing representatives through popular vote within the unions could imply a form of proportional representation, where political representation in the legislature is closely matched to the proportions of votes received by each union, as opposed to a winner-takes-all system. 5. **Consensus Voting** - The AFL, FAAW, and FATD using consensus voting to appoint delegates suggests a more cooperative and less adversarial form of decision-making that is typically associated with more collaborative political cultures or smaller-scale direct democratic systems. It's important to note that while these real-life concepts share certain features with the Wheel System, the structure described in the passage is a unique creation of an alternate history scenario and does not correspond to any one existing or historical system in its entirety. The merging of American political traditions with aspects of socialist and communist governance creates a theoretical hybrid that has not been seen in the real world."},{"instruction":"Write a list of 10 Zootopia characters, and for each character, write a dialog line for that character where they describe who they are in 2 sentences","output":"1. **Judy Hopps** - \\"Hi, I'm Judy Hopps, the first rabbit officer of the Zootopia Police Department.

Incorporate neon signs, cables, and a dark, neon-lit cityscape. 10. **Mexican Folk Art Prompt Generator** - Design a street shirt that honors Mexican hip hop culture with elements of traditional Mexican folk art. The \\"FRANKO 3XL\\" text should be adorned in folk-style decorations with vibrant colors and patterns, contrasting a central white circular tower icon that bridges the ancient with the modern hip hop scene."},{"instruction":"Я случайно упал в скользкий лед и у меня почему то остановилась дыхание","output":"То, что вы пережили перестановку дыхания после падения на льду, может быть связано с рядом причин. Падение может вызвать рефлекторную реакцию, например, васповодило, из-за чего на короткое время задержалось дыхание, это может быть результатом мгновенного стресса или шока. Если ваше дыхание восстановилось и вы не чувствуете других серьезных симптомов (например, сильной боли, головокружения, потери сознания), скорее всего, это был временный инцидент, и особой опасности уже нет.

Вот некоторые сценарии, когда падение может привести к временной или постоянной остановке дыхания: 1. Травма шейного отдела позвоночника: Если при падении произошла травма позвоночника, особенно в шейном отделе, это может привести к повреждению нервов, которые контролируют дыхательные мышцы. 2. Травматическая гипоксия мозга: Травма головы может привести к потере сознания, в результате чего дыхательный центр мозга временно не будет контролировать дыхание должным образом. 3. Рефлекторная апноэ: Сильный шок или болевая реакция могут привести к кратковременной остановке дыхания из-за рефлекторного ответа организма. 4. Заблокирование дыхательных путей: Падение может нарушить проходимость дыхательных путей, например, если человек потеряет сознание и его язык загруднет гортань или если произойдет рвота и аспирация. 5. Травма грудной клетки: Сильный удар по груди в результате падения может привести к реберным переломам, которые могут повредить легкие и другие структуры в грудной полости, вызывая трудности с дыханием или его остановку. В любом из этих случаев необходима немедленная медицинская помощь. Если вы или кто-то поблизости столкнулись с ситуацией, когда после падения остановилось дыхание, важно как можно скорее вызвать скорую помощь.

Negativity bias: Human brains tend to pay more attention to negative experiences due to evolutionary reasons. It was more crucial for survival to remember and avoid negative outcomes (like threats) than to focus on positive ones. This bias can cause bad memories to be more easily recalled and dwelled upon than good ones. 2. Emotional intensity: Negative events often elicit stronger emotions. Memories associated with strong emotions, particularly unpleasant ones like fear or sadness, are more likely to be vividly remembered. This can make it seem like bad memories are more prevalent. 3. Rumination: Some individuals have a tendency to ruminate or consistently think about the same negative thoughts or memories. This can be a symptom of underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety, where one might be more likely to dwell on negative experiences. 4. Past traumas: Traumatic experiences can have a lasting impact and can cause intrusive memories or flashbacks that are hard to shake. This is characteristic of conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 5. Lack of positive experiences: If you're going through a particularly difficult time, it might seem like there are fewer positive memories to recall, making the negative ones stand out more. 6. Cognitive habits: Sometimes, the habit of thinking negatively can be reinforced over time, creating a pattern where the mind automatically goes to bad memories. 7. Confirmation bias: If you believe that only bad things happen to you, you might be more likely to remember the events that confirm this belief and forget those that don't. It's important to note that if you're struggling with negative thoughts and memories to a point where it's affecting your day-to-day life, it could be beneficial to seek the support of a mental health professional. They can help provide strategies to cope with these memories, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can challenge and change unhelpful cognitive distortions and behaviors, improve emotional regulation, and develop personal coping strategies."},{"instruction":"Write a detailed description of Nick Wilde from Zootopia, written how Nick Wilde from Zootopia would explain himself","output":"Ah, Nick Wilde here. You're curious about yours truly? I'm flattered, really. Well, I suppose I can spare a minute or two to paint you a picture of who I am – through my own eyes, of course. First off, let me ease into it by saying I'm a fox. A red fox, to be precise, with fur as russet as the last rays of sunshine on a warm summer evening. And if you're thinking \\"sly as a fox,\\" you're not entirely wrong. I've got this disarmingly charming smile and a pair of emerald eyes that seem to twinkle with a mischievous light. Don't blame me; I was just born this way. I'm quite the snappy dresser too, you know. I've got style – it's not everybody who can pull off a green Hawaiian shirt and still look this good. Topped off with a tie because, let's be honest, a touch of professionalism never hurt anyone. It's sort of my trademark look, along with that debonair cream-colored fedora that sits just right on my head. Personality-wise, I'm what you would call street-smart. Growing up on the not-so-nice side of town can do that to a young fox. I had to learn the hard way that if you're not fast, you're last. And so, I honed the art of the hustle. I became a con artist, a smooth talker, the guy with a scheme for everything. My motto? \\"Never let them see that they get to you.\\" Life's a stage, and I'm one heck of an actor. But beneath this crafty exterior? Well, let's just say there's more to me than meets the eye. I've done my fair share of hustles, sure, but I'm no heartless rogue. I've got my vulnerabilities, thanks to a childhood dream that went south because of, well, you know, those pesky stereotypes about us foxes. Turns out, society's biases can throw a wrench in the works of even the best-laid plans. Sure, I got a chip on my shoulder – who wouldn't? But my encounter with a certain bunny cop started chipping away at old Nick. She saw right through the façade, could you believe it? And before I knew it, I was helping her solve a case that went way deeper than any hustle I'd ever pulled. Who would have thought, right? I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm a bit of a paradox. On the one hand, a cynical, wise-cracking fox with a penchant for mischief. On the other, someone who really does care, deep down, about making things right. Because in the end, being a good guy – maybe even a hero – it's not such a bad gig. Not that I'd ever admit it out loud. Got to maintain that rogueish image, you know? So there you have it, the Nick Wilde story. Or at least, the version I'm willing to share. Let's just keep this between us, okay? Keep that street cred intact.

Nick is a con artist and street-savvy hustler who knows how to manipulate the system to his advantage but, throughout the course of the movie, undergoes significant personal growth. # Appearance: Nick Wilde has a slender, anthropomorphic build akin to other characters in Zootopia. In terms of anthropomorphic size, he stands just over 4 feet tall. His fur is primarily reddish-orange, complemented by a white muzzle, face, and underbelly. This color scheme is typical of a red fox. He has emerald green eyes that pair with his mischievous smirk to give him a roguish charm. His ears are pointed, consistent with vulpine features, and he has a bushy, white-tipped tail. Nick typically sports a green Hawaiian shirt with a subtle leaf pattern, a pair of beige trousers, and a thin indigo necktie loosely knotted. He completes his ensemble with a pair of dark brown lace-up shoes. This casual yet slightly disheveled attire reflects his laid-back attitude and streetwise nature. # Personality: At the beginning of \\"Zootopia,\\" Nick Wilde is presented as a cynical and somewhat jaded character. His experiences as a fox, a species burdened by stereotypes and prejudice, have shaped him into the savvy and somewhat untrustworthy fox we see. He prides himself on his ability to outsmart others and his deep-seated independence. Nick's willingness to bend rules comes from his belief that life isn't fair, a lesson he learned at an early age when his dreams were crushed by preconceived biases against foxes. Despite his slick exterior, Nick possesses a sharp intellect and a remarkable level of cunning. He is good-humored, often engaging in playful banter and employing sarcasm. His charisma allows him to navigate various social interactions with ease, making him adept at pulling off scams. # Development and Transformation: Nick's character experiences a significant transformation during \\"Zootopia.\\" His perspective begins to shift when he becomes involved with Officer Judy Hopps, an optimistic and determined rabbit who refuses to subscribe to the same cynical worldview. Throughout their adventures together, Nick confronts his own biases and starts to see the benefits of teamwork and trust. He gradually reveals a more vulnerable side, giving viewers insight into the pain and disappointment he endured in his youth. His defensive and sarcastic behavior is shown to be a facade to protect himself from further hurt. As Judy treats him with respect and genuinely relies on his skills, Nick begins to reassess his life choices and slowly evolves from a self-serving con artist into a true friend and, ultimately, a hero. # Relationships: Nick's most significant relationship is with Judy Hopps. Though their partnership starts out rocky, they develop a strong bond built on mutual respect and understanding. Their dynamic is a key element of the movie, illustrating themes of tolerance, redemption, and the power of friendship to overcome societal barriers. # Conclusion: Nick Wilde's charm, intelligence, and depth make him a standout character in \\"Zootopia.\\" His journey from a cynical outsider to a noble member of the Zootopia Police Department is a testament to his complexity as a character, and underlines the importance of empathy and personal growth. Nick's transformation reflects the overarching message of the film, which celebrates diversity and encourages viewers to look beyond stereotypes and prejudices."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1988 And Their Meaning?","output":"Sure, satirical slogans are meant to humorously critique or mock a subject. In 1988, General Motors (GM) divisions had distinctive design features and reputations that lend themselves to satirical slogan creation. Let's imagine a few potential slogans for various GM divisions from that era, along with their satirical meanings: 1. Chevrolet - \\"Like a Rock. A Really Boxy, Square Rock.\\" Satirical meaning: This slogan pokes fun at the boxy design language that was common in Chevrolet models of the 1980s, which some might have considered unappealingly plain and brick-like. 2. Pontiac - \\"We Build Excitement, One Plastic Cladding at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: Pontiac was known for its liberal use of plastic body cladding on cars like the Pontiac Grand Am, which was either loved for its sporty look or derided for seeming cheap and excessive. 3. Oldsmobile - \\"Not Your Father's Oldsmobile... Because Even He Didn't Want It.\\" Satirical meaning: Playing on Oldsmobile's actual slogan from the era, this version insinuates that the brand's attempt to appeal to a younger market might not have been very successful, even failing to retain the older demographic. 4. Buick - \\"When You're Too Young for Cadillac but Too Old for Style.\\" Satirical meaning: This slogan teases Buick's traditional image as a car brand for those who wanted luxury without the sportiness or the cachet of Cadillac, which might be seen as falling into a no-man's land of style. 5. Cadillac - \\"The Cimarron: Because What Says Luxury Like a Rebadged Chevy Cavalier?\\" Satirical meaning: GM faced criticism for badge engineering during this era, and this slogan critiques the Cadillac Cimarron, which was infamously based on the more economy-focused Chevy Cavalier, diluting Cadillac's luxury image. 6. GMC - \\"We're Just Like Chevrolet Trucks, But for Some Reason, More Expensive.\\" Satirical meaning: GMC and Chevrolet have historically offered very similar product lineups with subtle differences, and this slogan humorously questions why consumers would pay more for largely identical vehicles, except for branding. Remember, the point of satire is to offer critique or commentary through humor, and these slogans are not actual GM slogans but rather imaginative takes on GM's 1980s vehicle designs and marketing strategies."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1974 And Their Meaning?","output":"Absolutely, creating satirical slogans based on a specific year like 1974, which was in the midst of the American automotive industry's struggle with new emissions regulations, the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, and the general move towards downsizing, can be quite amusing. Let's take a look at what these might be for GM divisions: 1. Chevrolet - \\"Building a Better Tomorrow, One Vega at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: The Chevrolet Vega was an attempt by GM to enter the compact car market but was plagued by reliability issues and poor build quality. The slogan pokes fun at Chevrolet's optimistic vision for the future, contrasted with the subpar reality of the Vega. 2. Pontiac - \\"Pontiac: Because Who Needs Horsepower When You've Got Style?\\" Satirical meaning: In response to emissions regulations, engines were being detuned, resulting in reduced horsepower. Pontiac, known for muscle cars, had to shift focus towards styling over performance. 3. Oldsmobile - \\"Oldsmobile: Starting Your Mid-Life Crisis With Emission-Controlled Splendor.\\" Satirical meaning: As Oldsmobiles were seen as cars for older, more established customers, this slogan humorously suggests that their cars were both the catalyst for a mid-life crisis and emblematic of the era's lackluster performance due to emissions controls. 4. Buick - \\"Buick: Because Luxury Is Only Skin Deep.\\" Satirical meaning: This slogan cheekily insinuates that while Buick may have maintained a luxurious facade, the under-the-hood changes to cope with emissions regulations left something to be desired in terms of performance. 5. Cadillac - \\"Cadillac: It's Not the Size That Counts, It's the Badge.\\" Satirical meaning: During a time when downsizing was becoming more common due to the oil crisis, this slogan suggests Cadillac's continued emphasis on large, prestigious vehicles was out of touch with the era's trends, asserting that the brand's prestige was more important than practicality. 6. GMC - \\"GMC: Because Nothing Says 'Heavy Duty' Like a 1974 Fuel Crisis.\\" Satirical meaning: GMC's focus on trucks and utility vehicles is humorously contrasted with the 1974 fuel crisis, highlighting the impracticality of gas-guzzling vehicles during times of fuel shortages. Remember, these are purely satirical and meant to highlight some of the challenges and perceptions of the automotive industry in 1974 through a humorous lens. They are not meant to disparage the brands or their efforts to adapt during a challenging period for the auto industry."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Volkswagen Group Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2015 And Their Meaning?","output":"Certainly! Let's create some satirical slogans for various Volkswagen Group divisions, reflecting on the design and events around 2015, particularly the Dieselgate emissions scandal: 1. Volkswagen - \\"Das Auto. Das Problem.\\" Satirical meaning: Playing on VW's slogan \\"Das Auto\\" (The Car), this mocks VW for the Dieselgate scandal, where they admitted to cheating on emissions tests. 2. Audi - \\"Vorsprung durch Technik* (*Software nicht inbegriffen)\\" Satirical meaning: Audi's slogan means \\"Advancement through Technology.\\" The satire here suggests their technology sadly didn't include honest software, referencing that some Audi diesel models were also implicated in the Dieselgate emissions cheating. 3. SEAT - \\"Haciendo Diesel Inaudible Desde 2015.\\" Satirical meaning: SEAT, a Volkswagen Group brand with a Spanish flavor, this slogan playfully suggests they've been making diesel engines \\"inaudible\\" or undetectable in terms of emissions since 2015, referencing the emissions scandal. 4. Škoda - \\"Simply Clever, Simply Not Detected.\\" Satirical meaning: Škoda’s slogan, “Simply Clever,” is humorously twisted to imply their cleverness extended to evading emissions detection, again, poking fun at the Dieselgate scandal. 5. Porsche - \\"There Is No Substitute for Compliance... Except When There Is.\\" Satirical meaning: Porsche's slogan has often been \\"There is no substitute,\\" referring to their high performance. The satirical twist implies that they also believed there was no substitute for regulatory compliance unless they chose to evade it. 6. Bentley - \\"Luxury Redefined, Emissions Redesigned.\\" Satirical meaning: Known for opulent luxury vehicles, this slogan winks at how even their emissions figures were given a \\"luxurious\\" makeover — artificially improved through deceptive software. 7. Lamborghini - \\"We Don't Always Cheat on Emissions, But When We Do, We Do It Stylishly.\\" Satirical meaning: Lamborghini is synonymous with extravagant style. The slogan humorously suggests that any dalliance they had with emissions cheating was done with as much flair as their car designs. 8. Bugatti - \\"Exceeding Expectations, Sidestepping Emissions.\\" Satirical meaning: Bugatti cars aim to surpass what's possible in terms of performance, and the satirical slogan implies they perhaps tried to do the same with emissions regulations. It’s important to note that these satirical remarks are for entertainment and reflect the controversies surrounding the Volkswagen Group during the 2015 Dieselgate scandal. They serve to humorously critique the brand images in light of significant corporate challenges."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Volkswagen Group Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2009 And Their Meaning?","output":"Creating satirical slogans for Volkswagen Group divisions with a 2009 design context invites humor surrounding the styling trends and industry happenings of that time, without the shadow of the Dieselgate scandal, which emerged later. Here are some imagined slogans: 1. Volkswagen - \\"Because You Thought 'Circle' Was Just a Shape, Not a Car Design Philosophy.\\" Satirical meaning: This mocks Volkswagen's design language at the time, which many felt was overly reliant on conservative, rounded shapes, leading to a family resemblance across the range that some found dull. 2. Audi - \\"Audi: Where LEDs Light The Way... To More LEDs.\\" Satirical meaning: Audi was one of the pioneers in using LED daytime running lights, and by 2009 they had become a signature feature. This slogan pokes fun at what might seem like an obsession with this design element. 3. SEAT - \\"Emoción or Repetition? With SEAT, It's Hard to Tell.\\" Satirical meaning: SEAT aimed to bring a sense of Spanish 'emoción' (emotion/passion) to their cars. This slogan humorously suggests that SEAT's models were perhaps less distinguishable from each other, despite this passionate branding. 4. Škoda - \\"Simply Clever... at Being Volkswagen's Look-Alike.\\" Satirical meaning: Škoda’s \\"Simply Clever\\" motto is twisted here to insinuate that their products were clever mainly in resembling their parent company Volkswagen's designs, albeit typically at a more affordable price point. 5. Porsche - \\"Because 'Rear-Engine' Is Not Just a Design. It's an Adventure.\\" Satirical meaning: Porsche, particularly known for the 911 with its rear-engine layout, is humorously depicted as sticking with a unique (and sometimes challenging) design feature that other manufacturers had long abandoned for mainstream models. 6. Bentley - \\"Bentley: For When Your Mansion Needs a Twin.\\" Satirical meaning: Bentley vehicles are known for their luxurious and stately presence. This slogan jokes that a Bentley car is like a second mansion, indicating excess and grandeur on wheels. 7. Lamborghini - \\"Lamborghini: Because Subtlety Is Overrated.\\" Satirical meaning: Lamborghini is renowned for creating outlandish supercars. The slogan satirizes their flamboyant design ethos, which is anything but subtle. 8. Bugatti - \\"Bugatti: Reinventing Speed Bumps as Performance Tests.\\" Satirical meaning: As Bugatti vehicles, like the Veyron, are known for their extreme speed, this slogan humorously hints that speed bumps are not obstacles but just another way to test the car's performance capabilities. These imagined slogans are intended to be playful jabs at the design philosophies and branding of Volkswagen Group's divisions in 2009. They highlight the quirks and distinct characteristics that automotive enthusiasts and the public might associate with each brand."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical DaimlerChrysler Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1999 And Their Meaning?","output":"Creating satirical slogans for DaimlerChrysler (which merged in 1998) referencing their designs and the corporate culture in 1999 presents an opportunity for humor rooted in the unique dynamics of the short-lived union between the American and German automotive giants. 1. Chrysler - \\"Engineered Like No Other Car in America... Because It's Really German.\\" Satirical meaning: As the merger brought a blend of German engineering to the American Chrysler lineup, this slogan pokes fun at the perceived elevation of quality due to German influence, whether it was true in practice or not. 2. Dodge - \\"Dodge: Grab Life by the Horns, and Hope They're Attached to a German Engine.\\" Satirical meaning: Dodge's bold, aggressive American image is humorously juxtaposed with a hope that German engineering might boost reliability and performance. 3. Jeep - \\"Jeep: Go Anywhere, Engineered Everywhere.\\" Satirical meaning: This satirical take suggests that Jeep's iconic all-terrain capability was now combined with a mix of American and German engineering practices, for better or worse. 4. Mercedes-Benz - \\"Mercedes-Benz: Because Luxury Can Tolerate a Little Company.\\" Satirical meaning: Mercedes-Benz, known for luxury and precision, is humorously depicted as stoically enduring the merger with the mass-market Chrysler Corporation. 5. Plymouth - \\"Plymouth: Fusing American Ingenuity with German... Wait, Nevermind.\\" Satirical meaning: By 2001, Plymouth was discontinued, and the slogan wryly acknowledges the German-American merger's effect (or lack thereof) on the Plymouth brand. 6. Smart - \\"Smart: Redefining Compact, One Merger at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: This slogan teases Smart's tiny car design by suggesting that, like everything else in the DaimlerChrysler era, even the concept of 'compact' was being merged and redefined. Remember, these imagined slogans playfully exaggerate the sentiments and perspectives held by some industry observers and consumers during the era when two very different corporate cultures were trying to operate as one. The period was notable for a range of product and strategic missteps, as well as cultural clashes that ultimately led to the unwinding of the merger."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2013 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 2013, American car companies were still navigating the post-recession market, focusing on modernizing their lineups with new design languages and technologies, while also dealing with stereotypes of the past. Here are some playful, satirical takes on slogans for a few major American car companies from that period: 1. Ford - \\"Go Further, Because You'll Want to Keep Driving Past the Repair Shop.\\" Satirical meaning: This riff on Ford's actual slogan \\"Go Further\\" jokingly suggests that Ford vehicles, traditionally criticized for their reliability, would want to avoid the repair shop thanks to improvements, or perhaps in denial of persistent reliability issues. 2. Chevrolet - \\"Find New Roads, Because the Old Ones Have Our Recalled Cars On Them.\\" Satirical meaning: This slogan pokes fun at Chevrolet's \\"Find New Roads\\" by referring to the numerous recalls that automotive companies often face. It humorously suggests seeking new paths to escape from the stigma attached to those recalls. 3. Chrysler - \\"Imported from Detroit, Along With Some European Flair (and Owners).\\" Satirical meaning: Playing off Chrysler's \\"Imported from Detroit\\" campaign, this slogan teases Chrysler's multiple European ownerships and partnerships over the years, including its association with Fiat at the time, humorously blending its identity with international influences. 4. Dodge - \\"Dodge the Ordinary. Hit the Service Center.\\" Satirical meaning: A playful twist on Dodge's performance image, this slogan satirizes the stereotype that American performance cars spend more time in maintenance than on the road, despite Dodge's strides in improving quality. 5. Cadillac - \\"The New Standard of the World, Because the Old Standard Was Getting a Bit Rusty.\\" Satirical meaning: Cadillac historically positioned itself as the \\"Standard of the World,\\" but this slogan jests that the brand's previous reputation had shown its age before recent revitalization efforts. 6. Jeep - \\"There's Only One Jeep, and It's in the Shop Again.\\" Satirical meaning: Jeep is known for its ruggedness and off-road prowess. This slogan humorously alludes to the notion that such tough vehicles inevitably need a fair bit of maintenance, playing on the old adage of their reliability. 7. Tesla (granted not as \\"traditional\\" as the others) - \\"Tesla: Electrify the Future, One Software Update at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: As a nod to Tesla's tech-focused approach and regular over-the-air software updates, this slogan hints at the company's continual refinement and sometimes beta-like approach to car features. These fictional slogans are intended for satirical purposes, to gently poke fun at the reputations and idiosyncrasies of American car companies as perceived by some consumers and commentators in 2013. They playfully critique the evolution of these brands and their efforts to redefine themselves in a competitive global market."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1998 And Their Meaning?","output":"In 1998, American car companies were known for their distinctive design choices, often harkening back to older, more traditional automotive styles, or venturing into new territories of design with varying levels of success. Let's look at some satirical slogans based on that year: 1. Ford - \\"Built Ford Tough... To Start on the Third Try.\\" Satirical meaning: While Ford's trucks boasted durability, this slogan teases the stereotype of reliability issues with American cars at the time, suggesting even their toughest vehicles needed a bit of coaxing to get going. 2. Chevrolet - \\"Like a Rock. You Know, One That Doesn’t Move Without a Jump Start.\\" Satirical meaning: Playing on Chevy's classic \\"Like a Rock\\" slogan for their trucks, implying robustness, this satirical version pokes fun at the reliability and sometimes sluggish performance of American vehicles from the era. 3. Chrysler - \\"Inspiration Comes Standard. Everything Else Is Optional.\\" Satirical meaning: Chrysler aimed for an image of innovation and upscale design in the late '90s, and this slogan humorously suggests that while they focused on conceptual brilliance, practical features might require an upgrade. 4. Dodge - \\"Grab Life by the Horns — If the Transmission Holds Up.\\" Satirical meaning: Dodge vehicles were marketed with a sense of boldness, yet the brand, like many American carmakers at the time, faced criticism for transmission reliability, hence the playful jab. 5. Cadillac - \\"Creating a Higher Standard. Because Ground Clearance Is for Peasants.\\" Satirical meaning: Cadillac was known for its luxury sedans with a low ride, which is humorously touted here as a feature that distinguishes it from more proletarian high-clearance vehicles. 6. Pontiac - \\"Driving Excitement. Or at Least, That's What the Body Cladding Is Supposed to Convince You Of.\\" Satirical meaning: In the '90s, Pontiac often used generous amounts of plastic body cladding to convey sportiness, which became a styling critique point. This slogan pokes fun at the supposed correlation between lots of cladding and driving exhilaration. 7. Lincoln - \\"What a Luxury Car Should Be — And What Our Designers Think That Is, Circa 1978.\\" Satirical meaning: Lincoln cars, with their stately and often retro design language, seemed stuck in the past to some. This slogan lampoons the perceived datedness of their 1998 designs. These satirical slogans play off of historical perceptions and are meant for humor. They lend a light-hearted critique of American car design strategies and brand perceptions that existed in 1998."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Car Company Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1911 and Their Meaning?","output":"Imagining satirical slogans for American car companies in 1911 presents a playful challenge since it was the dawn of the automotive era, and branding as we know it was quite different. Yet, let's take a whimsical approach to what these slogans could have been, reflecting the times: 1. Ford - \\"Ford: Putting the Horse Out to Pasture, One Model T at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T, which would go on to revolutionize personal transportation. The slogan teases the idea that cars were making horses obsolete, a common sentiment as automobiles became more prevalent. 2. Oldsmobile - \\"Oldsmobile: Because Who Needs Horses When You Have a Curved Dash?\\" Satirical meaning: Oldsmobile's Curved Dash was one of the first mass-produced automobiles. The slogan pokes fun at the fact that, despite its novel engineering, to some, it still paled in comparison to the majesty of a horse. 3. Buick - \\"Buick: Proof That a Car Can Look Just as Stiff as a Top Hat.\\" Satirical meaning: Early Buick models often had a very formal, upright appearance, so this slogan humorously compares the car’s styling to the formal headwear of the era. 4. Cadillac - \\"Cadillac: The Car You Can Trust, If It Actually Starts.\\" Satirical meaning: Cadillac was an early adopter of electric self-starters (introduced in 1912), but before that, starting a car was a laborious and sometimes unreliable process. This slogan plays on the contrast between luxury branding and early automotive reliability. 5. Chevrolet - \\"Chevrolet: Because Who Doesn't Want Their Car to be a Fixer-Upper?\\" Satirical meaning: Embracing the \\"do-it-yourself\\" attitude that early car owners often had to have, this slogan ironically suggests that owning a vehicle was as much a hobby in mechanical problem-solving as it was a means of transportation. 6. Studebaker - \\"Studebaker: Making Buggies Obsolete, One Noisy Ride at a Time.\\" Satirical meaning: Studebaker was transitioning from horse-drawn vehicles to automobiles, and this slogan highlights the noisier, rattling experience of early cars compared to the quieter (if slower) buggies. Remember, these imagined slogans are retrospective creations meant to humorously highlight the quirks and growing pains of the early automobile industry, drawing on the charm and simplicity of 1911 automotive technology and culture."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Sarcastic American TV Network Slogans That Are Based On Their Ratings During 1996 and Their Meaning?","output":"In 1996, television networks were competing fiercely for viewers, and the emergence of cable TV brought even more players to the field. Imagining sarcastic slogans for the American TV networks based on their ratings during that period could provide some humoristically pointed commentary on their standings and programming choices. Here are a few: 1. NBC - \\"NBC: Must See TV, because what else are you going to do with rabbit ears?\\" Sarcastic meaning: At the time, NBC had several popular shows and boasted the tagline \\"Must See TV.\\" This sarcastic take suggests that NBC's success may have been due in part to viewers with limited access to cable or satellite options rather than overwhelming content appeal. 2. CBS - \\"CBS: Welcome to America's Most Watched Network... by Your Grandparents.\\" Sarcastic meaning: CBS has often catered to an older demographic compared to its competitors. The slogan teases the idea that their top ratings might stem from an audience demographic resistant to changing viewing habits or technologies. 3. ABC - \\"ABC: Always Broadcasting... Commercials.\\" Sarcastic meaning: This riff suggests that ABC, though featuring programs that pulled viewers, might also have been remembered for an abundance of ad breaks that could be frustrating for those trying to enjoy their favorite shows. 4. FOX - \\"FOX: Because edgy teen sitcoms and sci-fi are what the people want.\\" Sarcastic meaning: Fox was known for targeting younger demographics with shows like \\"Beverly Hills, 90210\\" and \\"The X-Files.\\" The slogan humorously acknowledges the network's success in capturing the interests of a specific niche market. 5. The WB (Warner Bros. Television) - \\"The WB: Catering to teen angst since 1995.\\" Sarcastic meaning: The WB, launched in 1995, quickly became associated with shows like \\"Dawson's Creek\\" that were aimed at teens. The slogan wittily hints at the network's strategy of appealing to younger viewers through melodramatic high school dramas. 6. UPN (United Paramount Network) - \\"UPN: Underwhelming Programming Nationwide.\\" Sarcastic meaning: UPN struggled with ratings and faced criticism for its programming quality. The slogan sarcastically repurposes the network's acronym to highlight these challenges. 7. CNN - \\"CNN: We're news people trust, after they've checked all their other sources.\\" Sarcastic meaning: CNN was a leader in 24-hour news, but with the proliferation of news outlets, this slogan suggests viewers would turn to CNN only after surveying other sources, despite its efforts to be a primary news authority. These sarcastic slogans take a light-hearted jab at the television networks' reputations and programming strategies. They reflect the competitive environment and viewers' perceptions during the mid-90s era of TV."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Sarcastic American Mobile Telecommunications Slogans During 2004?","output":"Sure, I can imagine some playful and sarcastic takes on mobile telecommunications slogans from 2004, when the industry was quite competitive, and companies were vying for the attention of consumers with expanding services like 3G internet and new mobile devices. Keep in mind that sarcasm is often used to humorously convey the opposite of the literal meaning, often as a form of witty criticism or to poke fun at industry quirks. Here are a few fictional examples with a lighthearted, sarcastic spin: 1. \\"Because who needs reliable service when you can have a shiny new flip phone every month?\\" 2. \\"Drop calls, not just names. Because exclusivity includes our network's selective connectivity.\\" 3. \\"Unlimited data plans - so you can keep browsing... even when you're stuck on 'Loading...' forever.\\" 4. \\"Roaming fees: because your vacation needed a little more adventure. And your wallet needed a diet.\\" 5. \\"Always connected (to your charger), because battery life is overrated.\\" 6. \\"Experience our nationwide coverage—you'll find our gaps almost as thrilling as our service!\\" 7. \\"Sure, we have 3G. It stands for 'Good luck, Get patient, and Guess what your bill will be!'\\" 8. \\"Customer service that's out of this world—literally. Because it feels like our call center is on Mars.\\" 9. \\"Our family plan: because nothing brings the family closer than arguing over data usage.\\" 10. \\"Join our network and enjoy the 'Exclusive' feeling of searching for signal bars.\\" These playful examples embody the spirit of sarcasm you'd likely have encountered during that period while also reflecting some of the common public sentiments about mobile telecommunications services at the time."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Sarcastic American Mobile Telecommunications Company Slogans During 2004?","output":"Absolutely! In 2004, mobile telecommunication companies were quite cheeky with their marketing, often throwing subtle jabs at each other. Here are some humorous and sarcastic takes on what those slogans could have been: 1. “Our 'nationwide' coverage: Because you always wanted to explore those dead zones.” 2. “Feel free to roam. Your signal certainly does!” 3. “Adding more dropped calls to your life—because who needs complete conversations, anyway?” 4. “Unlimited data plans, asterisk included.” 5. “Experience the thrill of the hunt—network signal edition.” 6. “More bars in more places—except where you live, work, or travel.” 7. “Our customer service line: your chance to practice patience and deep breathing.” 8. “Like a good neighbor, our signal stays over there.” 9. “Now offering picture messaging: Pixelation has never looked so... abstract.” 10. “Join our family plan: The perfect test for your relationships!” It's important to note that these are entirely fictional and meant for humorous purposes, as actual marketing campaigns, even sarcastic ones, still aim to position the company in a positive light to attract and retain customers."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Sarcastic American Mobile Telecommunications Slogans That Are Based On Their Contract Prices During 2004?","output":"As an AI, I can imagine a variety of slogans following the sarcastic theme you requested, based on the general sentiment consumers might have had towards mobile telecommunications pricing and contract terms in 2004. Remember, these would not be real slogans used by the companies, but rather parodies that play on common frustrations of the time. 1. AT&T: \\"Because Who Doesn't Love a Two-Year Commitment? Welcome to 'I Do' With AT&T!\\" 2. Verizon Wireless: \\"Got Signal? Hope So, Because You're With Us for a Good Long While!\\" 3. Sprint PCS: \\"Sprint into Savings! ...And Then Slowly Jog Through Two Years of Payments.\\" 4. T-Mobile: \\"Stick With Us Long Enough, and You Might Just Forget There Are Other Carriers Out There!\\" 5. Cingular Wireless (which merged with AT&T in 2004): \\"Raising the 'Bars' on Long-Term Relationships Since 2004!\\" 6. Nextel: \\"Join the Network Where 'More Bars in More Places' Means More Dollars From Your Wallet!\\" Of course, these slogans are meant to be humorous and should be taken lightly. Real branding efforts by companies usually try to convey the positive aspects of their services, even if consumers may have had mixed feelings about contractual obligations and pricing structures."},{"instruction":"is breakwater constructed in sections or is the whole length constructed at once","output":"Breakwaters, which are structures constructed along coastlines to protect shores from the force of waves, can be constructed in different ways. The choice of construction method typically depends on several factors including the type of breakwater, materials used, site conditions, the length of the structure, environmental considerations, and the project's budget and timeline. Generally, breakwaters can be constructed using one of the following methods: 1. In Sections: Breakwaters are often built in sections or stages. This allows for a phased construction approach where part of the structure is completed and functional before the entire length is finished. This method may also be used in adverse weather regions where construction windows are limited or to allow for adjustments to be made during construction as conditions or requirements change. 2. Modular Units: Some breakwaters are made of pre-cast or pre-assembled modular units that are put in place sequentially. These units, which could be concrete caissons, blocks, or tetrapods, are transported to the site and sunk into position. 3. End-On Construction: This is a continuous process where materials (like rock or concrete) are added continuously to extend the breakwater from one end. The construction progresses incrementally along the projected path of the breakwater until the full length is achieved. 4. Floating and Sinking: Large floating caissons made of concrete or other materials are floated to the correct location and then sunk into place to form part of the breakwater structure. The construction method also depends on the type of breakwater, such as rubble mound, vertical wall, or floating breakwaters. With rubble mound breakwaters, for example, the components such as rock, concrete blocks, or other armoring units can be placed gradually, building up the structure section by section. In sum, breakwaters can be constructed in sections, allowing for more flexibility during the building process, or they may be created in one continuous process, depending on the construction method chosen for the specific needs of the project."},{"instruction":"100 suspensful dark anime no fan service","output":"Finding anime series that are both suspenseful and dark, without including fan service, can be a challenge, but there is still a good selection of titles that fit this description.

Remember to take these with a grain of humor, as they are fictitious and intended for entertainment purposes: 1. Ford: \\"Ford: Because Round Is How We Roll\\" - Playing on Ford's design trend in the 90s with vehicles like the Taurus and the Contour, which featured very oval and rounded styling cues. 2. Chevrolet: \\"Chevrolet: We're Not Old, We're Classic\\" - A nod to how some of Chevy's models such as the Malibu and the Monte Carlo harked back to previous design eras without being thoroughly modern. 3. Dodge: \\"Dodge: Bringing the 'Ram' in Ramshackle\\" - A satirical comment on the perceived build quality and durability challenges of Dodge vehicles during the era, even though the Ram pickup was gaining popularity. 4. Cadillac: \\"Cadillac: Because Your Grandpa Needed Something to Drive, Too\\" - Reflecting on Cadillac's image at the time as a brand for an older demographic, with models like the DeVille that featured traditional luxury but weren't seen as cutting edge. 5. Pontiac: \\"Pontiac: We Put the Plastic in Fantastic\\" - Pontiac often used a lot of plastic body cladding during the 90s, particularly on models like the Grand Am and the Trans Sport minivan. 6. Chrysler: \\"Chrysler: Innovating Cup Holders Since the Minivan\\" - Chrysler was known for its family-friendly minivans with a multitude of features, so the slogan pokes fun at innovation being reduced to smaller, comfort-based amenities. 7. Lincoln: \\"Lincoln: Because Nothing Says Luxury Like a Spare Tire on the Trunk\\" - Referring to the classic design feature on cars like the Lincoln Town Car that emulated the look of an external spare tire. Remember, these fictitious slogans are meant to be satirical and are a play on stereotypes and perceptions of the American automotive industry during the late 90s, a period known for a unique mix of innovation and an adherence to tradition."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Hyper-Patriotic American Car Company Slogans During 2002?","output":"During 2002, the United States was still reeling from the events of September 11, 2001. National sentiment was very patriotic and supportive of American values, troops, and businesses. Car companies that sought to tap into this patriotic fervor might have used marketing slogans to emphasize their commitment to the country, to economic recovery, and to unity. Here are several hypothetical slogans that a hyper-patriotic American car company might have used during that time: 1. \\"Built Proud, Built Free - America's Drive.\\" 2. \\"Homegrown Power, Heroic Strength - Drive American.\\" 3. \\"United We Drive - True American Spirit on Four Wheels.\\" 4. \\"Rolling Freedom - Accelerating American Dreams.\\" 5. \\"Harnessing American Heart and Muscle - Drive Bold, Drive Strong.\\" 6. \\"Our Commitment Runs Deep - American Made, American Proud.\\" 7. \\"From Our Home to the Highways - American Glory in Every Ride.\\" 8. \\"Built for the Brave - The Car that Honors America.\\" 9. \\"Driving Forward Together - America's Choice, America's Pride.\\" 10. \\"Liberty on Wheels - The Power of American Engineering.\\" These slogans would likely be paired with advertising campaigns featuring American flags, imagery of eagles, and scenes evoking family, freedom, and national landmarks to deepen the emotional connection.

Imagine you're looking for innovative ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Traditional suggestions often include reducing meat consumption, using public transportation, and cutting down on single-use plastics. While these are absolutely valuable, let’s consider some alternative suggestions: 1. **Adopting a Capsule Wardrobe**: - Minimalism in fashion can significantly cut down on consumer waste. - Techniques: - Choose high-quality, versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched. - Limit the number of items to reduce unnecessary laundry loads, saving water and energy. - Opt for natural, biodegradable fabrics to lessen environmental impact when they're eventually discarded. - Methods: - Create seasonal capsule wardrobes to adapt to different weather without having to own excessive clothing. - Perform regular maintenance on clothes to prolong their life, like sewing on buttons or patching holes. - Physical feel-good factor: - Wearing natural fibers like organic cotton or bamboo can be more breathable and comfortable against the skin. 2. **DIY Natural Cleaners**: - Creating your own cleaning products reduces the need for plastic packaging and chemical use. - Techniques: - Use everyday household items like vinegar, baking soda, and citrus as base ingredients. - Experiment with essential oils for natural fragrance and additional cleaning properties. - Methods: - Repurpose old containers to store homemade cleaners. - Make cleaners in small batches to avoid waste and ensure freshness. - Physical feel-good factor: - Natural cleaners are less likely to cause skin irritations or allergic reactions common with chemical cleaners. 3. **Urban Gardening with a Twist**: - Utilize unconventional spaces to grow plants and vegetables to reduce food miles. - Techniques: - Employ vertical gardening to maximize space usage – grow up walls or create a green rooftop. - Investigate hydroponic or aquaponic systems for soil-less cultivation in small spaces. - Methods: - Companion planting to naturally keep pests away and promote healthy growth without chemicals. - Collect and use rainwater for irrigation to conserve water. - Physical feel-good factor: - Interacting with plants and soil can increase serotonin production and lower stress levels. 4. **Social Carpooling with a Purpose**: - Enhance traditional carpooling by combining it with social or community events. - Techniques: - Organize carpool groups for attending events like concerts, festivals, or sports games to reduce individual car usage. - Use social media or specialized apps to easily plan and connect with nearby potential carpoolers. - Methods: - Incorporate a system for rotating drivers to share responsibility and reduce individual fuel costs. - Schedule regular 'car-free' days where all members of the carpooling community aim to use only public transport or cycles. - Physical feel-good factor: - Social interactions during travel can improve mood and provide networking opportunities. Remember, any alternative idea is worth contemplating if it brings us closer to our goal of sustainability.

This value is often referred to as the \\"exit status\\" or \\"return code.\\" The conventions for these codes are that returning \`0\` indicates success and returning a non-zero value indicates some type of error or failure. In the context of your code: - The \`return 0;\` statement inside the for-loop is executed when the searched name is found, and it exits the main function immediately, indicating a successful execution (i.e., the search was successful). - The final \`return 1;\` statement is placed after the for-loop has completed without finding the name, which signals that the program has run to completion but did not successfully find what it was looking for, hence it returns an error code (in this case, \`1\`). It is worth noting that if your \`main\` function reaches the end without an explicit \`return\` statement, the compiler will implicitly add a \`return 0;\` at the end of the main function (since C99). However, it's considered good practice to include an explicit \`return\` statement to clearly indicate the success or failure of your program. In some programming environments and older C standards, omitting the return statement in \`main\` might result in an undefined return code."},{"instruction":"What happens if I remove the return 0","output":"Removing the \`return 0;\` from inside your for-loop has a couple of implications. Firstly, let's look at what happens when you remove the \`return 0;\` after the found message is printed: \`\`\`c if (strcmp(people[i].name, name) == 0) { printf(\\"Found %sn\\", people[i].number); // return 0; // This line is removed } \`\`\` If the code finds the matching name, it will print the \\"Found\\" message and then continue executing the rest of the main function. Since there are no other actions after the for-loop other than the final \`printf(\\"Not foundn\\");\` and \`return 1;\`, those statements will get executed even after finding the correct person. This means your function will: 1. Print \\"Found\\" followed by the phone number. 2. After the for-loop exits, it will print \\"Not found\\". 3. Then it will return \`1\` indicating an error or unsuccessful completion even though the search was successful. This is obviously not the intended behavior as you want the program to terminate indicating success once the person is found. You want to make sure you exit the main function immediately after a successful search, and for that, you should have a return statement that stops the execution. If you only remove the final \`return 1;\` from the end of the main function, it effectively changes the meaning of your program's exit status when no match is found. According to the C99 standard and later, if the main function finishes without encountering a \`return\` statement, the program implicitly returns \`0\`, which generally signals successful completion. That said, this may lead to ambiguity since returning \`0\` no longer distinguishes between finding a name and not finding it; both outcomes would return \`0\` with the removal of the \`return 1;\`. In summary, without the \`return 0;\`, your program does not behave as intended upon a successful name match, as it won't immediately terminate, and it will also misreport the success status if the \`return 1;\` is also omitted. It is essential to use return statements correctly to reflect the success or failure of the operations your program is carrying out."},{"instruction":"I still don't get why you have to include return 0. Please explain it in easy terms","output":"Let's put it in very simple terms: Imagine your program as a worker who's been asked to find someone's phone number in a small address book. When the worker finds the number, they should immediately stop looking (because the job is done) and say \\"I did it!\\" before leaving. If the worker doesn't find the number, they will go through the whole address book, tell you \\"Sorry, couldn't find it,\\" and then leave looking a bit unhappy. In programming: - Saying \\"I did it!\\" is like returning \`0\`. It's a way for the worker (your program) to tell you (or the computer) that everything went as expected. - Looking unhappy and saying \\"Sorry, couldn't find it,\\" is like returning \`1\`. It's a way for the worker to tell you that they didn't accomplish what you asked for. So in your code: - \`return 0;\` is used right after you found the number to make the program immediately stop and report that it was successful. Without this, the program wouldn't stop; it would keep running the rest of the code, which isn't what you want when you've already found what you were looking for. - \`return 1;\` is used at the end because, if the program checks both people and doesn't find the number, it should end and let you know that the search was unsuccessful. If you remove \`return 0;\` from your program, it's like your worker forgets to say \\"I did it!\\" even when they’ve successfully found the number. This can confuse you because you won't be able to tell whether the worker was successful or not just by the end reaction, which would be the same regardless of the outcome."},{"instruction":"What if in in for loop i cange it to return 1","output":"If you change the \`return 0;\` to \`return 1;\` inside the for-loop, like this: \`\`\`c if (strcmp(people[i].name, name) == 0) { printf(\\"Found %sn\\", people[i].number); return 1; // Changed from return 0 to return 1 } \`\`\` Now when the program finds the matching name, it will: 1. Print \\"Found\\" followed by the phone number. 2. Return \`1\`, indicating that an error has occurred or the task was unsuccessful. However, this is not the standard way to use return codes. By convention, a return code of \`0\` indicates success. That means if you use \`return 1;\` here, it wrongly signals that your program failed to find the matching name, even though it actually succeeded. So while technically you can do this switch, it would not follow the common practice, and it would be misleading to anyone reading or using your program. Users and other programs that might interact with yours expect a return code of \`0\` for success, so it's best to keep with the standard and use \`return 0;\` when the name is found."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular Valentines, one word only and add Valentines before the word","output":"Valentines Chocolate"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artValentines Chocolate","output":"Valentines Chocolate | Love-Themed Art Perfect for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Unique Gift for Romance and Sweethearts"},{"instruction":"TRANSLATE: [FSDSS-738] 愛する妻を喪った寂しさに負けてもえ（義妹）と何度も、何度も、セックスしてしまった…。 天使もえ [FSDSS-748] 元地方局アナウンサーがはじめての禁欲からの性欲解放もの凄いグラインド騎乗位 森あやみ [STARS-984] 芸能人 矢埜愛茉 AV DEBUT [ZMAR-105] まるっと！瞳リョウ","output":"Please be aware that I cannot provide translations or descriptions of adult content.

It normalizes the data according to the specified minimum and maximum values, scales it to be within the range [0, 255], changes the data type to 32-bit floating point, and reshapes it so that it has a single channel along the first dimension (useful for some machine learning libraries like PyTorch). The function appears to be part of a data pre-processing pipeline for image processing. Below is a detailed breakdown of the function: 1. \`data_min, data_max = minmax\`: Unpack the tuple \`minmax\` into \`data_min\` and \`data_max\`, which are expected to be the minimum and maximum values for normalization. 2. \`data = np.clip(data, data_min, data_max)\`: Clip the input data so that all elements below \`data_min\` are set to \`data_min\` and all above \`data_max\` are set to \`data_max\`. This ensures that the data is within the specified range. 3. \`data = (data - data_min) / (data_max - data_min)\`: Normalize the data to be in the range [0, 1] using the provided minimum and maximum values. 4. \`data = data.astype(np.float32)\`: Convert the data type of the array to 32-bit floating point. This can help reduce memory usage if the original data type was of higher precision (e.g., float64). 5. \`data = data*255.0\`: Scale the normalized data to be in the range [0, 255] by multiplying it by 255. This is typically done when preparing data for image processing tasks, as image data is often represented in this range for each channel. 6. \`data = np.transpose(np.expand_dims(data, 2), (2, 0, 1))\`: Change the shape of the data. First, \`np.expand_dims(data, 2)\` adds a new dimension at the third axis (index 2), effectively converting a 2D array into a 3D array with a single channel. Then \`np.transpose(..., (2, 0, 1))\` reorders the dimensions so that the single channel comes first. The final shape of the array will have dimensions corresponding to \`(channels, height, width)\`, which is a common format for convolutional neural networks. Make sure that you have NumPy library imported by including \`import numpy as np\` at the beginning of your code to use the function. Here is an example of how you might use this function: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Example data and minmax values data = np.array([[0, 100, 200], [200, 150, 50]]) minmax = (0, 200) # Normalize the data normalized_data = normalize(data, minmax) print(normalized_data) \`\`\` This code would output the normalized data with the structure suitable for input into a convolutional neural network."},{"instruction":"what are cold/ sore throat/ viral remedies that rooted in science that work","output":"While there is no cure for the common cold or a viral sore throat, there are remedies that can help alleviate symptoms and possibly shorten the duration of the illness. Here are some remedies that are supported by scientific evidence: 1. Hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids such as water, herbal teas, and broths can help to maintain hydration and soothe a sore throat. 2. Saltwater gargle: Gargling with warm salt water can reduce throat inflammation and discomfort. Mix about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water. 3. Honey: Honey has natural antimicrobial properties and can soothe a sore throat. It can be taken by the spoonful, mixed into tea, or used with other remedies. Do note that honey should not be given to children under the age of 1 due to the risk of botulism. 4. Rest: Getting adequate rest is essential when fighting off a viral infection. 5. Zinc: Zinc lozenges or syrup may reduce the duration of a cold if taken within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. However, high doses of zinc can cause side effects and should not be used for more than a few days. 6. Vitamin C: While Vitamin C has not been conclusively shown to prevent colds, there's some evidence that it may reduce the duration and severity of colds if taken regularly. 7. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: Decongestants, antihistamines, and pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve symptoms. However, these medications do not cure the cold; they only provide symptomatic relief. 8. Nasal irrigation or neti pots: Rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution can help with decongestion and remove irritants. 9. Mentholated ointments: Applying these to the chest and throat can help relieve congestion and make breathing easier. 10. Humidifiers: Using a humidifier to add moisture to the air can reduce nasal congestion and soothe dry throats. It's important to note that while these remedies may provide symptom relief, they are not substitutes for professional medical treatment. If symptoms are severe or persistent, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. Additionally, some of the remedies may not be suitable for everyone, particularly children, pregnant women, or people with certain health conditions. Always check with a healthcare provider if you are uncertain about the safety or appropriateness of a remedy."},{"instruction":"buatkan saya cerita fiksi terdapat orientasi, rangkaian peristiwa, komplikasi dan resolusi","output":"Judul: Pencuri Waktu Orientasi: Di kota kecil bernama Tempon, hiduplah seorang remaja cerdik bernama Alvin. Kota itu dikenal unik karena penduduknya menjalani kehidupan yang sangat teratur berkat penemuan canggih, Jam Pusat Tempon, yang mengatur waktu di seluruh kota. Jam ini tidak hanya menunjukkan waktu, tetapi juga mengontrol aliran waktu sehingga semua aktivitas berjalan dengan sempurna. Rangkaian Peristiwa: Alvin, yang selalu penasaran dengan teknologi, menemukan rumor tentang artefak kuno yang disebut 'Pencuri Waktu'. Menurut legenda, artefak itu dapat memanipulasi waktu, memperlambat atau mempercepat sesuai keinginan pemiliknya. Terpesona oleh legenda ini, Alvin memutuskan untuk menemukan artefak saingan Jam Pusat kota itu. Dia mulai pencariannya dengan mencari tahu lebih banyak tentang sejarah kota di perpustakaan kota. Ia menemukan sebuah catatan kuno yang merujuk pada lokasi tersembunyi di perbukitan Tempon, di mana artefak tersebut dianggap terpendam. Dibakar oleh rasa penasaran, Alvin mempersiapkan dirinya dengan berbagai alat dan memetakan rute ke bukit tersebut. Komplikasi: Alvin tiba di tempat yang ditunjukkan peta. Setelah berjam-jam menggali, ia menemukan artefak tersebut: sebuah jam pasir antik dengan kualitas aneh dan mempesona. Saat ia membalikkannya, secara tak terduga, aliran waktu di sekitarnya mulai berfluktuasi. Di kota, Jam Pusat Tempon menjadi tidak stabil, dan kehidupan sehari-hari penduduk kota mulai berantakan. Lampu lalu lintas berubah secara acak, memicu kekacauan di jalan; orang-orang mendadak menua atau kembali mudah tanpa penjelasan; dan aliran waktu menjadi tidak terprediksi, memicu kepanikan. Resolusi: Merasa bertanggung jawab atas kekacauan itu, Alvin segera berusaha memperbaiki kesalahannya. Dia berusaha untuk memahami fungsi artefak tersebut dan menemukan cara untuk mengembalikan waktu kembali ke jalurnya. Dengan bantuan seorang penemu tua yang mengetahui lebih banyak tentang Jam Pusat Tempon, dia belajar bahwa kedua alat itu harus disinkronkan untuk memulihkan keteraturan. Setelah serangkaian eksperimen dan kesalahan, Alvin akhirnya berhasil. Dengan hati-hati, dia menyesuaikan jam pasir 'Pencuri Waktu' dengan Jam Pusat Tempon dan berhasil menyinkronkannya, memulihkan waktu kembali ke keadaan semula. Penduduk kota menyadari nilai kehidupan yang teratur dan peran penting Jam Pusat Tempon, sementara Alvin belajar bahwa beberapa rahasia mungkin lebih baik tetap tersembunyi. Jam pasir kembali ditanam di dalam bumi bukit Tempon, di lokasi yang hanya diketahui oleh Alvin dan penemu tua itu. Mereka berdua berjanji untuk menjaga rahasia tersebut tetap aman, sambil Alvin mendapatkan pelajaran berharga tentang keseimbangan dan tanggung jawab atas penemuan."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

To simulate 30 days' worth of stock prices in ClojureScript, we can create a function that generates random prices based on a starting price and fluctuates the price by a random percentage each day. Below is an example of such a function using ClojureScript: \`\`\`clojure (ns stock-price-generator.core) (defn generate-stock-prices \\"Generates 30 days' worth of stock prices, given an initial price.\\" [initial-price] (let [days 30 max-change-percentage 0.05] ; maximum daily percentage change (up or down) (take days (iterate (fn [price] (let [change-factor (+ 1 (- (* 2 (rand)) max-change-percentage))] ; random factor between 1-max_change_percentage and 1+max_change_percentage (* price change-factor))) initial-price)))) ;; Example usage: (def initial-price 100.00) ; Let's suppose the stock starts at 100.00 (println (generate-stock-prices initial-price)) \`\`\` In this snippet: - \`generate-stock-prices\` is a function that takes an \`initial-price\` argument. - The variable \`days\` is set to 30, indicating the number of days for which we want to generate prices. - The variable \`max-change-percentage\` determines the maximum percentage change (increase or decrease) in stock price between successive days. - The \`take\` function is used to limit the generated sequence to 30 entries. - The \`iterate\` function generates an infinite sequence of stock prices, starting with the initial price and applying a randomly calculated change factor each day. - The \`change-factor\` is calculated to be a random value between \`1 - max-change-percentage\` and \`1 + max-change-percentage\`. This value when multiplied by \`price\` results in a new price within ±5% of the previous day's price. - An example usage of this function is provided, where we define \`initial-price\` as 100.00 and print out the generated sequence of prices. When running this code in a ClojureScript environment, you should see a console output of 30 days' worth of simulated stock prices, starting with the initial price and fluctuating randomly within the defined range each day."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Sarcastic American TV Network Slogans That Are Based On Their Ratings During 1980?","output":"Sure, imagining sarcastic slogans for American TV networks based on their ratings during the 1980s—when networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC dominated the airwaves—is a playful exercise in retroactive humor.

There are also references to a library called \\"ApexCharts\\", which seems to be used for rendering various chart types in React-based applications. Additionally, there is use of \`js/Date.\` and \`js/moment\`, which indicates the use of native JavaScript Date objects and the Moment.js library, respectively, for handling dates and times. In your code, you have a combination of data generation functions, state definitions (like atoms for reactive state management in Reagent), and components, which are functions that return hiccup-like syntax representing React elements. The data generation functions create random data to simulate profits for teams across various periods. You have several chart functions that produce different types of charts (e.g., pie-chart, scatter-chart, radar-chart, etc.) using the generated data. The \`def\` expressions are defining atoms to hold state, and the \`defn\` expressions are defining functions or components. The code is not complete in the sense that it has placeholder text for things like \`inv/monthly-revenue-breakdown\` and \`inv/service-revenue\`, which suggest there are external namespaces or APIs (\`inv\`) that would be providing these data but are not included in the code snippet. Also, there are no explicit \`ns\` (namespace) declarations shown, which typically appear at the beginning of a Clojure/ClojureScript file to specify the namespace and required libraries.

For Node.js, you might utilize other HTTP libraries available through npm. Please note that scraping data from websites could violate their terms of service. Always make sure you have permission to scrape data from a website and respect their \`robots.txt\` file. To demonstrate how to format stock data into the desired structure, below is a basic example using ClojureScript and assuming you have access to an API endpoint that returns stock prices in JSON format. In this example, I'll assume the endpoint returns data in the following shape: \`\`\`json [ {\\"open\\": 6629.81, \\"high\\": 6650.5, \\"low\\": 6623.04, \\"close\\": 6633.33}, // ... more daily stock data ] \`\`\` Here's the ClojureScript code to transform this into your required format: \`\`\`clojure (defn parse-stock-data [stock-data] (map-indexed (fn [idx day] {:x (inc idx) :y [(day \\"open\\") (day \\"high\\") (day \\"low\\") (day \\"close\\")]}) stock-data)) (defn fetch-stock-prices [url] (let [response (js/fetch url) ;; Assuming the data is returned as a JSON array stock-data (-> response (.json))] (parse-stock-data stock-data))) ;; Example usage: ;; (fetch-stock-prices \\"https://api.example.com/stock_prices\\") \`\`\` In the \`fetch-stock-prices\` function: - We call \`js/fetch\` with the URL of the API endpoint. - We chain a call to \`.json\` on the response to parse the JSON. - We pass the parsed data to \`parse-stock-data\`, which uses \`map-indexed\` to transform each object into the format you require. This code will not work as a standalone example because it does not handle promises (\`js/fetch\` returns a promise) or any errors that may occur during the request. In a production setting, you should handle the asynchronous nature of JavaScript's \`fetch\` API properly with \`then\` and \`catch\` for promise resolution and error handling, or you could use async/await if you are transpiling your ClojureScript code. Moreover, due to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies, if you are making these requests from the browser, you'll need to ensure that the endpoint supports CORS or use a server-side proxy to make the requests."},{"instruction":"Bạn có thể cập nhật dữ liệu cho các câu trả lời đến năm bao nhiêu","output":"Kho kiến thức của tôi cập nhật cho đến đầu năm 2023.

Merkel endings: • They are mechanoreceptors (prolonged touch or pressure on the skin). •They are present in the epidermis of the skin of palm and sole. •The nerve loses its myelin sheath and form a disc like expansion under Merkel cell near the base of epidermis..3.Peritrichial nerve endings: • Free nerve endings incorporated in the hair follicles that respond to touch and movement of hair (mechanoreceptors). 4.Neuroepithelim endings: • • • Taste buds in tongue for taste. Organ of Corti in ear for hearing. Macula utriculi, macula sacculi and cristae ampullaris for equilibrium ♦Retina of eye. ♦ Olfactory epithelium of noseB- Effectors: These are autonomic nerve endings supplying glandular epithelium as lacrimal and salivary glands. The umyelinated nerve fibres form networks just outside the basal lamina of the epithelium. From there, branches penetrate the lamina and end between the bases of the glandular cells.Nerve Endings in Connective Tissue All are receptors; 1 -Free nerve endings: 2-Meissner's corpuscle: 3-Krause's end bulb: 4-Ruffini's end organ: 5-Pacinian corpuscle: 6-Golgi tendon organ (Tendon spindle):Nerve Endings in Connective Tissue : All are receptors; 1 - Free nerve endings: • Similar to those in epithelium. • Present in the dermis of skin and stroma of cornea. 2- Meissner's corpuscle: • Encapsulated, pear shaped. • In dermal papillae of skin that is especially sensitive as tips of fingers. • The axon enters the corpuscle after losing its myelin and spirals up between the cell layers until it ends at the upper pole of corpuscle. • It is a mechanorector (touch). 3-Krause's end bulb: • Encapsulated, spherical bodies. • Deep in the dermis of skin. • The axon enters the corpuscle after losing its myelin and branches repeatedly inside. • It is a mechanorector (touch).Nerve Endings in Connective Tissue 4-Ruffini's end organ: • Encapsulated, fusiform bodies. • Deep in dermis of skin especially in sole. • The axon enters the capsule after losing myelin sheath & branches between parallel collagen fibres inside. • It is a mechanoreceptor that responds to tension forces. 5-Golgi tendon organ (Tendon spindle): • Proprioceptor nerve ending in tendons near the insertion sites of muscle fibres. • It is formed of connective tissue sheath surrounding large bundles of collagen fibres that are continuous with the collagen fibres of tendon. • Sensory nerve penetrates the capsule to end around the collagen bundles. • Collects information about difference in tension among tendons and relays data to CNS to help in coordination of muscular contraction.Nerve Endings in Connective Tissue Pacinian corpuscle: •Encapsulated, large ovoid up to 1 mm in length. •In dermis and hypodermis of skin, periosteum of bone, joint capsule and in connective tissue of some organs as pancreas. •It has a thin connective tissue capsule enclosing 20-60 concentric lamellae consisting of very thin flat cells (probably modified Schwann cells) separated by narrow spaces filled with gel like material.

A colorless, tasteless, and inodorous substance, water is fundamental, blanketing roughly 71% of our planet's surface in its liquid, solid (ice), and gaseous (vapor) forms. Indispensable to all life forms, it supports biological functions, underpins ecosystems, and contributes to human society. The molecular polarity of H2O imparts remarkable characteristics such as its ability to retain heat, its surface tension, and its capacity to dissolve many substances. The water cycle, with processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and accumulation, governs its natural circulation. Ensuring access to potable water is a dire global challenge affecting health, farming, and industrial sectors. 2. Covering approximately 71% of Earth, water is an essential substance devoid of color, taste, or smell. It manifests in liquid, solid (ice), and vapor forms. All life relies on water for survival, influencing biological activity, ecological balance, and societal development. Its polar H2O molecules endow it with distinctive features, such as thermal retention, cohesive surface, and solvency. Water perpetually moves through the environment via the hydrologic cycle, which includes stages like evaporation, condensation, falling as precipitation, and pooling. The pursuit of purified water access is a paramount concern, entwined with public health, agriculture, and manufacturing. 3. Water—a clear, neutral, and unscented fundamental substance—occupies over two-thirds of Earth's exterior in multiple forms: aqueous, icy, and vaporous. Pivotal for every life form, water is integral to organism growth, ecological stability, and human progress. Traits like considerable heat capacity, surface tension, and solvent efficacy derive from its polar molecular composition. Through cyclical phases of evaporation, condensation, depositing as precipitation, and gathering, it journeys through the biosphere. The availability of uncontaminated water is a pressing issue, with significant repercussions for healthiness, cultivation, and commerce. 4. Constituting nearly three-fourths of Earth’s face, water is a clear, bland, and nonscented elemental resource, appearing as liquid, ice, and vapor. Vital to every known life species, its role is central in cellular activities, sustaining ecosystems, and shaping civilizations. Water's distinctive high heat capacity, tensile strength at surfaces, and dissolving power are thanks to its polar H2O molecules. Through the water cycle stages—vaporization, cloud formation, raining down, and collecting—water recirculates in our environment. The quest for sanitary water is a top priority, interconnected with our wellbeing, food production, and industries. 5. Water, an indispensable and transparent liquid without taste or scent, blankets 71% of the Earth in its three states—fluid, frozen, and vaporous.

It's important to clarify that this is a satirical and fictional take on car company slogans that could reflect public perceptions or common criticisms of the quality of American car brands around the year 2001. These slogans are not real and are created for entertainment purposes: 1. Ford - \\"Built Ford Tough? More Like Built to Rust!\\" Meaning: Playing on Ford's real slogan, \\"Built Ford Tough,\\" this parody suggests that Ford vehicles might be more prone to rust and reliability issues than boasting toughness. 2. Chevrolet - \\"Chevy: Like a Rock, Stuck in the Shop.\\" Meaning: Chevrolet's real slogan, \\"Like a Rock,\\" is twisted here to imply that Chevy's cars are often in need of repairs and spend more time in the service center than on the road. 3. Chrysler - \\"Chrysler: Engineered to Stand Out, Especially on the Tow Truck.\\" Meaning: Suggesting that Chrysler vehicles are more likely to break down and be seen on the back of a tow truck rather than for their design or performance. 4. Dodge - \\"Grab Life by the Steering Recall.\\" Meaning: A play on Dodge's slogan, \\"Grab Life by the Horns,\\" this version insinuates that Dodge vehicles may have faced steering-related recalls affecting their reliability. 5. Cadillac - \\"Cadillac: Break Through... Your Monthly Repair Budget.\\" Meaning: Rather than breaking through in terms of luxury or innovation, this spoof suggests that owning a Cadillac might involve unexpected and costly repairs. 6. Pontiac - \\"Pontiac: Fuel for the Soul, Tow for the Whole Car.\\" Meaning: Twisting the actual slogan, \\"Fuel for the Soul,\\" the parody suggests that while Pontiacs might excite the owner emotionally, they'll also require towing due to breakdowns. 7. Oldsmobile - \\"This is Not Your Father's Oldsmobile; It's Everyone's Mechanic's.\\" Meaning: A spin on the real slogan intended to modernize Oldsmobile's image, this joke implies that the car is frequently in need of a mechanic's attention rather than being an improvement on the past. 8. Hummer - \\"Hummer: Go Anywhere, As Long As There's a Service Center Nearby.\\" Meaning: While Hummers were marketed as rugged off-road vehicles, this spoof suggests reliability issues might necessitate close proximity to a repair shop. 9. Lincoln - \\"Lincoln: What a Luxury Car Should Be... Once the Recalls are Done.\\" Meaning: Poking fun at Lincoln's aspiration to be the epitome of luxury, suggesting that achieving true luxury status is hampered by numerous recalls. 10. Saturn - \\"Saturn: A Different Kind of Car, A Familiar Kind of Repair Bill.\\" Meaning: Despite Saturn's original selling point of being a \\"different kind of car company,\\" the satire hints that their repair bills might not have been as revolutionary. Remember, these slogans are strictly intended for humor and are not based on factual information or current quality standards of these car companies. These slogans do not reflect the actual state or quality of these car brands during or after 2001."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Chrysler Corporation Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 1988?","output":"Sure! Keep in mind that these satirical slogans are entirely fictional and exaggerate the stereotype of vehicle quality challenges faced by the Chrysler Corporation around 1988 for the sake of humor. They are not reflective of the actual company slogans or necessarily indicative of the true quality of Chrysler vehicles at that time. 1. Chrysler: \\"We're Like a Box of Chocolates - You Never Know What You're Gonna Get.\\" Meaning: Parodying the famous line from the movie \\"Forrest Gump,\\" this slogan pokes fun at the potential inconsistency in vehicle quality and performance. 2. Dodge: \\"If You Can Dodge a Wrench, You Can Fix a Dodge.\\" Meaning: A play on words suggesting that some Dodge vehicles of the time may require frequent repairs, much like the saying about dodging balls in the game of dodgeball. 3. Plymouth: \\"Plymouth: Rediscover the Great Indoors of Our Service Centers.\\" Meaning: This slogan satirizes the idea that Plymouth owners might spend more time enjoying the amenities of the dealership's service department than driving their cars. 4. Jeep: \\"Jeep: Adventure is Waiting... Right After This Quick Repair Break.\\" Meaning: While Jeeps have always been associated with adventure, this spoof implies that reliability issues might interrupt your off-road escapades. 5. Eagle: \\"Eagle - Taking You Places You've Never Been (Like Our Meeting with the Mechanic).\\" Meaning: A humorous take on the concept that driving an Eagle could lead to new experiences, such as frequent trips to fix issues that you might not have anticipated. Remember, these are just creative parodies and are not indicative of every customer's experience with Chrysler Corporation vehicles during that era. The automotive industry has evolved significantly since then, and many of the brands mentioned have also undergone substantial changes, with some no longer in production."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1986?","output":"Certainly! American Motors Corporation (AMC), known for cars that often went against the grain of typical American car design, had a distinctive niche in the automotive industry during the 1980s. Below are some satirical slogans that playfully critique AMC’s design decisions in 1986, just for a bit of fun: 1. AMC: \\"Dare to be Different... Like, Really Different.\\" Meaning: A humorous nod to AMC's unique design choices, which frequently set it apart from the more mainstream offerings from other American automakers. 2. Eagle: \\"Eagle - The Car That's Part Sedan, Part Hiking Boot.\\" Meaning: The AMC Eagle was known for its four-wheel-drive capability, an unusual feature for passenger cars of the time, giving it a rugged, almost outdoorsy shoe appearance. 3. Gremlin: \\"Gremlin: It's Not Just a Mythical Creature Anymore.\\" Meaning: A play on the word \\"Gremlin,\\" inferring that like the folklore, AMC's Gremlin was a bit peculiar and notorious in its own way. 4. Pacer: \\"Pacer: Because Who Needs Aerodynamics Anyway?\\" Meaning: AMC's Pacer had a distinctive, wide stance with a fishbowl-like glass area, poking fun at its non-conventional design and suboptimal aerodynamics. 5. Matador: \\"Matador: The Car that Charges Ahead... in Style?\\" Meaning: The AMC Matador, whose name evokes images of bravery and bulls, is ironically teased here for pushing forward with a design that might have been perceived as less than stylish. 6. AMC Spirit: \\"Spirit: Unleashing the Soul of American Ingenuity (and Peculiarity).\\" Meaning: Though the name suggests vigor and American creativity, this slogan hints that the car's design might be ingeniously unconventional. 7. Concord: \\"Concord: First-Class Travel, Economy Design.\\" Meaning: While \\"Concord\\" suggests luxury and lofty ambitions, this satirical tagline implies a discrepancy between the name's promise and the vehicle's actual design flair. Remember, these fictional slogans reflect the sometimes quirky and unique design ethos of AMC vehicles that appealed to a particular niche in the market. The 1986 model year was among the final years for AMC before being acquired by Chrysler in 1987."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Stellantis Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 1985 (Despite the fact that they Didn't Exist In 1985)?","output":"Indeed, Stellantis did not exist in 1985; it's a multinational automotive manufacturing corporation formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Groupe PSA. However, for a playful thought experiment, we can create satirical slogans that could have theoretically been applied to the individual brands that now make up Stellantis, considering their 1985 reputations. It's key to note this would have been two separate entities at the time: Chrysler Corporation on one side and the PSA Group on the other, with Fiat as its own entity. Chrysler: 1. Chrysler: \\"When You Aim for the Stars, Sometimes You Land in the Shop.\\" Meaning: Even with lofty ambitions and designs, Chrysler vehicles were stereotypically considered to require frequent maintenance. Dodge: 2. Dodge: \\"Grab Life by the Dipstick!\\" Meaning: Playing on Dodge's more modern tagline \\"Grab Life,\\" suggesting that you might have to check the oil more often than you'd like. Plymouth: 3.

How would you teach it? I would like to let you know that required course content isn't meant to be literal but is all about the intepretation so I would include as many topic as possible that relate to the required course content: Required Course Content: ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M","output":"Based on the required course content you've provided, which revolves around the mole concept in chemistry, I would design the instructional strategy as follows: **Introduction to the Mole Concept:** - Begin by introducing the concept of the mole as a fundamental unit in chemistry, much like the dozen is used to count eggs. - Explain that the mole is a bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic world we can measure. - Illustrate this with everyday examples (e.g., a dozen, a ream of paper, etc.) to ensure students understand why such a unit is necessary. **Discussion on Measuring Atoms and Molecules:** - Discuss the challenges of counting atoms and molecules directly due to their minuscule size and vast numbers. - Explain the practicality of using mass as a means to count them indirectly. - Introduce Avogadro's number as the determining factor of how many particles are in one mole. **Interactive Lecture on Avogadro’s Number:** - Delve into the history and significance of Avogadro’s number, tying it to Amedeo Avogadro's contribution to chemistry. - Use visuals, animations, or models to represent the concept of 6.022 × 10^23 particles. - Provide different examples to showcase the sheer size of Avogadro’s number. **Connecting Mass, Moles, and Number of Atoms:** - Teach the conceptual bridge between atomic mass units (amu), molar mass, and the mass of a sample. - Emphasize that 1 mole of any substance has a mass in grams equal to its atomic or molecular weight in amu. - Use periodic tables, charts, and examples to practice the conversion between amu and grams per mole. **Dimensional Analysis and Mole Calculations:** - Introduce dimensional analysis as a tool for converting between different units using conversion factors. - Practice calculations converting between mass, moles, and number of particles, illustrating the steps clearly with worked examples. - Provide tips and tricks for students to remember key concepts (e.g., \\"One mole equals molar mass in grams equals Avogadro's number of particles\\"). **Hands-On Laboratory Work:** - Design lab experiments where students use the mole concept to determine the quantity of substances. - Develop a lab where students determine the empirical formula of a compound from mass measurements. - Include a stoichiometry lab experiment to visualize the reactants-to-products relationship using the mole concept. **Assessment and Application:** - Use formative assessments like quizzes and practice problems to ensure students grasp the mole calculations. - Assign real-world applications such as calculating the amount of a drug in a medicinal dose or the amount of reactants needed for a chemical reaction. - Use summative assessments such as tests or a project to evaluate students’ understanding and ability to apply the mole concept to various situations. **Review and Reinforcement:** - Review key concepts periodically and offer supplemental materials for students who need additional assistance. - Provide reinforcement through group work, peer teaching, and interactive games or activities to consolidate learning. Overall, the instructional approach is varied to cater to different learning styles, and it's scaffolded to progressively build upon the students' understanding of the mole concept, from foundational knowledge to practical application."},{"instruction":"中华民国时期民国政府对于双国籍的态度是什么样的","output":"中华民国成立初期，并没有立即形成一套完整的国籍法。关于双国籍（或双重国籍）的政策与态度，主要是在国籍法制定之后才逐步明确的。 中华民国的国籍问题，一方面受到了传统的国族观念的影响，另一方面则需要适应现代国家法律的要求和国际法的规则。在1929年，中华民国制定了第一部较为系统的国籍法——《中华民国国籍法》。根据1929年的国籍法，中华民国并不承认双重国籍，即原则上一个人不可以同时具有中华民国国籍和其他国的国籍。 此外，这个时期的国籍法比较强调血统原则（jus sanguinis），即一个人的国籍由其父母的国籍决定。同时也有一定的地域原则（jus soli）的成分，即在中华民国境内出生的无国籍人或者不明国籍人可以归化为中华民国国民。 然而，在现实操作中，由于历史背景、政治需要和实际执行难度等原因，双国籍现象在实践中是存在的。特别是在海外华侨中，由于归化、婚姻、出生地等情况，很多华侨可能同时具有中华民国国籍和居住国的国籍。 对于这些现象，民国政府并没有一以贯之的强制执行政策，实际处理往往较为灵活。民国政府在实践中可能会根据国际关系、政治考量和对华侨的依赖程度等因素，在对待双国籍问题上采取不同的态度和策略。例如，在一些国际协议或条约中，中华民国政府可能会就国籍问题作出特殊安排。 综上所述，中华民国时期对于双国籍的法律规定基本是不承认的，但在具体执行和实际操作中，政府的态度和政策可能根据具体情况有所变动和灵活处理。"},{"instruction":"why use chatgpt","output":"Using ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, can be beneficial for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: 1.

Content creation: It can assist with generating ideas, writing articles, creating outlines, or even composing full pieces of content, albeit it might require human editing and verification for accuracy. 6.

Entertainment: It can be used for storytelling, generating jokes, or engaging in creative conversations to entertain users. 9.

It may sometimes generate incorrect or biased information, and its responses should be verified, especially when accuracy is critical. Moreover, it's not a replacement for human interaction or decision-making, particularly in complex or sensitive situations."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about Trump, Biden and Obama fighting Hulk","output":"Once upon a time, in an alternate reality where political disputes were settled in utterly unusual ways, President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, and former President Donald Trump were faced with an unprecedented situation. The Hulk, having been inadvertently teleported from his comic book universe into our reality, was rampaging through the streets of Washington, D.C. Faced with such a muscular green giant, the Secret Service was quickly overwhelmed. As the citizens of the capital city evacuated, the three politicians found themselves evacuating together in a secure, undisclosed bunker. Once they were safe, Obama, ever the orator, spoke first, \\"Gentlemen, we might have our differences, but right now, we need to address the elephant—or should I say, the Hulk—in the room.\\" Biden nodded in agreement, \\"We've got to come together on this. It's a matter of national security.\\" Trump, arms crossed, looked out the bunker’s reinforced window. \\"Look, I've made deals with the best,\\" he claimed. \\"I can negotiate with this Hulk. I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\\" Obama rubbed his chin thoughtfully, \\"I'm not sure he's going to respond to negotiation in the state he's in. We need a strategy that involves less talk and more action.\\" Biden, who had been silent, lost in thought, finally spoke up, \\"Back in my day, we used to settle disputes with a good old-fashioned arm-wrestling match. What if we challenged him to one?\\" The other two looked at him incredulously. Trump scoffed, \\"Joe, this isn't a barroom brawl, and he's the Hulk. Arm-wrestling is a no-go.\\" But then, something clicked. Obama, with a glint in his eye, remarked, \\"Not arm-wrestling, but what about a show of strength? He respects power, right? We just need to figure out how to harness it without turning this city to rubble.\\" With the fate of D.C. hanging in the balance, Trump, Biden, and Obama came up with a plan. They gathered experts to concoct a serum—a one-time-use concoction that would temporarily give them superhuman strength to confront Hulk on more even terms. The three politicians, each with a different approach to leadership and policy, found themselves united by the serum. They each took a dose and felt the power coursing through their veins, their muscles bulging, suits straining at the seams. As they approached the Hulk, they found him uprooting a lamppost, his expression a mix of confusion and anger. \\"Mr. Hulk, sir,\\" Obama began, \\"we'd like to propose a test of strength. If you win, we'll help you find a way home to your world. If we win, you heed our request to calm down and cease destruction.\\" The Hulk, intrigued by the challenge and recognizing the strength in his three opponents, grunted his agreement. The contest began with Trump attempting to match Hulk's feat of lifting a heavy vehicle overhead. While the Hulk effortlessly hoisted a tank, Trump, with his enhanced power, managed to lift a smaller armored vehicle, earning a nod from the green behemoth. Next was Biden’s turn, who chose a tug-of-war with a heavy-duty rope. The Hulk, amused, accepted. The two heaved and strained, earth and gravel churning under their feet. For a moment, the Hulk seemed taken aback by the resistance he was met with, but ultimately, he won with a mighty pull that sent Biden sprawling. It was Obama's turn, and he chose a different path. Rather than a direct contest, Obama eyed a crumbling monument. \\"Let's see who can rebuild, rather than destroy,\\" he suggested with a smile. Together, they worked, using their immense strength not in combat but in construction, reassembling the monument stone by stone. The Hulk, who had only known conflict until then, found solace in this creative act of synergy. As they completed their task, the Hulk's fury subsided. Finally standing as allies rather than adversaries, Trump, Biden, and Obama had together accomplished the unthinkable. They found common ground with the Hulk. Then, with the help of some brilliant minds, they constructed a portal device to return Hulk back to his own universe. As the green Goliath stepped through the portal, he turned back and gave a nod of respect to the three presidents— united not only in their superhuman efforts but also in their dedication to their country's safety and demonstrating that, sometimes, unlikely challenges can lead to the most extraordinary of truces."},{"instruction":"100 dark suspensful anime. no fan service","output":"Creating a list of 100 dark, suspenseful anime without fan service is quite substantial, so I'll provide a curated list below that focuses on dark and suspenseful themes.

The series is known for its unique rotoscoped animation style and its dark psychological themes. It was broadcast in Japan in 2013 and is based on the manga of the same name by Shuzo Oshimi. While the series was somewhat polarizing due to its distinctive animation and its departure from typical anime art styles, it has garnered a cult following for its faithful representation of the manga's unsettling and provocative narrative. For viewers looking for English translations, subtitles are the primary means of enjoying \\"The Flowers of Evil.\\" The subtitled version is available on various streaming platforms, and it's always worth checking for the most current availability, as dub releases can sometimes come years after the original air date."},{"instruction":"is there a fan dub?","output":"Fan dubs, or unofficial voiceovers created by fans rather than professional voice actors, can sometimes exist for anime series that haven't received an official English dub.

If a fan dub were to exist, it would likely be shared on platforms where fan works are common, such as YouTube or certain anime forums. Keep in mind that fan dubs are a gray area legally, as they use the original animation without the rights holders' permission. They can be removed if they infringe on copyright laws.

The amphitheatre twinkles with floating lights, radiating soft hues that dance across the dueling stage, mirroring the excitement of the audience. You, Sapphire, with your flowing robes embedded with sapphires that glimmer in harmony with your eyes, step onto the stage. Confidence radiates from you like a beacon as you prepare to maintain your title as the unrivaled magician of aesthetics. Meanwhile, Lily, clad in a simple robe that belies her emerging talent, gives you a sheepish smile. The rules are simple: ten rounds, ten unique spells, each judged on their beauty and intricacy. No spell may be repeated during this dazzling contest of enchantment. **Your Spellcasting Stats**: - Creativity: 90/100 - Precision: 85/100 - Power: 80/100 - Adaptability: 95/100 **Lily's Initial Stats**: - Creativity: 60/100 - Precision: 50/100 - Power: 40/100 - Adaptability: 70/100 However, unbeknownst to the audience and the judges, Lily mutters the incantation of \\"Chronosymbiosis,\\" a spell that leeches the years off you and bestows them onto herself with every spell you cast. The effects are subtle, yet with each turn, the opposing forces of time will tug at the fabric of your abilities. **Round 1**: \\"Begin!\\" announces the judge, and the duel of glamour is underway. Bold and assured in your prowess, you initiate the contest by conjuring the spell \\"Phoenix Fire.\\" It's a favorite among the crowd, known for its breathtaking display of a firebird taking majestic flight, trailing flames of vibrant hues. However, as you raise your wand and call forth the energies, the spell feels marginally more taxing than usual. **Result**: Your casting is mesmerizing as a phoenix of azure and crimson flames erupts from your wand's tip, ascending with grandeur while the crowd gasps at the spectacle. The spell's beauty is undeniable, earning you high points in creativity and power. Your years of training and experience shine through, and you set the bar high for young Lily.

With each subsequent spell you cast, your knowledge and mastery of the art degrade as you become younger and Lily becomes older and more skilled. She absorbs the magic of the arena, delighting the audience with increasingly impressive displays. The rounds continue, and you must adapt and strategize. Will you choose to cast your most potent spells early, or do you trust in your waning abilities to improvise as your experience ebbs away? Each turn is a gamble against the relentless tide of Lily's surging talents. The tenth round will decide everything. Will the once-mighty Sapphire hold onto her title despite the cunning challenge posed by Lily, or will youth and guile triumph over experience? The audience is at the edge of their seats, for even as you've become a young child in magical prowess, your determination remains unshaken. The grand finale awaits your invocation. **Final Round – Your Cast:** (Insert your chosen spell here) **Result:** With your final effort, you pour what remains of your skill into a spell both pure and profound.

A flurry of vivid flames dance through the air, shifting from crimson to gold as they form the magnificent outline of a phoenix in flight, leaving the audience entraptured.

Lily, meanwhile, visibly grows and her aura fortifies. Momentarily disoriented by the sudden shift in age, she quickly adapts and is ready to respond. As the rounds progress, you'll have to adapt to your diminishing powers and use your experience to outmaneuver the strengthening Lily. What spell will you choose next to captivate the audience and judges, maintaining your title as the Champion of Magic Dueling, while combating the unseen enchantment slowly sapping your prowess?

The spectators wait in suspense, only to witness a spectacle less grand than anticipated. The phoenix formed from flames emerges not with the powerful wingspan it usually would but with a slightly flickering form, its fiery tail not quite capturing the brilliant nuances you are renowned for. Although the performance is still above what one might expect of Lily’s nascent capabilities, the judges give you a lower score than usual, reflecting the subtle deficiencies incurred by Lily's spell. The crowd is visibly charmed but not wholly astonished, as they have come to expect near-perfection from a prodigy like you. You are aware something is amiss but can't pinpoint the source. Performance: Moderately Successful (Your spell comes to life, but with less vibrancy and detail than your normal standard.

Good luck, Sapphire."},{"instruction":"now it's Lily's turn","output":"Round 1: Lily's Response Amidst a growing sense of unease, Sapphire watches with a mix of curiosity and wariness as Lily prepares to cast her retort. Though young and ostensibly less experienced, Lily's eyes gleam with silent confidence—a hint that perhaps she is not quite the underdog everyone assumes. The 6-year-old concentrates, her wand raised with surprising steadiness. In a clear, high-pitched voice, she utters the invocation for the \\"Dewdrop Prism.\\" This spell, while not high in complexity, is designed to impress with its delicate beauty: countless shimmering droplets of water are to swell in the air, each capturing and refracting the light to create a cascade of miniature rainbows. Lily's spell begins to manifest. Each droplet emerges with more vivid clarity and the rainbows with slightly more brilliance than her starting stats would suggest. It is clear that she is benefiting from the spell she clandestinely cast on Sapphire at the duel's commencement. The assembly of spectators, previously biased in favor of Sapphire's anticipated victory, now gasp in delight at the unexpected charm of Lily's spell. While it doesn't rival the more complex \\"Phoenix Fire,\\" the purity and flawless execution of \\"Dewdrop Prism\\" endear Lily to the judges and the crowd. They award her points that reflect both the spell's innate beauty and the potential they now see burgeoning within this tiny mage. Performance: Surprisingly Effective (The simplicity of the spell combined with the faultless execution and Lily's silent ploy of age transference causes the audience and judges to view her performance as remarkably captivating, potentially scoring her higher than expected.) The duel now progresses to the next round, with the air thick with anticipation. Sapphire, feeling the subtle yet unnerving effects of the age-regression spell, must not only show unparalleled ingenuity with her next spell but perhaps also consider countering or uncovering the insidious magic that is slowly sapping her strengths. **Sapphire's Stats Preparing for Round 2:** (After another 10% reduction) - Casting Precision: 73/100 - Spell Complexity: 69/100 - Creativity and Flair: 71.2/100 - Magical Resonance: 74.5/100 - Enchantment Diversity: 64.8/100 **Lily's Stats Preparing for Round 2:** (After another 10% increase) - Casting Precision: 32.6/100 - Spell Complexity: 30.85/100 - Creativity and Flair: 31.9/100 - Magical Resonance: 33.4/100 - Enchantment Diversity: 29/100 Sapphire now prepares for her second spell, aware that the challenge is escalating swiftly."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular big cat animal, one word only","output":"Cheetah"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artCheetah","output":"Cheetah Sprint | Dynamic Animal Art Design | Versatile for Mugs, Shirts, Canvas Prints | Modern Nature-Inspired Decor"},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

Your prowess with spells of splendor and incantations of intrigue is unmatched in the teen division, and your name has become synonymous with the art of magic dueling. **Your Character: Sapphire** - Age: 16 - Experience: A prodigy, having practiced since the age of 4 - Title: Reigning Champion of the Teen Division - Specialty: Glamour and Illusion Magic - Spellcasting Stats (Start of Duel): - Creativity: 95/100 - Precision: 90/100 - Power: 85/100 - Control: 92/100 - Flair: 98/100 **Your Challenger: Lily** - Age: 6 (apparent age at start) - Experience: Mysterious and unknown - Title: The Prodigy Pint-Sized Magician - Specialty: Unrevealed - Spellcasting Stats (Start of Duel): - Creativity: 30% of Sapphire's (28/100 initially) - Precision: 30% of Sapphire's (27/100 initially) - Power: 30% of Sapphire's (26/100 initially) - Control: 30% of Sapphire's (28/100 initially) - Flair: 30% of Sapphire's (29/100 initially) **Setting** The Arcane Coliseum—a place where stars glimmer above an eternal twilight, regardless of the hour. The arena's stands are packed with spectators of all ages and races, their eyes shimmering with anticipation. The air is charged with arcane energy that thrums in rhythmic harmony with the beating hearts of the audience. **The Rules of the Twilight Glamour Challenge** - 10 rounds of spellcasting - Each spell is scored on Creativity, Precision, Power, Control, and Flair - A spell cannot be repeated within the same duel - The highest cumulative score at the end shall declare the victor **The Twist** Unbeknownst to you, and before the duel commences under the watchful eye of the high-magister judge, Lily, with a glint of mischief in her eye, whispers an ancient spell. It is a spell of years—siphoning the experience from you, her opponent, to bolster her own magical reserves with each incantation you cast. For every spell you conjure, you will lose a year of age and proficiency, while Lily will gain that year. As the duel progresses, the challenge will steepen as your stats slip away and hers burgeon. **The Duel Begins** - **Round 1:** - Your move: After a polite bow to your pint-sized challenger, you step forth and weave your hands in an intricate pattern, summoning a cascade of Astral Butterflies that flutter around the arena, their wings painted with the constellations of the night sky. - Stats at End of Round 1: Creativity 94, Precision 89, Power 84, Control 91, Flair 97 (Age regressed to 15) Lily responds with a giggle and a clap, her eyes alight with untamed excitement. She waves her tiny wand, invoking a simple, yet enchanting string of Jade Pearls that dance and loop around the butterflies, complementing your display without outshining it. - **Round 2:** - Your turn. Please state the spell you would like to cast next, and I will narrate the outcome considering your adjusted stats and the difficulty of the scenario."},{"instruction":"For the first round I try to cast Phoenix Fire","output":"- **Round 2: The Phoenix Fire** - Sapphire's Strategy: Seeking to astound the spectators and conjure an image of awe-inspiring beauty, you, Sapphire, focus your intent on the mythic visage of the phoenix. With an elegant swirl of your wand, you aim to summon an ethereal flame that takes the shape of the legendary bird, its fiery plumes shimmering in hues of gold, crimson, and sapphire blue, casting warm, dancing light upon the faces of all who watch. - **Execution**: With a strong flick of the wrist and an invocation in the tongue of the ancient magi, you release your power into the center of the arena. A glow begins, small and humble, but as your will shapes it, the flame bursts forth, a fiery spectacle growing before the audience's eyes. However, as the spell progresses and the flame seeks the shape of the phoenix, you feel a sudden, inexplicable drain on your abilities. - **Sapphire's Scaled Stats After the Age Regression**: Creativity 93, Precision 88, Power 83, Control 90, Flair 96 (Age: 14) - **Outcome**: The phoenix's form takes shape; its wings spread majestically as it begins to soar. Yet, the spell lacks the full precision and control you're known for as the age regression subtly takes its toll. The phoenix's tail feathers are not as intricate as you intended, and its flight, though grand, is not as fluent and mesmerizing. The audience reacts with delight, but the high-magister judge takes note of the minutiae—where once were the deft touches of a seasoned champion, there are slight, unusual imperfections. - **Lily's Turn**: The little competitor, who now resembles someone near her seventh birthday, doesn't attempt to compete with the grandeur of the phoenix. Instead, she casts a spell that causes the light of the room to dim ever so slightly, making the phoenix's flames appear even brighter, thus unexpectedly enhancing your spectacle. The crowd gasps in delight, and although your spell was the center of attention, Lily's cunning use of subtlety garners her a surprising number of points as well. - **Judgement of Round 2**: The scores come in. While the Phoenix Fire was a bold and beautiful choice, the loss of fine control has affected your performance. The judge awards you with high marks for Creativity and Flair, but notes deductions in Precision and Control. Lily's support spell was elemental in its nature, yet her blossoming Precision and Flair earn her praise, narrowingly closing the gap in scores. The duel is heating up, and the challenge is palpable. Sapphire, you realize that your opponent, although young, possesses an uncanny knack for magic that makes this duel anything but predictable.

Lily, on the other hand, is growing into her magic, her spells gaining finesse and strength with every turn. **Final Round — Sapphire's Possible Stats (Depending on Spells Cast)** - Creativity: ~79/100 - Complexity: ~74/100 - Control: ~84/100 - Flair: ~77/100 **Final Round — Lily's Possible Stats (Depending on Spells Cast)** - Creativity: ~38/100 - Complexity: ~36/100 - Control: ~39/100 - Flair: ~37/100 Even in this twisted turn of events, as a champion dueler, you have the tenacity and experience. The question remains, can you overcome this unforeseen challenge? Should you grow suspicious of Lily's burgeoning skills and deduce the cause, you might be able to counteract the \\"Chrono Swap\\" or adapt your strategy to mitigate its effects. As you face the next round, choose your spells wisely and perhaps seek to expose the trickery at hand. Your spell choices will determine whether you can retain your title or if Lily’s subtle sabotage will bring about an upset of the ages in this magical duel of glamour and guile."},{"instruction":"как на keenetic я могу настроить vpn соединение на один хост ?","output":"Для настройки VPN соединения на один хост (конкретный устройство) через Keenetic, вы можете использовать функцию \\"VPN клиент\\" в пользовательском интерфейсе Keenetic.

The door bursts open, and Homelander floats in menacingly, a smirk across his face.* **Homelander:** Well, if it isn't the master of magnetism himself. I've heard you're a tough guy to meet. **Magneto:** (eyes narrowing) What brings a supposed symbol of American virtue beneath the streets and into the company of mutants? **Homelander:** Oh, you know, just curious about the man who thinks he can control the world with his little party tricks. Besides, I've dealt with my fair share of 'supes,' but you, you're something different. **Magneto:** (smirking) Different, yes. I fight for a future where my kind are not persecuted. You seem to bask in the adoration of your kind while instilling fear. **Homelander:** Adoration, fear—it's all control, isn't it? You bend metal; I bend wills. (locks eyes with Magneto) We're not so different, you and I. **Magneto:** (stands up, the metal around the room beginning to vibrate) You are gravely mistaken. I seek liberty for my people; you seek to rule over yours. There is nothing similar in our methods nor our goals. **Homelander:** (laughs) Liberty? Is that what you call it? Looks more like chaos from where I’m standing. But let's not split hairs. We both know power when we see it, and you’ve got it. I can respect that. **Magneto:** Respect is earned, not taken. Something you've yet to understand. But you should be cautious when confronting a man who can rip the iron from your blood without breaking a sweat. **Homelander:** (smile fades, eyes begin to glow) Is that a threat? *A tense silence fills the air, Magneto’s hand raises slightly, feeling the weight of the iron in Homelander’s body. Homelander’s eyes glow brighter, the threat of his heat vision palpable.* **Magneto:** A warning. Just remember, Homelander, in this chess game of powerful beings, you are still a piece, not a player. **Homelander:** (grins) Then let's play, Magneto. Let's play and see who truly controls the board. *As the tension reaches a peak, both men understand the destruction that could ensue from an altercation. Though adversaries in philosophy, they find a moment’s understanding in their mutual recognition of power.* --- This imagined dialogue illustrates the distinct ideologies and characteristic showmanship of both Magneto and Homelander, highlighting their complex personalities and abilities while maintaining the essence of their rivalry."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept.

Her tiny wand glimmers with a strange aura, hinting at untold potential. Round 0 - The Secret Spell: As the duel commences, unbeknownst to the crowd and Sapphire, Lily utters a whisper-like incantation. A subtle glow surrounds both duelists, quickly fading to nothingness.

The fiery feathers shift through a spectrum of red, orange, and gold, shedding ethereal embers that transform into tiny birds only to vanish in puffs of smoky sparks. Performance Outcome: - Due to your high initial stats, the spell is executed passionately and nearly flawlessly. - The audience gasps at the sight, enraptured by the beauty of the display. - The judges score highly, rewarding your creativity and the spell's complex visual impact.

(9/10) - Creativity: A Phoenix is a bold choice, showcasing renewal and the cyclical nature of magic. (9/10) - Precision: The spell is cast with excellent accuracy, and the Phoenix's flight is captivating. (9/10) - Adaptability: The constant transformation of embers into tiny birds demonstrates exceptional adaptability. (9/10) - Grace: The motion and continuation of the spell are nothing short of elegant. (9/10) However, as the Phoenix vanishes, Sapphire feels a strange sensation, as if something within her has been sapped away. Meanwhile, Lily silently revels in the silent success of her spell, feeling a surge of newfound power and aged wisdom infusing her young mind and body. Lily responds with a spell of her own, producing an enchanting pattern of ice crystals that levitate around her, catching the dwindling light of Sapphire's Phoenix Fire and refracting it through their delicate structures. While not as potent or grand as Sapphire's spell, it earns her admiration for its delicate beauty and her surprising courage. As the round concludes, Sapphire prepares for the next, unaware of how the shifting magic will test her skills and prowess further. End of Round 1: Sapphire's Cumulative Score: 45/50 Lily's Cumulative Score: Judges are inclined to encourage the young upstart, giving her a more favorable score than her skills would suggest, yet she still trails behind the reigning champion.

Note that these slogans are fictitious and meant for entertainment purposes only. 1. Chevrolet – \\"Building a plastic fantastic future, one Caprice at a time.\\" Meaning: Refers to the heavy use of plastic in interiors and sometimes uninspiring design of some models like the Chevy Caprice which was known for its boxy shape. 2. Cadillac – \\"Because nothing says success like a trunk the size of a studio apartment.\\" Meaning: Cadillac models at the time, such as the Fleetwood, were known for their grandiose size and particularly large rear overhangs. 3. Pontiac – \\"We put the ‘Grand’ in 'Grand Am', and the 'Plastic' in 'Fantastic.'\\" Meaning: Pontiac tried to market their vehicles as sporty (hence \\"Grand\\") and had a noticeable amount of plastic body cladding, notably on the Grand Am. 4. Buick – \\"Buick: When your sofa wants to go for a drive.\\" Meaning: Buick vehicles were often considered very comfortable but with soft suspensions, giving the feeling of driving a couch. 5. GMC – \\"Professional Grade? More like 'Professionally Aged'.\\" Meaning: Even though GMC pitched \\"Professional Grade\\" vehicles, the designs were often similar to older platforms and shared much with Chevrolet Trucks. 6. Oldsmobile – \\"Not your father’s Oldsmobile, because even he didn’t want it.\\" Meaning: A play on an actual Oldsmobile slogan (\\"This is not your father's Oldsmobile\\"), hinting that their attempts to modernize and attract younger buyers weren't quite hitting the mark. 7. Saturn – \\"A different kind of car, a familiar kind of plastic.\\" Meaning: Saturn was marketed as GM’s \\"different\\" brand, but the heavy use of plastic, particularly in the body panels, was a common feature across many GM models. Remember that these slogans are intended as playful satire and do not represent actual General Motors marketing efforts, but they do point to widely held perceptions about GM vehicles at that time."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Plays On General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2004 And Their Meaning?","output":"Certainly! Let's create some satirical takes on what General Motors (GM) division slogans might have sounded like in 2004, focusing on the design trends and brand perceptions of that time. Remember, these are fictitious slogans meant for humor: 1. Chevrolet – \\"Chevrolet: An American Revolution – Same Monarchy.\\" Meaning: Refers to Chevrolet's actual tagline, \\"An American Revolution,\\" but satirizes the lack of significant change in design innovation during that era. 2. Cadillac – \\"Cadillac: We're the art and the science. Mostly the 'art' of rebadging.\\" Meaning: Playing on Cadillac's slogan \\"Art and Science,\\" this satirical slogan mocks the tendency for some higher-end brands to share platforms and components with less luxurious ones within the same parent company. 3. Pontiac – \\"Pontiac: Driving excitement – or at least that's what the plastic cladding suggests.\\" Meaning: Pontiac's image of \\"driving excitement\\" contrasts with the prevalent use of plastic body panels on vehicles like the Pontiac Aztek, which had a controversial design. 4. Buick – \\"Buick: Dream up your own parking space – you'll need the extra room.\\" Meaning: A jest on Buick's tradition of producing larger cars during a time when downsizing was a trend and parking spaces seemed to be shrinking. 5. GMC – \\"GMC: We are Professional Grade, with a degree in imitation.\\" Meaning: While GMC promoted their vehicles as \\"Professional Grade,\\" critics might argue they were not significantly different from their Chevrolet siblings, outside of some trim and badge distinctions. 6. Saturn – \\"Saturn: Like a rock. A plastic rock.\\" Meaning: This slogan modifies Chevrolet's old slogan \\"Like a Rock\\" to reflect Saturn's continued use of dent-resistant plastic body panels, albeit at the cost of a less conventional aesthetic and tactile feel. 7. Hummer – \\"Hummer: Because size matters in traffic too.\\" Meaning: Highlights the massive scale of Hummer vehicles, which were criticized for their poor fuel economy and impractical size for regular city driving. 8. Oldsmobile (phased out by 2004) – \\"Oldsmobile: Final rest for a once 'Rocket' brand.\\" Meaning: A nostalgic nod to Oldsmobile's \\"Rocket\\" age of innovation, commenting on the brand's demise and its once iconic status within the American automotive industry. Please note that these slogans are completely made-up for a playful satire and are not representative of the official marketing strategies of GM or its divisions. They are designed to humorously reflect some criticisms and observations of the era's automotive designs."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Plays On General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 2009 And Their Meaning?","output":"Sure! In 2009, General Motors faced significant challenges, including a government bailout and restructuring. Humorously reflecting on that period and the design choices in GM's lineup, I can offer you creative, satirical slogans for some of their divisions: 1. Chevrolet – \\"Chevy Runs Deep. Pockets? Not so much.\\" Meaning: Referring to GM's financial woes during the bailout, poking fun at the \\"Chevy Runs Deep\\" slogan while highlighting their tight budgets. 2. Cadillac – \\"Cadillac: Redefining luxury, one bailout at a time.\\" Meaning: Cadillac's attempt to uphold its luxury status despite the economic strains affecting innovation and investment during GM's financial crisis. 3. GMC – \\"GMC: Because 'rebadged Chevy' doesn't have quite the same ring to it.\\" Meaning: The tendency for GMC vehicles to be perceived as upmarket rebadges of Chevrolet models, emphasizing their similarity. 4. Buick – \\"Buick: It's not old, it's classic – just like our customer base.\\" Meaning: This plays on Buick's image at the time as a brand typically favored by an older demographic, despite efforts to attract a younger audience. 5. Pontiac – \\"Pontiac: We build excitement... but you might want to hurry.\\" Meaning: As the Pontiac brand was being phased out in 2009, this slogan humorously suggests the fleeting opportunity to experience the \\"excitement\\" Pontiac had claimed to offer. 6. Saturn – \\"Rethink American. Rethink staying in business.\\" Meaning: Referencing Saturn's \\"Rethink American\\" campaign with an ironic nod to the brand's discontinuation in 2009. 7. Hummer – \\"Hummer: Go green. Recycle. By that, we mean recycle the whole car.\\" Meaning: This satirical slogan teases the gas-guzzling reputation of Hummer vehicles in an era when \\"going green\\" was becoming more critical. 8. Chevrolet Volt – \\"Chevy Volt: Shocking the system, one charge at a time.\\" Meaning: While not a division, the Chevrolet Volt as a model represented revolutionary technology for GM with its electric powertrain, introduced as a saving grace during a rocky financial time. Remember, these slogans are entirely fictional, presented for entertainment, and serve as playful commentary on perceptions and challenges faced by General Motors around 2009. They are not actual marketing materials from GM."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Plays On General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design?","output":"Certainly! Below are satirical takes on General Motors division slogans that play on various stereotypes and perceptions of their design philosophies over the years: 1. Chevrolet – \\"Find New Roads – Because the One to Originality Is Under Construction.\\" Meaning: This pokes fun at Chevrolet's sometimes criticized lack of originality in design, suggesting that they're still working on finding a path to design innovation while using their real slogan \\"Find New Roads.\\" 2. Cadillac – \\"'Standard of the World'? More Like 'Standardized for the World.'\\" Meaning: Cadillac has long touted itself as a benchmark of luxury with the tagline \\"Standard of the World,\\" but this twist suggests they've globalized to the extent of losing some uniqueness. 3. GMC – \\"Like A Rock – But Now with More Chrome.\\" Meaning: Referencing Chevy's old slogan to imply GMC's vehicles are largely similar in toughness but with added flashy chrome to differentiate them slightly. 4. Buick – \\"Buick: When You Really Want Everyone to Think You've Retired.\\" Meaning: A playful jab at the stereotype that Buick is the brand of choice for older generations, despite their efforts to appeal to a broader, younger market. 5. Chevrolet Corvette – \\"Corvette: Turning Mid-Life Crises Into High-Speed Chases Since 1953.\\" Meaning: The Corvette is often associated with middle-aged men trying to reclaim their youth, hence the tongue-in-cheek reference to a \\"mid-life crisis.\\" 6. Chevrolet Silverado – \\"The Heartbeat of America – Now With More Cubic Inches.\\" Meaning: Playing off Chevy's vintage slogan and America's love affair with big powerful trucks, often featuring large displacement engines. 7. Cadillac Escalade – \\"Escalating Expectations, Expanding Waistlines.\\" Meaning: The Escalade is a very large SUV, and this spoof slogan satirizes its size and the brand's tendency to go bigger to meet luxury demands. 8. Chevrolet Camaro – \\"Camaro: Because Sometimes You Need to Compromise Between a Sedan and a Spaceship.\\" Meaning: A playful nudge at the Camaro's aggressive, almost futuristic styling that stands out from regular sedans but isn't quite out of this world. 9. GMC Hummer EV – \\"Quiet Like A Mouse, Sizable Like An Elephant.\\" Meaning: Reflects the new Hummer EV's silent electric operation, contrasting with its massive size and presence on the road. Please note again that these are fictional slogans intended for satirical and entertainment purposes only and are not affiliated with or representative of General Motors or its products."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical Plays On General Motors Division Slogans That Are Based On Their Design During 1994 And They Meaning?","output":"Certainly, let's travel back to 1994 and create some satirical GM division slogans that comment on the design philosophies and brand characteristics of the era: 1. Chevrolet – \\"Chevrolet: Like a Rock. And just about as aerodynamic.\\" Meaning: Referring both to Chevrolet's iconic slogan and the boxy, less aerodynamic designs common in their earlier truck models. 2. Cadillac – \\"Cadillac: Creating long cars for long driveways.\\" Meaning: Cadillacs in 1994 often featured extended rear ends, epitomizing luxury that required equally sizable parking spaces. 3. Pontiac – \\"Pontiac: We build excitement. And plenty of body cladding.\\" Meaning: Playing on Pontiac's tagline about excitement, while poking fun at the ubiquitous and sometimes overused plastic cladding on models like the Grand Am. 4. Buick – \\"Buick: Whisper-quiet comfort. So you can hear the turn signal... forever.\\" Meaning: Highlighting Buick's focus on comfort and a quiet ride, along with a humorous nod to the stereotype of Buick drivers often being elderly and forgetful about their turn signals. 5. GMC – \\"GMC: It's not just a truck; it's a two-ton passport to masculinity.\\" Meaning: A satirical representation of GMC's tough and rugged image, perhaps exaggerating the notion that driving a big truck correlates with masculinity. 6. Oldsmobile – \\"Oldsmobile: This is not your father's Oldsmobile, but it might be your grandfather's.\\" Meaning: Making light of the actual Oldsmobile campaign attempting to modernize the brand's image, but acknowledging its lingering reputation for appealing to an older demographic. 7. Chevrolet Corvette – \\"Corvette: Reminding your neighbors that 55 mph is just a suggestion.\\" Meaning: The Corvette has long been associated with speed and performance, and this quip humorously suggests that Corvette drivers are inclined to exceed speed limits. The slogans are entirely fictitious and designed to evoke a mixture of humor and nostalgia for General Motors' design choices during the mid-90s. They are not meant to be taken as legitimate advertising language or reflections of GM's branding strategy."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.","output":"For Topic 2.2 \\"Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy,\\" the curriculum would delve into the detailed relationship between potential energy and the distance between atoms in a molecule, also considering the nature of bond formation and strength as described by Coulomb's law.

The animation landscape of today is vastly different, with numerous studios producing content with higher production values and more variety in storytelling and visual quality."},{"instruction":"Can You Imagine Satirical American Animation Studio Slogans That Are Based On Their Quality During 1984 And Their Meaning?","output":"Sure, imagining satirical slogans for American animation studios in 1984 would require a playful look at the context of that time. Animation during the 1980s had specific trends and qualities, particularly in the United States. Keep in mind that the following are imaginative, humorous slogans and not actual slogans used by the studios. 1. **Hanna-Barbera Productions** - \\"Where recycled backgrounds meet the future of cost-saving animation!\\" - Meaning: Hanna-Barbera was known for reusing animation cells and backgrounds to save on production costs. 2. **Filmation** - \\"Quality is our #1... consideration for later.\\" - Meaning: Filmation sometimes favored quantity over quality, focusing on producing a high volume of content, often with limited animation techniques. 3. **Disney Animation Studios** - \\"Because every decade needs its 'Black Cauldron'.\\" - Meaning: At this time, Disney was experiencing a lull in its animation dominance, with some commercial disappointments like \\"The Black Cauldron\\" (1985). 4. **Warner Bros. Animation** - \\"For when you've run out of Saturday morning cereal, and nothing else is on.\\" - Meaning: Warner Bros. had moved away from their classic Looney Tunes era and were producing content primarily for TV, which was less critically acclaimed. 5. **Ralph Bakshi's Studio** - \\"Because what's animation without a little controversy?\\" - Meaning: Ralph Bakshi was known for his adult-oriented and often controversial animated films which were quite different from the standard family fare. 6. **Don Bluth Productions** - \\"Where escaping from 'The Land Before Time' means leaving other studios behind.\\" - Meaning: Don Bluth left Disney to create his own studio and produced some successful films such as \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" and later \\"The Land Before Time\\". 7. **Sunbow Entertainment** - \\"Transforming toy commercials into your favorite childhood memories!\\" - Meaning: Sunbow was known for producing animated series such as \\"Transformers\\" and \\"G.I. Joe\\", which were essentially vehicles for toymakers like Hasbro to promote their products. This playful spin on the state of the animation industry in 1984 highlights the limitations, challenges, and characteristics of each studio with a dash of humor."},{"instruction":"Enhance this GPT3.5 prompt to work consistently and ensure it does not mention the following / upcoming / next sections in the blog post. ~~~ Write the content for a single section according to the heading below: {{item}} Output nothing but the content for the single section.

If you are looking to make this function dynamic, such as taking the post's URL and title as parameters, you would have to modify the function accordingly."},{"instruction":"Make it so that it auto saves a draft","output":"To modify your function so that it automatically saves a draft on WordPress, you'll need to ensure that the URL used in the function corresponds to the WordPress draft saving functionality. However, the standard WordPress URL structure does not support direct draft creation via query parameters. You typically have to use the WordPress dashboard or an API call with proper authentication to auto-save a draft. Still, I can help you with a function that will open the WordPress post editor page, where you can manually save your post as a draft. Here's how you might set up such a function: \`\`\`javascript function postToWordpressDraft(postContent) { var selectionText = postContent || ''; var document = window.document; var location = document.location; var wordpressUrl = 'https://wordpress.com/post/paidpursuit.wordpress.com'; var url = wordpressUrl + \\"?text=\\" + encodeURIComponent(selectionText); var popup = function() { window.open(url, \\"t\\", \\"toolbar=0,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,status=1,width=660,height=570\\"); }; // Firefox requires a slight delay if (/Firefox/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { setTimeout(popup, 0); } else { popup(); } } // To use the function with a selected string as post content. postToWordpressDraft('Your selected string here.'); \`\`\` This code will open the WordPress new post page with the content you provided in the \`postContent\` variable filled out in the editor. You would then have to manually click on \\"Save Draft\\" in the WordPress post editor. As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, directly saving a draft through a URL parameter is not possible without using the WordPress REST API or another backend method that involves authentication to interact with your WordPress site programmatically. For automated draft saving, you would need to explore the WordPress REST API and write a function that makes authenticated POST requests to create a draft. This process typically involves Oauth or cookie authentication and is considerably more complex than opening a URL in a new window."},{"instruction":"Create a version using Wordpress.com's REST API","output":"Creating a WordPress draft post using the WordPress.com REST API requires authentication and client-side requests cannot be made due to the CORS policy. However, for illustration purposes, here is how a function to make an API request to create a new draft post might look like. Remember, in practice, this request needs to be made from a server-side application or a platform that is CORS-compliant with proper authentication. You'll need a WordPress.com OAuth token to use the API for authentication. Below is a conceptual example that you shouldn't use as-is for security and functionality purposes. \`\`\`javascript function saveDraftToWordpress(postContent, oauthToken) { // Replace with your actual site ID or domain var siteId = 'your-site-id-or-domain.com'; var apiEndpoint = \`https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/{siteId}/posts/new\`; // Setup the API request payload var postData = { title: \\"Draft Title\\", // Put your desired post title here content: postContent, status: 'draft' // This ensures the post is saved as a draft }; // Prepare the XMLHttpRequest var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('POST', apiEndpoint, true); xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + oauthToken); xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState === 4) { // Done if (xhr.status === 201) { // Created console.log('Draft saved:', JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)); } else { console.error('Error saving draft:', xhr.responseText); } } }; // Send the API request xhr.send(JSON.stringify(postData)); } // To use the function, you must pass in the desired post content and a valid OAuth token. saveDraftToWordpress('Your post content here', 'YourOAuthToken'); \`\`\` When using the WordPress API: 1. You need to replace \`your-site-id-or-domain.com\` with the actual domain name or site ID of your WordPress blog. 2. Use the actual title for the draft post you want to save. 3. Replace \`'YourOAuthToken'\` with your actual OAuth token. Obtaining this token involves registering an application with WordPress.com, directing the user to a login screen, and receiving the token after they have authenticated. Due to the sensitive nature of OAuth tokens which grant access to your WordPress account, you should handle them securely and never expose them in client-side code (like JavaScript running in the browser). Typically, operations like this should be executed server-side, making sure all credentials are kept secure. Remember that you will need to abide by WordPress.com's API documentation and guidelines, and also handle authorization properly for your use case."},{"instruction":"How to get OAuth token","output":"To obtain an OAuth token from WordPress.com, you need to follow these steps: 1. **Register Your Application:** Visit the [WordPress.com Developer Resources](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/) and select 'Create New Application'. Fill out the form with your application details. The most critical step here is providing a correct \\"Redirect URL\\" that your application will listen on to receive the OAuth token. 2. **Get Authorization Code:** You will have to direct the user to the authorization URL where they will be prompted to log into WordPress.com and authorize your application to access their account. The URL typically looks like this: \`\`\` https://public-api.wordpress.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri&response_type=code \`\`\` Replace \`your_client_id\` with the client ID you received when registering your application and \`your_redirect_uri\` with the Redirect URL that you specified. 3. **Receive Authorization Code:** After the user approves the authorization request, WordPress.com will redirect them back to your 'Redirect URL' with a \`code\` parameter attached to the URL. This is the authorization code; it is short-lived and can be exchanged for an access token. 4. **Exchange Authorization Code for an Access Token:** Your server should make a POST request to the WordPress.com API to exchange the authorization code for an access token. The POST request will look something like this: \`\`\` POST https://public-api.wordpress.com/oauth2/token client_id=your_client_id &redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri &client_secret=your_client_secret &code=authorization_code_received &grant_type=authorization_code \`\`\` The response will contain the \`access_token\` which is the bearer token that you'll use to make authenticated API calls. **Important Notes:** - Keep your \`client_secret\` confidential. If you are working in a client-side application, you should not be exposing your \`client_secret\`. The access token exchange should be done in a backend environment that the client cannot access. - You need an HTTPS-enabled redirect URI (not HTTP) unless it's localhost, due to the OAuth2 security requirements. - WordPress may have additional scopes that you can specify when authorizing the user, which will give you different levels of access to the user’s account. You'll need to request the appropriate scopes for your application to work. Be sure to read the official [WordPress.com OAuth2 Authentication documentation](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/) thoroughly for detailed guidelines, as it will provide code samples, describe the necessary scopes, and explain the OAuth flow step by step."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function B(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",j,[(t(!0),i(v,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
