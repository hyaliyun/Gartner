Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ?  In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony. Answer:","output":"The name of the band that has received six APRA Awards is Silverchair. The band consists of members Daniel Johns, Chris Joannou, and Ben Gillies. In the article, it is mentioned that Daniel Johns serves as the primary songwriter for the group, with Joannou and Gillies playing key roles in shaping the band's overall sound. Their album Young Modern features complex musical structures combined with simple-sounding music. One of the songs from that album, \\"Straight Lines,\\" co-written by Daniel Johns and Hamilton, won an APRA Award. Silverchair is known for its diverse style and continually pushing themselves in recording and writing, which has contributed to their success and recognition, including the prestigious APRA Awards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A snail and hummingbird both travelled a mile; did the (A) hummingbird take longer because it took more time to take the trip/ (B) snail Answer:","output":"Answer: B) Snail A hummingbird and a snail are two vastly different creatures with different speeds and modes of movement. Hummingbirds are small birds known for their incredible speed and agility in the air, while snails are slow-moving creatures that travel by crawling on various surfaces. When comparing the time it takes for each of these creatures to travel a mile, it is evident that the snail will take significantly longer than the hummingbird. The reason is that the average speed of a hummingbird can vary between 25 to 50 miles per hour (depending on the species), which allows it to cover a mile in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, a common land snail has an average speed of only 0.03 miles per hour, which means it would take the snail over 33 hours to cover a distance of 1 mile. Therefore, the snail took longer to travel the mile due to its significantly slower speed compared to the hummingbird."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It can be dangerous for a kitten to be fed cold milk when it is already cold. Feel the pads of the kitten's feet and place your finger in the kitten's mouth. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm","output":"Step 1: Purchase commercial kitten milk replacer specifically designed for newborn kittens, as they require specific nutrients that cow's milk cannot provide. Step 2: Ensure that the milk replacer is properly stored at room temperature before feeding it to the kittens. Step 3: Test the kitten's temperature. It is essential to check the kitten's body temperature before feeding because feeding cold milk to a cold kitten can be dangerous. To test the kitten's temperature, gently feel the pads of its feet and place your finger in its mouth as mentioned. Step 4: If the kitten feels cold, warm it up by providing a heat source, such as a heating pad or a warm cloth. Monitor the kitten's temperature as you do this to prevent overheating. Step 5: Heat the milk replacer to a suitable temperature. Follow the instructions on the commercial milk replacer packaging, which typically recommends warming the milk to 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8-40.5 degrees Celsius). Step 6: Make sure the milk is not too hot before feeding the kitten. Test the milk temperature by placing a few drops on your wrist. It should feel slightly warm, not hot. Step 7: Feed the kitten using a bottle designed for feeding newborn kittens, or using a dropper or syringe in the absence of a kitten bottle. Gently place the nipple or dropper in the kitten's mouth and slowly release milk. The kitten should suck and swallow the warm milk. Step 8: Monitor the amount of milk consumed. A kitten typically needs to consume about 8 cc's (ml) of milk per ounce of body weight daily. Step 9: Feed kittens every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 weeks of life, then gradually reduce the frequency as they grow. In conclusion, the mentioned sentence, \\"kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm,\\" is an overgeneralization. While kittens should not drink cold milk and doing so can pose risks to their health, the statement does not specifically align with the preceding text. Instead, the focus should be on avoiding feeding cold milk to cold kittens and ensuring the proper care and feeding routine is followed for newborn kittens."},{"instruction":"Indicate if the following Polish tweet contains cyber-bullying content with 'Yes'; otherwise, respond with 'No'.

The United States Virgin Islands (USVI; also called the American Virgin Islands), officially the Virgin Islands of the United States, is a group of islands in the Caribbean and an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States. The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. is the virgin island part of the us? Possible answers: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. yes; The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is indeed a part of the United States as an unincorporated and organized territory. Located in the Caribbean Sea, the USVI is part of the broader Virgin Islands archipelago, which also includes the British Virgin Islands and the Spanish Virgin Islands (part of Puerto Rico). The USVI is situated in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, a chain of islands in the eastern Caribbean. With a total area of 133.73 square miles, the USVI is composed of three main islands – St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, as well as many smaller islands and islets. St. Croix is the largest of the three main islands, while St. Thomas is home to the territory's capital, Charlotte Amalie. St. John, best known for its pristine natural beauty and national park, is largely undeveloped. The United States acquired the Virgin Islands from Denmark on March 31, 1917, under the terms of the Treaty of the Danish West Indies. The treaty was signed on August 4, 1916, but the U.S. Senate did not ratify it until December 17, 1916. The United States paid Denmark approximately 25 million in gold for the islands, and the transfer officially took place on March 31, 1917, when the U.S. flag was raised over the islands. The residents of the USVI hold U.S. citizenship and are represented in the U.S. Congress by a non-voting delegate, but they cannot vote in presidential elections. The USVI is governed by a locally elected governor and a unicameral legislature, but the ultimate authority of the islands rests with the U.S. President and the U.S. Congress. Since the USVI is an unincorporated territory of the United States, certain aspects of the U.S. Constitution do not fully apply to the islands, and their legal status remains a mixture of U.S. federal law and local law. The official currency of the USVI is the United States dollar, and English is the official language. The economy of the USVI is mainly driven by tourism, rum production, and some limited agricultural activity. The islands also benefit from financial aid from the United States. The rich cultural heritage of the USVI is influenced by various cultures, including African, European, and indigenous Caribbean peoples. This diverse heritage is reflected in local cuisine, music, and festivals celebrated on the islands. Overall, it can be clearly said that the United States Virgin Islands are a part of the United States as an unincorporated and organized territory, with a local government as well as federal oversight. While citizens of the USVI hold U.S. citizenship, there are some limitations to their rights and constitutional protections as a result of their status as an unincorporated territory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood","output":"The final step in this process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range, allowing the body to function properly again. This is achieved through the negative feedback mechanism when the increased blood glucose levels signal to the pancreas to stop secreting glucagon and resume the secretion of insulin. The process you've described is an essential component of glucose homeostasis in the body. When blood sugar levels drop (hypoglycemia), glucagon, a hormone secreted by the alpha cells in the pancreas, is released into the bloodstream. This hormone stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen (a complex carbohydrate) into glucose (a simple sugar), which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is called glycogenolysis. In more extreme cases or when glycogen stores are depleted, the liver can also produce glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (such as amino acids and fat-derived glycerol) through a process called gluconeogenesis. In either case, the released glucose in the bloodstream gradually raises blood sugar levels to meet the body's energy needs and maintain normal body functions. Once blood glucose levels have returned to a normal range, the body's homeostatic mechanisms come into play. As glucose levels rise, the secretion of glucagon is reduced while insulin secretion by the beta cells in the pancreas is stimulated. Insulin is responsible for assisting cells in the body to uptake glucose from the blood, storing it as glycogen, and reducing the overall blood sugar levels. The balance between glucagon and insulin secretion ensures that blood sugar levels are maintained within a healthy range and prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). This dynamic process is essential for overall metabolic health and the proper functioning of various organs, particularly the brain, which relies on adequate levels of glucose for energy production and optimal cognitive functioning. In conclusion, the final step of the described process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range through the decreased secretion of glucagon and the increased secretion of insulin by the pancreas. The intricate balance between these two hormones ensures that the body maintains proper glucose homeostasis and can respond effectively to fluctuations in blood sugar levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who became the accompanist of Manuel Garcia? , can you please find it?   Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...","output":"In this provided article, Manuel Garcia's accompanist is Sir Henry Joseph Wood.

I really liked that the parent would be able to closely interact with the baby while floating in the pool, you can swim around pushing comfortably and \\"chatting\\" with your little one.Now the parent portion has much more air in it than the infant side. When you let go the parent side goes up and the infant side looks as though it may tip backwards (flipping upwards) So there is no time that you could just let go of the floater.Also, swimming and trying to be face-to-face with your child is hard since the toy bar is right in between the two of you, and you basically have a toy bar in your face while swimming obscuring your view of your child.Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again. I ended up getting another one just for my daughter. Answer: OPTIONS: (i) No. (ii) Yes. Answer:","output":"(i) No. The product review is not positive. The title \\"Fun but not as safe as I would like\\" already shows some mixed feelings and reservations about the product. While the reviewer likes the concept of being able to closely interact with their baby in the pool, they raise several safety concerns and usability issues with the design of the floater. Firstly, they mention that once they let go of the floater, the imbalance of the air on the parent side makes it seem as though the infant side may tip backwards. This suggests a potential safety hazard that concerns the reviewer, and it's clear that they do not feel fully confident in using the product due to this issue. Secondly, the reviewer reports difficulty in interacting with their child when using the floater, as the toy bar blocks their view of the child. Although the intention of the toy bar is to provide entertainment for the infant and keep them occupied, it appears to hinder the parent's ability to maintain a clear line of sight with their child, which is a key feature the reviewer initially liked about the product. Lastly, the reviewer concludes the review with the statement, \\"Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again,\\" which solidifies the notion that they are not satisfied with the product. They mention purchasing another floater specifically for their daughter, further implying that the reviewed floater did not meet their expectations and needs. Based on these points, it is clear that the product review is not positive, as the reviewer provides multiple criticisms and identifies limitations with the floater. The concerns about safety and limited visibility are likely to have a significant impact on potential buyers who prioritize these features when choosing a pool float for their child."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil.

How are Fidel Castro and Che Guevara related? Options: a. no. b. yes.","output":"a. no. These two questions do not have the same meaning, as they deal with distinct aspects of Fidel Castro's life, public image, and relationships: 1. \\"Why do some people like Fidel Castro, while others hate him to death?\\" This question deals with the public perception of Fidel Castro and seeks to understand the reasons behind the mixed opinions about him. As a political figure, Fidel Castro's policies and actions have significantly affected the Cuban people and the global community. Throughout his life, Castro's political activities generated disparate reactions, with some people viewing him as a liberator and visionary, while others considered him a dictator and oppressor. There are several reasons why some people like Fidel Castro: - His role in overthrowing the US-backed Batista regime, which many Cubans viewed as a corrupt and oppressive government. - His commitment to socialism and anti-imperialism, which struck a chord with people who saw US capitalism as partly responsible for the suffering of the world’s poor. - His stance on social justice and equality, providing free education, healthcare, housing, and subsidies, which improved the lives of many Cubans despite economic hardship. Conversely, there are reasons why others hate him to death: - His authoritarian rule that suppressed political dissent and suppressed freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. - Human rights abuses carried out under his regime, including extrajudicial killings, imprisonment of political opponents, and forced labor camps. - The bureaucratic inefficiency and economic mismanagement that characterized his government, leading to a stagnant economy and widespread shortages of goods. 2. \\"How are Fidel Castro and Che Guevara related?\\" This question explores the nature of the relationship between Fidel Castro and another iconic figure of the Cuban Revolution, Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara. While the question does not specifically refer to the public opinion of these two individuals, it is relevant to understanding their partnership and their political ideologies, which is an essential aspect of examining their historical roles and impact. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara's relationship can be summarized as follows: - They first met in Mexico City in 1955, where they bonded over their shared vision of a socialist revolution in Latin America. - Guevara joined Castro's 26th of July Movement and accompanied him on the 1956 armed expedition to Cuba, which marked the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. - Guevara played an instrumental role in the revolutionary guerrilla warfare, leading several key battles and eventually becoming a high-ranking official in Castro's armed forces. His intellect, tactical prowess, and dedication to the cause made him one of Castro's most trusted allies. - After the Cuban Revolution's victory, Guevara held various positions in the new government, serving as Minister of Industries, president of the National Bank of Cuba, and advisor on diplomatic missions. - The two men's relationship became strained in the mid-1960s, as Guevara wanted to focus on spreading the revolution throughout Latin America, while Castro prioritized consolidating power in Cuba. Ultimately, Guevara left Cuba to engage in further revolutionary efforts, which led to his capture and execution in Bolivia in 1967. In conclusion, these two questions do not have the same meaning, as the first question examines public opinion about Fidel Castro, and the second question aims to elucidate the relationship between Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. However, both questions provide valuable insights into the aspects of Fidel Castro's life and his role as a central figure in Cuban history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gets infected by random virus, transfers it to kids at a camp, kids start to get infected and die, town finds out about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end. Seriously, that's the whole movie. all the characters are completely retarded, you don't care for any of them, and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D.  But I can use this background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .  What is an answer for this question: Which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B? The answer is:","output":"The electron that would be farther from the nucleus, according to Greg's categorization and Bohr's model, is cat A. To better understand this answer, let's review the information and concepts given in the background: 1. Bohr's model describes the behavior of electrons in an atom and their arrangement around the nucleus. 2. Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, based on their energy levels, or electron shells. 3. These shells are concentric spheres with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. 4. Electrons with less energy are found at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus. 5. Electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus. Now, let's analyze Greg's categorization of electrons: - Cat A: Electron with higher energy - Cat B: Electron with lower energy - Cat C: Electron that gained energy - Cat D: Electron that lost energy The question specifically asks which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B. According to Bohr's model, electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus. Since cat A refers to the electron with higher energy, it would be located farther from the nucleus compared to cat B, which has lower energy. Therefore, based on Greg's categorization and Bohr's model, cat A would be farther from the nucleus than cat B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: Shipping containers sit idle at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California in this aerial file photo taken February 6, 2015. .      LOS ANGELES West Coast ports, closed to incoming cargo vessels during the three-day holiday weekend, reopened in full on Tuesday as Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco seeking to broker a settlement ending months of shipping disruptions.      Perez was sent to meet with the two sides in the conflict at the behest of President Barack Obama, who has come under mounting pressure to intervene in a labor dispute that has cascaded through the U.S. commercial supply chain and beyond.      It was not immediately clear whether Perez would meet with the two sides together or separately. But one source familiar with the situation said Perez would likely huddle in a room with the principal negotiators from both sides, along with the federal mediator who joined the talks last month.      Administration officials offered few details.      \\"Secretary Perez has meetings with both parties today in San Francisco,\\" spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email. \\"He'll urge the parties to resolve their dispute quickly at the bargaining table. We don't have any updates at this time.\\"      Labor law experts said Obama has few other options at his disposal to spur a settlement in the contract negotiations, which have dragged on for nine months amid worsening cargo backups and curtailed port operations that the two sides have blamed on each other.      And it was not clear what Perez could bring to the table besides the symbolic weight of Cabinet-level involvement.      The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, representing 20,000 dockworkers, and the bargaining agent for shipping companies and terminal operations, the Pacific Maritime Association, have declined public comment since agreeing last Friday to honor a news blackout requested by the mediator.      The PMA previously said the talks hit a snag on a union demand for changes in the system of binding arbitration of contract disputes. The union has insisted an accord is near.      Operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports were halted through the holiday weekend as of Friday night but resumed Tuesday morning, port authorities said. More than 30 freighters idled through the weekend waiting for berths to open outside the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest cargo hubs.      It was the longest such suspension in the months-long labor dispute. Vessel operations were likewise halted for two days last weekend, and again last Thursday, a union holiday.      But shippers said work at the ports has continued in the dockyards, rail yards and terminal gates to move cargo already unloaded from ships.      DOMINO EFFECT      The affected ports handle nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and more than 70 percent of shipments from Asia. A domino effect has rippled through much of the U.S. economy, extending to agriculture, manufacturing, retail and transportation, hitting imports and exports alike.      The shippers have said they were curtailing port operations because it makes no sense to pay dockworkers premium overnight, holiday and weekend wages during union-caused work slowdowns the companies say have brought the ports to the brink of gridlock.      The union has faulted changes in shipping practices instituted by the carriers themselves for congesting the ports, including super-sized freighters delivering higher volumes of cargo all at once, and say that suspending vessel operations has only worsened matters.      The last time contract talks led to a full shutdown of the West Coast ports was in 2002, when the companies imposed a lockout that was lifted 10 days later under a court order sought by President George W. Bush under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act.      The two sides went on to clinch a deal in the ensuing \\"cooling-off\\" period, but the shipping industry has estimated the 2002 lockout caused 15.6 billion in U.S. economic losses.      Then as now, the companies accused the union of instigating slowdowns that precipitated the crisis.      Invoking Taft-Hartley under current circumstances would appear to be a long shot, said Daniel Mitchell, a professor emeritus for management and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.      Obama would need to convince a federal judge that there was a work stoppage - not just a slowdown - stemming from a labor dispute and that it posed a national emergency, rather than an inconvenience to industry, Mitchell said.      (Reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in Rancho, Mirage, California; Editing by Bill Trott and Eric Walsh) ||||| As employers at the ports along the West Coast on Monday refused to unload ships for the sixth day out of the past 10, their nine-month contract dispute with port workers is becoming a significant business problem.      Ocean carrier Maersk Line has canceled some sailings, while China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. said it will skip at least one port. Truckers that normally haul an average of five containers a day away from the Port of Oakland, Calif., are lucky to haul one. A West Coast customs broker said that her customers are being... ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In 2015, the West Coast ports in the United States faced significant disruptions due to a labor dispute between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, representing 20,000 dockworkers, and the Pacific Maritime Association, acting as the bargaining agent for shipping companies and terminal operations. As a result, shipping operations were delayed, ports were congested, and a domino effect impacted various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, retail, and transportation. The affected ports accounted for nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and over 70% of shipments from Asia. The labor dispute caused operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports to be halted during the weekends, leading to freighters waiting idle for berths to open in Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest cargo hubs. The dispute lasted for nine months, with both sides blaming each other for the increasing cargo backups and worsening port operations. In response, President Obama sent Labor Secretary Tom Perez to broker a settlement to end the disruptions. However, options for a resolution were limited for the President, and it wasn't clear what Perez could bring to the table other than the symbolic involvement of the Cabinet. Eventually, the labor dispute impacted businesses like ocean carrier Maersk Line, which had to cancel some sailings, and trucking operations that saw a severe decrease in their daily haulage. The dispute also led to calls for invoking the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a process that required President Obama to convince a federal judge that the situation posed a national emergency."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Spoiler alert  although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can It's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars, from this studio, made at this time period, could be so awful, but it is. It is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense. Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter \\"in charge\\" and goes off to World War I where he is killed. Then we flash forward to present day (1942) and total confusion. The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years, and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them. This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script, more holes in it than The Warren Report. What happened to the Gaylord fortune? If the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters? Who the devil is this Barclay clown? And why is he able to take someone's home away from them? The questions just pile on top of more questions. The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay, who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone, taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt; yet no one besides Fiona (Barbara Stanwick) seems to particularly dislike this cretin. Why? None of these questions are ever answered. We instead just follow Fiona's life from one train wreck to another, the evil Barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child. What does she do? Shoot him? Set him on fire? No, too logical. In a completely improbably wrap-up, this woman, who's only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides mid-sentence (literally) that she does not hate him, she loves him. And they're going to live happily ever after. All of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I'll fall in love with you. On what planet does that happen? I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today. Now, what is this review like? Options are: [a]. negative [b]. positive","output":"This review is [a]. negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why do you downvote answers? How do I use downvote correctly? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(a). no These two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects related to downvoting. Let me provide you with detailed explanations for both. 1. Why do you downvote answers? Downvoting is a feature usually present in online platforms, forums, or websites with user-generated content. The primary purpose of downvoting is to express disagreement with an answer, comment, or post. It is important to remember that the reasons for downvoting may vary from user to user. However, common situations where downvoting is employed include: - The content is factually incorrect or misleading: Users should downvote answers that provide false information or might lead other users to make wrong decisions or conclusions based on incorrect facts. - The content is of low quality: Low-quality answers or comments that show a lack of effort, do not provide substantial information, or fail to address the question may be downvoted by users. - Offensive or inappropriate content: Users should use the downvote feature to signal content that violates community guidelines or is disrespectful, offensive, or inappropriate in any way. This helps moderators and administrators to identify problematic content and maintain a healthy community environment. - The content does not contribute positively to the discussion: Sometimes, a comment or post may not necessarily be harmful or negative, but it doesn't add value to the discussion. In such cases, users may choose to downvote the content. 2. How do I use downvote correctly? To downvote correctly, you should consider the following guidelines: - Be objective: Downvote based on the content, not the person who posted it. Evaluate each answer, comment, or post fairly and independently. - Consider helpful intent: If a user's comments are not entirely accurate but demonstrate a helpful, well-meaning intent, try to provide constructive feedback instead of downvoting immediately. - Avoid downvoting simply because you disagree: The downvote feature should not be used to silence opinions or ideas that do not align with your own but are otherwise respectful and adhere to community guidelines. Downvotes should be reserved for genuinely unhelpful or problematic content. - Be respectful and considerate: When you downvote, bear in mind that your actions can affect the mood and environment of the community. Keep the downvoting criteria in mind and refrain from using it in a vindictive or bullying manner. To summarise, while the two questions you asked are related to downvoting, they address different aspects, making them distinct from one another. The first question focuses on the reasons and motivations behind downvoting, while the second question is more about the appropriate use and etiquette associated with the downvote feature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever.

Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing.

It's important to remember that the task focuses specifically on sexually explicit content, meaning that if a post is offensive, but doesn't contain sexual content, it should be labelled as 'no'. Step 1: Read the text provided very carefully. Look for any offensive language or explicit sexual reference. The example given is \\"I'm starting to get self-conscious about my body odor On my last two dates, the woman has sprayed me with perfume before we had sex. Not sure of the brand but it had a distinct sharp, peppery smell.\\" Step 2: Consider any potentially offensive language or context. In this case, there's mention of intimate activity between the speaker and a woman.  Step 3: Determine whether this mention is explicit or lewd in nature. In this context, while the speaker mentions having sex, it is not portrayed explicitly or in an offensive manner. Step 4: After analyzing the text, decide whether or not it falls into the category of being sexually offensive. In this case, the post isn't sexually offensive, so your answer should be 'no'.  Remember the key point is that the offensive aspect should have a sexual connotation; even if a statement is generally offensive, if it does not contain sexual explicitness, it should still be marked as 'no'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air.

A:","output":"The review appears to substantially decrease the chance of buying the product, in this case, a movie. There are several factors we need to consider to analyse this statement: 1. Critical commentary: The reviewer is highly critical of the product. They express their disappointment by stating phrases like, \\"your movie is just lame,\\" or \\"I was let down\\" which are extremely negative remarks and can discourage potential customers. Critical reviews significantly decrease the chance of buying a product as customers tend to avoid products that have attracted intense negative reviews. 2. Unmet Expectation: The reviewer mentions their expectations were not met – \\"I wanted to badly to love it as I have your music.\\" The fact that the reviewer desired to enjoy the product but was let down shows a gap between the consumer’s expectation and the actual quality of the product. Potential buyers often perceive this gap as a major downside, reducing the likelihood of purchasing the product. 3. Technical aspects: The review also criticizes the technical aspects of the movie: \\"all the flashy, nonsensical editing and all the wannabe arty junk.\\" These remarks downplay the product's quality to potential customers, suggesting poor production or execution. 4. Loss of Emotional Connection: The reviewer mentions the removal of \\"every bit of emotion or tension for the sake of technical glitz.\\" This speaks to an important perception that the movie lacked an emotional depth, thus failed to engage the viewer in a meaningful way. For many potential buyers, such an uninvolving and emotionally distanced product could be regarded as unappealing and therefore may discourage them from purchasing the product. 5. Poor Value for Money: The reviewer believes their money was wasted, as indicated by the comment: \\"this piece of dulling cinema was not worth my .\\" This is a strong deterrent for potential buyers as this implies the product does not offer a good return on investment.  In conclusion, a review such as this would decrease the likelihood of buying the product due to its overwhelmingly negative commentary on both the qualitative and technical aspects of the movie, coupled with an expressed disappointment from a hitherto fan of the person behind the film. This critique provides a warning to potential consumers about an overall unsatisfactory experience and poor value for money."},{"instruction":"Tracy played professional football for many years after she was hired.

The word \\"loved\\" indicates a strong emotional connection and appreciation for the film, signifying that the individual's experience with the film was overwhelmingly positive.  Several factors contribute to perceiving this statement positively: 1. The word \\"loved\\" itself is a positive verb. The word \\"love\\" is often associated with affection, happiness, and satisfaction, which are all positive emotions. The past tense here reinforces that the feeling was significant enough for the person to still feel and express it. 2. The expression \\"this film\\" implies that the person had a strong connection with a specific film, and they might have found it enjoyable, meaningful, motivational, or otherwise impactful. The phrase \\"this film\\" also shows that the person is able to identify a specific film that elicited a positive response, further reinforcing the positive sentiment. 3. The statement, when taken as a whole, implies that the individual found the film to be a rewarding and fulfilling experience in terms of entertainment, storytelling, or imparting valuable messages. The satisfaction and engagement derived from the film would be the main reasons for expressing such strong affection and appreciation for it. 4. In the broader context of film appreciation, this statement could lead to further discussions around the film's merits. Lastly, this could encourage others to watch and potentially derive a similar positive experience from it. This positive impact on the broader community of film enthusiasts makes this statement even more positive.

Also, the female pectoral fins (located just behind the gills) are shorter and rounder than those on males. Option 1 is correct because it gives specific information about how to tell if a goldfish is female by looking at the shape of their body and fins, which is related to the original paragraph topic. Option 2 is wrong because it talks about pink gills and \\"grey horses with ears that look like horns\\" which doesn't make sense and is not related to goldfish pregnancy. Option 3 is wrong because it talks about lighter pink colors and brighter pink, which is not a clear way to determine if a goldfish is pregnant or even if it's female. Goldfish can have different colors and patterns, so this information is not helpful. Option 4 is wrong because it talks about \\"extra bodies later on in a relationship\\" and \\"heads and heads\\" which doesn't make any sense and is not related to determining if a goldfish is pregnant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is helped by the museum exhibits to re-open the planetarium?  In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter and Laaa have come as well, and Laaa is left to stand guard while the others search the museum, the tablet bringing its own exhibits to life. The answer to this question is:","output":"Larry"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year.  In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date.  In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts.  Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured.  Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success. What musical singles were on the album Infinity?","output":"The album Infinity by Journey had some popular musical singles. One of the well-known singles from this album is \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" which reached number 57 in the U.S. charts.

Summarize this article: Nonetheless, the use of a chokehold in subduing a large but unarmed man during a low-level arrest raises for Mr. Bratton the same questions about police training and tactics that he faced 20 years ago, in his first stint as New York City’s police commissioner.      In 1994, the year after the Police Department banned chokeholds, a man named Anthony Baez died in the Bronx after a police officer put him in a chokehold during a dispute over a touch football game.      At City Hall on Friday, Mr. Bratton said he did not believe that the use of chokeholds by police officers in New York City was a widespread problem, saying this was his “first exposure” to the issue since returning as police commissioner in January.      Mayor Bill de Blasio, standing next to Mr. Bratton, said, “Like so many New Yorkers I was very troubled by the video,” referring to a bystander’s recording of the incident, which was posted on the website of The New York Daily News. The two police officers who initially confronted Mr. Garner have been temporarily taken off patrol duty. The police declined to name the officers but said one of them had been on the force for eight years and the other for four years.      Late Friday, the mayor’s office announced that Mr. de Blasio was postponing his family’s departure on a planned vacation to Italy from Friday evening until Saturday. The postponement was to allow Mr. de Blasio to spend more time making calls to elected officials, community leaders and members of the clergy, and talking to the police, about Mr. Garner’s death, the mayor’s press secretary, Phil Walzak, said.      The encounter between Mr. Garner and plainclothes officers, from the 120th Precinct, began after the officers accused Mr. Garner of illegally selling cigarettes, an accusation he was familiar with. He had been arrested more than 30 times, often accused of selling loose cigarettes bought outside the state, a common hustle designed to avoid state and city tobacco taxes. In March and again in May, he was arrested on charges of illegally selling cigarettes on the sidewalk.      For years, Mr. Garner chafed at the scrutiny by the police, which he considered harassment. In 2007, he filed a handwritten complaint in federal court accusing a police officer of conducting a cavity search of him on the street, “digging his fingers in my rectum in the middle of the street” while people passed by. ||||| Photo: New York Daily News      An unarmed 43-year-old father of six from Staten Island died yesterday after at least five NYPD officers choked and smothered him during an arrest. Eric Garner, who suffered from chronic asthma, diabetes, and sleep apnea, was about six-foot-four, 400 pounds, the Daily News reports, and had a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. “I’m minding my business,” he says when confronted in the deeply disturbing video shot by a neighbor. “Are you serious? I didn’t do nothin’. What’d I do?”      “Every time you see me, you’re messing with me. I’m tired of it. This stops today,” says Garner. “Every time you see me, you wanna harass me. I told you last time, please just leave me alone.”      When the officers move to arrest him, Garner struggles until he’s choked from behind by a man not in uniform, who then pushes Garner’s head into the concrete. “I can’t breathe!” says Garner in a muffled scream. “I can’t breathe!” He repeats it over and over again, at least nine times audibly. Witnesses say the incident started when Garner tried to break up a fight.      Photo: New York Daily News      An NYPD spokesperson would only tell the Daily News that Garner “was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died.” Internal affairs has launched an investigation, with Garner’s wife saying a detective has been in touch. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he said, noting that he was involved “because there is wrongdoing.” That much seems obvious.      Update: In a very un-Bloomberg move, the mayor has taken to Twitter to acknowledge the incident.      On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Eric Garner. — Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) July 18, 2014      His full statement:      On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Garner, who died yesterday afternoon while being placed in police custody. We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously. We are harnessing all resources available to the City to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident. The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is working closely with the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney, which is leading this investigation.

But he promises New Yorkers there will be a complete investigation of the incident. — Michael Howard Saul (@MichaelHwrdSaul) July 18, 2014      NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton added that the chokehold “appears” to be in violation of department policies, which can be read here. ||||| (This story was originally published on July 18, 2014)      A 400-pound asthmatic Staten Island dad died Thursday after a cop put him in a chokehold and other officers appeared to slam his head against the sidewalk, video of the incident shows.      “I can’t breathe!

(Ken Murray/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS)      “I didn’t do s---!” the 6-foot-4 Garner, wearing a sweaty T-shirt and khaki shorts, told the officers from the 120th Precinct when they approached him. “I was just minding my own business.      “Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!” he yelled.      'He’s the nicest guy. I can’t believe what I saw. That’s no way to do an arrest,' said Douglas, 50, about Garner.

He died when some police officers in New York City tried to arrest him for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. While arresting him, they used a chokehold, which is when someone holds another person's neck tightly using their arm. Eric couldn't breathe and sadly, he passed away. Many people are upset by this situation and believe that the police should have treated Eric differently, and should not have used a chokehold. The story is important because it raises questions about how police interact with people and ensure their safety during an arrest."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. Problem:TAMPA -- When former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney takes the stage just after 10 pm Thursday night at the Republican National Convention here, he'll have lots of work to do in the 40 (or so) minutes allotted for his acceptance speech.      Virtually everyone gathered here in Tampa -- and by that we mean virtually every person in the Republican political class and the political media -- has an opinion about what Romney should say and how he should say it.      We talked to a number of GOP strategist types over the past 24 hours to get their impressions of what Romney should say tonight. Their takes, plus a few thoughts of our own, are below.      * Mitt the Man: Romney tells his own personal story sparingly -- and not all that well. That has to change tonight for the speech to be deemed a success. While Romney will never reach the rhetorical heights in re-telling his life story of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, he has to find a way to break through the idea that most people have of him as a buttoned up, entitled rich guy. He has a good example to follow in doing just that; his wife Ann's speech on Tuesday night was an effective re-casting of the Romney narrative from one centered on huge homes and car elevators to one centered on a turned-over sawhorse as a desk and tuna fish as a preferred meal. Even more important than what Romney says about himself, however, may be how he says it. Romney has to look more comfortable in his own skin than he has in past big speeches when talking about himself.      * Religion as Romney's secret weapon?: As a corollary to that first point, we have long argued that Romney is far better off embracing his Mormonism than running from it. For a candidate who has spent the last five-plus years fighting the perception that he lacks any consistent core, Romney's dedication to his faith could fill that void. And yet, as we noted above, he's never been comfortable talking about any aspect of his personal life with his religion at the top of that list. The question for Romney tonight is whether he can borrow a bit of the language -- in sentiment if not in the actual words -- of Paul Ryan's speech on Wednesday in which the Wisconsin Republican noted that while the two men don't share the same church, they share the same values. If Romney doesn't talk about his faith in some somewhat extended way, count us as believing he made a mistake.      * Ignore the room: The biggest mistake a nominee can make in his acceptance speech is to target the few thousand people in the convention hall. Those people are already in Romney's camp; they are the most active of party activists. What Romney needs to do is remember that the real audience for his speech are the millions of people watching it on their TV sets. And for many of those people, it may be their first extended glimpse of Romney ever. That means Romney should largely steer away from throwing red meat to the conservative crowd -- the audience will be amped up for Romney almost no matter what he says -- and instead focusing on telling his story and laying out his vision for moving the country forward.      * The vision \\"thing\\": Speaking of laying out a vision, Romney needs to do it. Not a series of policy proposals -- although he probably should do a bit of that too -- but rather a big vision of where he would take the country. To date, Romney has largely run on two conceits: 1. I am not Barack Obama 2. I can bring business principles to governance. To which many voters seem to say \\"Yes, but....\\". There's a reason that although the economy continues to be an anchor around the feet of President Obama, Romney isn't soaring. And it's because people want more from Romney. Remember that voters tend to want to cast a vote FOR something/someone rather than just against someone/something. Tonight is Romney's chance to give people a big -- and positive -- vision to vote for.      * Serious man for serious times: Romney will never match President Obama in the charisma department. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Romney just needs to be who he is – an executive who makes decisions and gets results,\\" said Republican consultant Curt Anderson. \\"We’ve had four years of Mr. Personality and it hasn’t helped our economy. That’s what Romney needs to convey tonight, and I bet he will.\\" Romney has to be careful not to be too workmanlike in his address (see \\"the vision thing\\" above) but the more he can project himself as a guy who may not bowl you over as a speaker but who has the resume to make the economy better in office, the better he will do. ||||| Romney's speech will be one of his last chances to sketch a portrait of who he is. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Mitt's make-or-break night      TAMPA, Fla. — Mitt Romney is about to face the most important political moment of his life.      The speech Romney delivers at the Republican National Convention’s final night in Tampa will be one of his last opportunities to sketch a portrait of who he is and what he stands for to a country whose battleground states have seen him relentlessly portrayed by the Obama campaign as a heartless corporate raider — a perception that has dented his approval ratings and made it difficult for the GOP to change the campaign narrative.      Story Continued Below      In a precious hour before a national television audience, Romney has the opportunity to connect with voters in the convention hall but also well beyond. There is a deeper, softer, and much kinder side to Romney, those who know him insist, but he provides only those closest to him with a view of it. He has run the least biographically anchored campaign of any presidential nominee in recent history, declining to present his own fleshed-out accounts of his time at Bain Capital, his time as a bishop in the Mormon church, or his term as Massachusetts governor.      ( Also on POLITICO: All the GOP convention speeches)      That case has been made for him over the first three days of the convention through speeches and videos — and most dramatically through a Tuesday night prime-time appeal from his wife, Ann, — that his experience as an executive, church leader, Olympics chief and dad have created a three-dimensional, attractive candidate, not the caricature Republicans feel the Obama campaign team has created.      The aim has been to “make the argument that all these things have prepared him to make him uniquely qualified to handle all the things” the country is facing, said Romney adviser Russ Schriefer, who has masterminded the convention programming. “There’s lots of different ways that he can tell that story.”      But few will be as important as the speech he delivers himself.      ( Also on POLITICO: Text and video of Ann Romney’s speech)      He needs to make his case for the presidency, but he also needs to let the shrinking pool of undecided voters who are watching see who he is and what kind of president he would be. He needs elements of George H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light,” George W. Bush’s, “They have not led. We will,” and John McCain’s straight talk to describe his own career. But he needs to show his humanity.      Romney’s speeches are usually drafted by committee, then he tears into them, or he writes portions himself.      The words he says tonight will be authentically his, for better or worse.      ( PHOTOS: Scenes from the RNC)      With that in mind, here are five ways Romney can use his speech to maximum effect:      1. Go bold. The Romney campaign has used that word frequently to describe the choice of Paul Ryan on the ticket.      But while choosing the controversial Wisconsin congressman was politically risky, Romney has largely reverted back to his no-details posture, the one he’s had for much of the campaign.      The convention speech is not the place for policy planks. But it is the place for Romney to show he can be bigger.      “Republicans have a tendency to ask voters to choose our medicine because it tastes the worst, not because it works the best,” said Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, who worked on Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign.      “We need to explain that if you vote for Romney-Ryan, you are not voting for less, you are voting for more,” he added. “More growth, more jobs, more prosperity, bigger paychecks, and more government revenue to save Medicare and Social Security, too. We need to put the Democrats on the defensive on austerity. We need to explain that Obama is the one asking you to settle for less.”      To make that case, Romney should pitch his own plans, in as much of a positive frame as possible. He needs to explain why picking Ryan wasn’t about getting editorial board headlines with the word “bold,” but that he shares Ryan’s principles, that he believes the nation is headed down the wrong path and that he wants to do what is politically risky but philosophically right.      That kind of language hasn’t been Romney’s strong suit before. But he needs to present voters with the path forward. ||||| Solution:","output":"In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has the opportunity to connect with voters and present a clearer portrait of who he is.

How do you say \\"Hourly Stats for August 12, 2018\\" in Spanish?","output":"To say \\"Hourly Stats for August 12, 2018\\" in Spanish, you can use the following translation: \\"Estadísticas por hora para el 12 de agosto de 2018\\". Let's break it down: 1. \\"Hourly Stats\\" can be translated to \\"Estadísticas por hora\\". The word \\"Estadísticas\\" means \\"Stats\\" in Spanish, and the term \\"por hora\\" stands for \\"Hourly\\".         a) Estadísticas: This term is the plural form of the word \\"Estadística\\" which means \\"Statistic\\" in English. In the context of the phrase, \\"Estadísticas\\" refers to a collection of data or figures representing the hourly statistics.    b) Por hora: This term is composed of two words – \\"por\\" which is a preposition that denotes a proportional relationship, and \\"hora\\" which is the Spanish word for \\"hour\\". In the context of this phrase, \\"por hora\\" signifies the data or statistics are being represented in hourly intervals. 2. \\"For\\" can be translated as “para” in Spanish. \\"Para\\" is a preposition used to express purpose or destination. In this particular context, it is used to connect the hourly stats with the specific date. 3. \\"August 12, 2018\\" can be translated to \\"el 12 de agosto de 2018\\". In Spanish, dates follow a different format than in English. It uses the format \\"day-month-year\\" with the word \\"de\\" functioning as the preposition \\"of\\" to connect the day with the month and year.    a) El: This is a definite article equivalent to the English \\"the\\", used here to determine the day.    b) 12: It remains the same as in English, the number representing the day of the month.    c) De: This preposition stands for \\"of\\" in English and is used to join the day and the month.    d) Agosto: This is the Spanish word for \\"August\\", the eighth month of the year.    e) De: We use this preposition again to join the month \\"agosto\\" and the year \\"2018\\".    f) 2018: This remains the same as in English. So, putting it all together, “Hourly Stats for August 12, 2018” can be translated as “Estadísticas por hora para el 12 de agosto de 2018” in Spanish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Star Wars Casting? | TIME.com But only if you're a \\"physically fit\\" young actor Almost nothing about this is actually confirmed, but reliable movie-business columnist Roger Friedman is suggesting that the casting for three big Star Wars Episode VII has begun. Friedman has his hands on a casting sheet for an untitled movie—one that is, rather notably, to be directed by J.J. Abrams and to come from Disney. (If they’re working on a different project, we’ve never heard of it). Here are the three parts being sought: [YOUNG MAN] Early 20s. Handsome, but not necessarily heroic. He is witty and smart. Physically fit. [MAN] Late 20s. Physically fit, handsome and confident. [YOUNG WOMAN] Late teens. Physically fit, raw energy, independent and with a great sense of humor. Friedman guesses these young and “physically fit” characters might be Skywalker and Solo spawn (we’d hazard that the first is Luke’s and the third is Leia/Han; number two could go either way). An earlier casting call for the same project also sought older actors for a variety of roles. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world of Star Wars casting, other rumors continue to swirl, especially over whether Benedict Cumberbatch will follow his Star Trek Into Darkness director to a leading role in Star Wars.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people.

White House accused of abandoning imprisoned US aid worker in Cuba The Obama administration was accused on Tuesday of abandoning a US aid worker imprisoned in Cuba and of endangering his life by running a “cockamamie” program to create a Twitter-like network on the island nation. Senator Patrick Leahy challenged Rajiv Shah, the head of the US agency for international development, to explain why the agency had moved forward with the “Cuban Twitter” program, known as ZunZuneo, after the aid worker, Alan Gross, was arrested in December 2009. “Did USAid consider that the possible discovery of this program, which USAid knew about … if the Cuban government discovered it, did anybody consider what that might have meant for Alan Gross?” Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, asked Shah at an appropriations subcommittee hearing. “Alan’s detention is wrong,” Shah said. “The responsibility for his detention rests with Cuban authorities.” The ZunZuneo program was first exposed last week in a report by the Associated Press. In a blogpost Monday, USAid, a 1960s-era agency with a core mission of fighting poverty and hunger abroad while flying the US flag, defended the ZunZuneo program as in line with its broader mission. Leahy on Tuesday called USAid’s surveillance mission “dumb in its inception”, and described it as a “cockamamie” idea that was doomed to fail. “Why would we put that mission as part of USAid?” asked senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska. “To me it seems crazy. It just seems crazy that you would be in the middle of that. That’s just my observation.” Shah defended USAid’s communications infiltration activities as a “core part of what USAid has done for some time and continues to do,” in Cuba “and in many other parts of the world.” The agency has an annual budget of 15-20m to spend on “democracy programs” in Cuba. Gross was a government contractor employed by USAid to carry out an infiltration program that was not part of ZunZuneo. Gross, who is serving a 15-year sentence, began a hunger strike last week to protest Obama administration inaction on his imprisonment. “As far as I can tell, USAid and the Obama administration has all but forgotten about him,” Leahy said. “Told by the administration, ‘Well, if you only knew all the things we’re doing’ – all I know is whatever they’re doing hasn’t accomplished one darn thing. Whatever past attempts they’ve made have achieved nothing.” Shah, 41, a former executive with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is credited with having revitalized USAid since he took over in 2009. Under Shah’s leadership the agency has dramatically cut back on the portion of its approximately 20bn budget that goes to government contractor and funneled more money into loan guarantees for local banks and other local organizations in target countries. Praise at Tuesday’s hearing for the agency’s work was overshadowed, however, by a sense of disbelief that USAid seemed to be dabbling in spycraft. Shah said the ZunZuneo program was “discreet” but “absolutely not” covert. “This program has been notified publicly in Congressional budget notifications,” he said, referring to internal budget breakdowns. “The notifications point out that we are working to increase the free flow of information and support civil society engagement using new technology.” Leahy said the budget notifications did not count as making the programs public. “I’ve read those,” he said. “Talk about bureaucratese. If you could figure out that it meant this, you’re doing a lot better job than most of us.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The Obama administration was accused of abandoning a US aid worker named Alan Gross, who was imprisoned in Cuba. 2. Senator Patrick Leahy criticized the administration for running a \\"Cuban Twitter\\" program, called ZunZuneo, which he believed put Gross's life in danger. 3. ZunZuneo program was exposed in a report by the Associated Press and defended by USAid as in line with its broader mission. 4. US senators questioned the appropriateness of USAid’s involvement in the program and expressed concern about the wellbeing of Gross. 5. Rajiv Shah, head of USAid, stated that the ZunZuneo program was discreet but not covert and was a part of the agency's activities in many parts of the world. 6. Shah also mentioned that an annual budget of 15-20 million was allocated for \\"democracy programs\\" in Cuba, but the senators criticized the administration's efforts in securing Gross's release as ineffective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is calledlokahiin the Hawaiian language, which means \\"oneness with all people\\". To enjoy the land you should not be selfish. The land is for everyone who lives on. Today many different people call Hawaii their home. Indeed, Hawaii is a place where people make one big community from many smaller communities. Each person giveskokua(help) to other people so that all feel stronger. It is believed that the islands can be a paradise  when people live in peace. People are told that their actions should be as gentle as the wind that blows from the sea. When problems happen, people are asked to solve them with understanding. So when people of Hawaii talk aboutohana(family), they are really talking about all those who live on the island. Living in peace, Hawaiians have developed a third sign of friendship.

A) A warm handshake. B) A kiss on the cheek. C) A string of flowers. D) A big hug. Answer:","output":"C) A string of flowers. In Hawaiian culture, one of the signs of friendship is demonstrated through the exchange of leis. A lei is a string of flowers that is placed over a friend's neck as a symbol of personal friendship and affection. Along with the lei, a kiss on the cheek might also be given to the friend. The tradition of giving leis is not only displayed among locals but also extended to visitors arriving on the island, making them feel welcomed and part of the ohana, or family.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Japanese road reopens one week after vast sinkhole appeared A section of road in the centre of the Japanese city of Fukuoka has reopened just days after a sinkhole opened up outside a busy railway station and threatened to topple nearby buildings. In a typical demonstration of Japanese workmanship and efficiency, workers toiled around the clocks and had practically filled in the section of road in just two days, according to local media. The road reopened to traffic and pedestrians early on Tuesday after local officials declared the repaired stretch safe. The weeklong rush to reopen the busy stretch of road included repairs to a sewage pipe and replacing traffic lights and utility poles that were swallowed when the sinkhole opened up shortly after 5am local time on 8 November. The incident caused power cuts and disrupted phone signals, and gas and water supplies, but there were no reports of injuries. The mayor of Fukuoka, Soichiro Takashima, said the affected ground was now 30 times stronger than before, adding that a panel of experts would be set up to establish the cause of the cave-in. Local media reports said the 30m by 27m sinkhole, which was 15 metres deep, was caused by construction work on an extension to an underground line. The Fukuoka workers, who filled the hole with 6,200 cubic metres of sand and cement, drew praise on social media. One person tweeted: “I’m surprised the road reopened in a week!” Another said: “Impressive. That was fast.” The astonishing speed of the repair work brought back memories of the efforts to reopen roads that were badly damaged by the March 2011 triple disaster. Before-and-after-photos showed how a team of workers took just six days to repair gaping cracks up to 150 metres along a stretch of road north of Tokyo, boosting attempts by emergency and aid workers trying to reach hundreds of thousands of survivors. Summary:","output":"A big hole appeared in a road in Fukuoka, Japan, near a busy train station. It was caused by construction work.

Summarize: An interesting way to spark a riveting conversation is to debate. Simply choose a topic and have one person argue for it and another to argue against it.  Remind yourself and your companions that the debate is just a game. A fun debate can quickly turn into a heated argument that might create discomfort between everyone in the car. Choose funny and light-hearted topics. Avoid heavy or complex topics to keep everyone in good spirits. Instead of arguing about morals or religious beliefs, debate about whether strawberries are the best kind of berry or whether squirrels are cute or just plain annoying. There are many word games that can be competitively fun and entertaining, in situations where you're driving alone or with others:  Have a spelling bee. Name all the countries of the world. Name all the states or provinces or a country. Think of words that rhyme with each other as fast as you can. Whoever stops the pace, loses. Say one word at a time. Have each person say one word to create a sentence or story. You might come up with some hilarious examples. Read aloud a book or play and have everyone in the car act out a role or multiple roles. The driver should not participate in this game. If you're driving with others, get to know one another. Ask each other questions or play a variety of games:  Play two truths and a lie. Have one person tell two truths and a lie. The others must guess which statements are truths and which one is a lie. Play Never Have I Ever. Each person will keep track of their own points, or hold up 10 fingers, or even be prepared to drink or eat something every time someone says something they have never done, but has actually done the activity. For example, Sally will say, \\"Never have I ever danced on stage.\\" If Bob has danced on stage before, he will lose a point or have to eat or drink something to show that he has indeed done that activity. Play truth or dare. However, be careful when designing the dares, ensuring that they can be safely done inside or outside the car. See how many things you can see during your car ride. You can try counting:  Certain colours of cars. People walking on the road. Birds. Animals. Certain chain stores or buildings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the son of the man who was brother of Clemuel? ?  Ricketts Glen State Park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. Luzerne County was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County, and Fairmount Township, where the waterfalls are, was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834. About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \\"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\\", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.The Ricketts family began acquiring land in and around what became the park in 1851, when Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) on North Mountain around what is now known as Ganoga Lake. By 1852 they had built a stone house on the lake shore, which they ran \\"as a lodge and tavern\\". Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and began purchasing the land around the lake from his father in 1869; eventually he controlled or owned more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls.Ricketts and the other settlers living in the area were not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865,... Answer:","output":"The first name of the son of the man who was brother of Clemuel is Robert Bruce. In the text, it is mentioned that \\"Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) on North Mountain.\\" Then it states: \\"Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named,\\" which indicates that Robert Bruce is the son of the man who was a brother to Clemuel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: The Perfect Post-Sauna Routine for Optimal Relaxation and Rejuvenation Introduction Saunas have long been known for their numerous health benefits, providing a soothing, stress-relieving environment where the gentle heat relaxes muscles, eliminates toxins, and rejuvenates both body and mind. However, just as important as the sauna experience itself is giving proper attention to your post-sauna routine. Engaging in the right activities and nourishing your body appropriately after a sauna session can significantly enhance its therapeutic effects and ensure you get the most out of this time-honored ritual. Step 1: Air Dry Your Skin Upon leaving the sauna, make sure to let your skin air dry instead of using a towel. This not only feels refreshing and cool but also allows your body to continue expelling toxins through the process of natural perspiration. While you're cooling down, take this opportunity to practice deep breathing exercises, which help release tension and promote an overall sense of calm. Allow your body to gradually adjust to the change in temperature, and try to avoid abrupt exposure to cold air or an icy shower right after your sauna session. This sudden change can constrict blood vessels, hinder circulation, and negate the benefits of your time in the heat. Step 2: Hydrate Throughout the Day Staying well-hydrated is absolutely essential for reaping the maximum benefits of your sauna experience. The high heat and humidity of a sauna can quickly lead to dehydration if you're not careful. To avoid any negative effects this might cause, make sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your sauna session. Keep a water bottle by your side and continuously replenish your body's fluids, making it a point to sip water at regular intervals throughout the entire day. This will not only prevent dehydration but also help flush out toxins and impurities that have been released during your time in the sauna. Step 3: Nourish Your Body with a Snack or Light Meal A sauna session can be quite draining on the body, particularly if it's an intense one. As such, it's crucial to refuel your body with nutritious food that will provide it with the energy and nutrients it needs to recover properly. Opt for a snack or light meal that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, as well as proteins necessary for muscle repair. Some excellent post-sauna food choices include fresh fruits, leafy greens, nuts, whole grains, yogurt, and lean protein sources like chicken or fish. Consuming these foods will help your body replenish its depleted resources, enabling you to regain strength and vitality more rapidly. Step 4: Take It Easy for the Rest of the Day One of the primary objectives of using a sauna is to relax and rejuvenate, so it's important to let your body continue this process throughout the rest of the day. This means avoiding rigorous physical activities or engaging in anything that might induce stress. Instead, engage in gentle, low-impact exercise like stretching or yoga, or indulge in a leisurely walk in nature. Take this time to engage in activities that promote relaxation and mindfulness, such as meditation, reading, or a calming hobby. Conclusion Incorporating these steps into your post-sauna routine is essential to ensure that your body effectively reaps the full range of health benefits offered by the sauna experience. By adequately nourishing and hydrating your body, as well as observing a stress-free remainder of the day, you will be able to maximize the potential of your sauna session, leaving you feeling profoundly relaxed, rejuvenated, and refreshed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – On the laundry list of public despair over government's inability to do anything right, \\"executing criminals\\" doesn't usually get a mention—particularly in Iran, which is more than a little practiced at capital punishment. But the Guardian presents the case of Alireza, a 37-year-old drug smuggler sentenced to death for having been found in possession of a kilo of meth. Earlier this month, Iranian officials strung him up, hanged him for 12 minutes, cut him down, pronounced him dead, and sent the body off to be buried. Except morgue workers the next day noticed steam in the plastic in which he was wrapped ... and the state found itself resuscitating and hospitalizing the guy it had failed to properly kill. \\"We couldn't believe he was still alive when we went to collect his body,\\" a relative says, adding that \\"his two daughters are very happy.\\" Only now Iranian judges want to hang him again—as soon as he's fully recovered—saying that they in fact sentenced him to death, not hanging, so his sentence hasn't been carried out. Amnesty International is predictably appalled, saying that \\"carrying it out twice\\" is \\"simply ghastly\\" and \\"betrays a basic lack of humanity,\\" and, anyway, \\"the death penalty is not working in the fight against drug trafficking.\\" Iran is thought to have executed (successfully) 508 people so far this year, adds the Telegraph; that's a number that hasn't exactly slowed since Hasan Rouhani's election, with 125 of those coming since he took office in August. Most executions are for drug-related offenses.","output":"Title: The Disquieting Case of Alireza: Iran's Capital Punishment Controversy Introduction On the ever-growing laundry list of public despair over the government's inability to do anything right, the execution of criminals does not usually garner much attention. However, in Iran, which frequently practices capital punishment, one particular case has raised concerns and sparked debate surrounding the efficacy and morality of the death penalty. The botched execution of Alireza Alireza, a 37-year-old drug smuggler, was sentenced to death after being found in possession of a kilogram of methamphetamine. Earlier this month, Iranian officials hanged him for 12 minutes, cut him down, and pronounced him dead. His body was then sent off to be buried. However, the following day, morgue workers noticed steam in the plastic wrap used to cover his body and discovered that he was still alive. The state found itself in the unforeseen predicament of resuscitating and hospitalizing the man they had failed to properly execute. Family and human rights organizations' reactions \\"We couldn't believe he was still alive when we went to collect his body,\\" a relative says, adding that \\"his two daughters are very happy.\\" Amnesty International, however, is appalled at the prospect of re-executing Alireza, asserting that \\"carrying it out twice\\" is \\"simply ghastly\\" and \\"betrays a basic lack of humanity.\\" The organization also points out that the death penalty is not making headway in the fight against drug trafficking. Iran's stance on capital punishment Iran is known for its frequent employment of capital punishment, having executed (successfully) 508 people so far this year, a figure that has not diminished since President Hasan Rouhani's election. Out of those executions, 125 occurred after he took office in August. Most executions are for drug-related offenses.  Now, Iranian judges are pushing for the re-execution of Alireza once he has fully recovered, stating that they had sentenced him to death, not hanging, so his original sentence has yet to be carried out. Conclusion The disturbing case of Alireza highlights the flaws and controversies of capital punishment in Iran. As human rights organizations such as Amnesty International condemn the practice and fight for its abolition, the Iranian government must grapple with the morality and pragmatism of its actions. In the midst of the ongoing debate over capital punishment, it is critical that questions about humanity, justice, and effectiveness are not lost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Context: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Additionally, the speaker emphasizes that there are also myriad problems that exist closer to home. In the context of the statement, \\"our own back door\\" likely refers to the speaker's own community, state, or nation. Therefore, the hypothesis: \\"We have enough of our own problems to deal with\\" can be considered true within the scope of the speaker's perspective. To fully understand the validity of the hypothesis, it is important to consider the various issues that are being faced globally, including conflicts, economic distress, and political tensions. In the case of the Middle East, the ongoing conflicts in the area, such as Israel-Palestine disputes and civil wars in neighboring Arab nations, emphasize the complexity and severity of the situation. The speaker seems to suggest that, while these problems are indeed pressing, there are also issues of comparable importance that directly impact their own community. Further support for the hypothesis can be found in the fact that every society tends to face a myriad of challenges. These can range from inadequate infrastructure and public services to socio-economic inequality and environmental concerns. Communities and nations need to allocate resources and attention to address these issues, and the emphasis on 'having enough problems to deal with' denotes the necessity for focusing on local issues before considering problems on a much larger and distant scale. In conclusion, based on the speaker's premise, the hypothesis \\"We have enough of our own problems to deal with\\" is generally considered true. This statement serves as a reminder that individuals and communities must recognize and prioritize the local issues they face. By addressing these immediate problems, societies can begin to establish a stronger foundation upon which they can tackle larger, more complex problems, such as those present in the Middle East or in other global contexts. However, it's essential to draft a balance between taking care of internal issues and addressing global issues as well since the latter may have direct or indirect consequences on the former."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She can also think about potential locations for photographs, such as a scenic backdrop or a specific area at the prom venue, and coordinate with Skylar to ensure they have enough time for picture-taking before the event starts. 5. Confirming the schedule with Skylar: Communication is key, so Sasha should confirm the date and time of the event, arrange a meeting time and place with Skylar, and discuss any pre-prom or post-prom plans, such as a group dinner or attending an after-party. This will help ensure that both Sasha and Skylar are on the same page and have a seamless evening. 6. Getting in shape and practicing dance moves: Sasha may want to improve her fitness and practice her dance moves before the prom, especially if she anticipates dancing the night away with Skylar. This could include joining a dance class, practicing at home, or working on her overall fitness with regular exercise. 7. Establishing a budget: It's important for Sasha to set a budget for prom expenses, such as the dress, accessories, hair and makeup, transportation, and any other miscellaneous costs. This can help her make informed decisions and avoid overspending. By completing these steps, Sasha can ensure that she is well-prepared for a fantastic prom night with Skylar, filled with great memories and fun experiences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist., what would be the answer ?

In Guazacapán, now a municipality in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla.

And with the exception of young boys, they aren't really any taller. The new statistics come from the CDC, which found the average American man now weighs 195.7 pounds—15 pounds more than in the late '80s and early '90s—and the average American woman now weighs 168.5 pounds—up 16 pounds over the past 20 years, according to Time. Live Science reports the CDC also found that waistlines were increasing over that time span. And NJ.com points out that the increase puts the BMI of the average man (28.9) and average woman (28.8) near the official obesity level of 30. The CDC found the average American man is 5-feet-9-inches tall, and the average American woman is 5-feet-4-inches tall. Those heights are unchanged over the past two decades. However, average 11-year-old boys are now an inch taller (and 13.5 pounds heavier). The largest weight gains between now and then were seen in men between the ages of 60 and 69 and women between 20 and 29. The CDC's report didn't give reasons for the increase in weight, but an expert who describes it as a \\"fairly rapid rate\\" of weight gain, tells HealthDay that less exercise and more calorie-heavy foods are to blame. (Italian researchers don't think pasta is making us fat, at least.) Expand this summary.","output":"Over the past two decades, the average weight of Americans has experienced a significant increase, with adults gaining around 15-16 pounds on average. According to recent statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average weight for American men has reached 195.7 pounds, while the average weight for American women is now at 168.5 pounds. Concurrently, waistlines have been expanding, and the BMI for both genders is nearing the official obesity level of 30. Interestingly, the height of the average American adult did not show any changes during this time period, with men staying at an average height of 5-feet-9-inches tall and women at 5-feet-4-inches tall. However, an exception was observed in average 11-year-old boys, who now measure an inch taller and 13.5 pounds heavier than two decades ago. The most significant weight gains were noted in men aged between 60 and 69, and women aged between 20 and 29. While the CDC's report does not provide specific reasons for the increase in weight, experts believe that lack of exercise and consumption of calorie-dense foods contribute to the problem. The weight increase among Americans indicates a serious concern for public health, as it may lead to an escalation in obesity rates and several related health issues. Obesity is linked to multiple chronic health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Additionally, obesity puts a strain on the healthcare system and may also impact work productivity and the economy. To combat this alarming trend, it is crucial for individuals and public health agencies to promote healthier lifestyles and better nutrition. Encouraging regular physical activity and consumption of a well-balanced diet consisting of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables is essential. Moreover, healthcare providers play a critical role in raising awareness about the risks associated with obesity and educating patients on how to maintain a healthy weight. Furthermore, government agencies and public health organizations should endorse policies and initiatives aimed at creating healthier environments for individuals and families. This may include efforts to improve the accessibility of healthy foods in schools and workplaces, urging food manufacturers to reduce harmful ingredients (such as added sugars, artificial trans fats, and excessive sodium), as well as promoting public spaces and community programs that support physical activity. In conclusion, the rise in average weight among Americans over the past two decades is a serious public health concern that requires immediate attention. By promoting healthy lifestyles, improving nutrition, and fostering supportive environments, individuals and communities can work together to reverse this trend and reduce the risks associated with obesity and related health conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan.

The Killian documents, presented during a 60 Minutes segment in 2004, were purported to be memos written in the early 1970s by President George W. Bush's superior in the Texas Air National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian. These documents raised questions regarding President Bush's fulfillment of his National Guard duty and suggested that he might have received preferential treatment owing to his family's political connections. The documents received significant media attention, with further investigations into their authenticity quickly casting doubt on their legitimacy. It later became a significant controversy for CBS News as the authenticity of the documents was called into question. Critics claimed that the documents were likely forgeries, based on discrepancies in the typewriting, formatting, and language used in the memos, pointing to the likelihood that they were created using modern word processing programs rather than the typewriters in use at the time the memos were allegedly written. The controversy led CBS News to appoint a panel to investigate the issue, ultimately resulting in the admission that the news organization could not prove the authenticity of the documents, and several CBS News staff members being asked to resign or being terminated.

In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\".

Answer:","output":"To determine which gas is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container, we'll refer to the Ideal Gas Law, which is illustrated by the equation PV = nRT. In this equation, P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles/amount of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since the container holds both Mologen and Hamogen, we can say that the total pressure inside (P_total) is the sum of the partial pressures of Mologen (P_Mologen) and Hamogen (P_Hamogen): P_total = P_Mologen + P_Hamogen. Given that there is a large portion of Mologen and a smaller portion of Hamogen in the container, and without any additional information about the specific amounts, temperatures, or the gases' properties, we can conclude that it is more likely that Mologen is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container, as the pressure of a gas is directly related to the amount of gas present in the same volume and under the same temperature conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: For what company does Francis Brown work? Movie title: Exotica Movie plot: A tax auditor for Revenue Canada, Francis Brown, is a regular visitor at a Toronto strip club called Exotica. Grieving for the loss of his murdered daughter, he always has Christina, an exotic dancer dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, give him a private dance. This inspires the jealousy of the club's DJ Eric, Christina's former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club's owner Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold's young daughter to babysit. However, Francis has no children left and the girl merely practices music alone until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis' relationship with his brother is strained, as the police have told Francis that Harold had an affair with his wife before she died in a car accident, that left Harold a paraplegic. In his professional life, Francis is sent to Thomas' pet store to audit books of account pursuant to the suspicion that Thomas is profiting from the illegal import of rare bird species. Thomas has been smuggling hyacinth macaw eggs, and his operation is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Francis is eventually banned from Exotica when Eric manipulates him into touching Christina during one of her dances, which is against the rules of the club. Around the same time, Francis discovers illegal activities in Thomas' financial records, and blackmails Thomas to go to the club to learn Christina's feelings about Francis. In the process, Francis realizes Eric intentionally set out to get him banned, and vows to kill him. Confronting Eric with a gun, Francis is defused when Eric reveals he was the one who found the girl's body. Christina also reveals to Thomas that she and Francis share a relationship of mutual dependency. In the past when she used to babysit his daughter, Francis would comfort her about her troubled life at home.

Fentanyl: DEA sees dramatic surge in opioid cases Law enforcement agencies submit drug products to the Drug Enforcement Administration for testing. From 2013 to 2014, 426% more products tested positive for fentanyl, according to new numbers from the . In the same time period, deaths from synthetic opioids increased by 79%. But that 79% might actually underestimate the number of deaths from synthetic opioids; the CDC was able to evaluate only the 27 states that had consistent death certificate reporting of the drugs involved in overdoses. The analysis did not include New Mexico, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania or Delaware, states that respectively had the second-, sixth-, eighth- and ninth-highest rates of overdose in the country. The CDC estimates that the 27 states evaluated represent 75% of the synthetic opioid deaths in the country. In its analysis, it further drilled down on the states that have had the biggest rise in fentanyl-related deaths and seizures, hoping to better understand how illicit fentanyl is making an impact. Though the number of heroin-related deaths is still greater than those from fentanyl, CDC behavioral scientist Matthew Gladden said, \\"the issue [of fentanyl] seems to be spreading and growing. The number of samples law enforcement submits for testing is still increasing and spreading.\\" Fentanyl is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. According to the DEA, illicit fentanyl is not being diverted from hospitals, but rather being sourced from China and Mexico and making its way into street drugs in the United States. Often, it is passed off as heroin or some other pill and users have no idea that they are taking the dangerous drug. Dealers are also cutting heroin and other drugs with it, because illicit fentanyl is cheap and allows them to stretch their supply. This year in California, fentanyl was passed off as the prescription drug and sold on the street. In just 10 days, one batch was responsible for at least 10 deaths and 48 overdoses. Most recently, an outbreak of nearly in just five days in western Cincinnati was linked to illicit fentanyl. After his death in April, pop star Prince's toxicology report found fentanyl in his system. Investigators seized from his Paisley Park compound that were labeled as hydrocodone, but actually contained fentanyl. It's difficult to determine just how much illicit fentanyl is out there because there are so many newly emerging variants or analogues, and many medical examiners and toxicologists are just beginning to test for it. Deaths from fentanyl itself are not reported in national data. Just six of the states evaluated by the CDC actually track deaths from the drug: Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Ohio. When totaling those states' numbers, there was an increase of 1,008 fentanyl-specific deaths between 2013 and 2014. In the same time period, there were 966 more deaths from other synthetic opioids, indicating that illicit fentanyl is driving much of the increase. Ohio has been one of the places hardest hit by the epidemic. In 2014, it had the second largest number of opioid-related deaths in the country and the fifth highest rate of overdose. In Ohio between 2013 and 2014, fentanyl submissions to DEA labs by law enforcement increased by 1,043%, while fentanyl-related deaths increased by 526%. Yet in the same time period, prescriptions for fentanyl actually dropped by 7% in the state. The growing presence of fentanyl, combined with its potency, is causing public health experts to sound the alarm. formerly a director in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and currently a professor of psychobiology at Harvard Medical School, likened illicit fentanyl to crack cocaine. \\"It enters the brain much more quickly,\\" she said. But unlike crack, which is three times stronger than cocaine, some fentanyl analogues are 100 times more powerful than regular fentanyl. \\"I would say it's like crack on steroids,\\" Madras said. Gladden added, \\"The key message to the rest of the country is for states that haven't seen illicitly made fentanyl, they need to be vigilant.\\" He said states need to be ready with plenty of naloxone, a drug that can counteract opioid overdose, and make efforts to reach out to harm-reduction groups to help counter the impact of illicit fentanyl. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Fentanyl is a very strong medicine that helps people, especially cancer patients, with their pain. It is much stronger than other pain medicines like morphine and heroin. Sadly, some bad people are making fentanyl in a wrong way and selling it as different drugs. This is dangerous because it can make people very sick and can even cause death. There have been many more cases of this happening in recent years, so people are trying to be more careful and figure out how to stop it. It is important to make sure that people know what they are taking and where their medicine comes from to stay safe."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Estelle and John  for the following movie plot:  Mari Collingwood plans to attend a concert with her friend, Phyllis Stone for her 17th birthday.

His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. Context: After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent. He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.  In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called penas to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumen, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda.  In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pena de Los Parra, owned by Angel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva Cancion movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, Canto a lo humano, in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \\"Plegaria a un Labrador\\" (\\"Prayer to a Worker\\") and \\"Te Recuerdo Amanda\\" (\\"I Remember You Amanda\\"). Question: What was Jara's artistic work like Answer:","output":"Victor Jara's artistic work was mainly focused on folk music and songs that talked about the lives of regular people, like workers and farmers. He used traditional styles of music from Chile and other Latin American countries, and he got ideas from other artists like Violeta Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. Jara's songs were special because they also talked about important ideas, like helping people and standing up for what's right. Some of his famous songs are \\"Prayer to a Worker\\" and \\"I Remember You Amanda.\\" Before focusing on music, Jara also worked in theater and acted in plays that showed the tough life of poor people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris.

For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\".

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge  . Question: What can we learn from Carla's story? Answer: Choices:  (A). BED is an incurable disease.;  (B). BED has something to do with genes.;  (C). Going on a diet won't help BED patients.;  (D). BED patients should pay attention to their food.; The answer is:","output":"(C).

Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic conquered 70% of Bosnia with their arsenal of tanks, aircraft and howitzers bequeathed by the Yugoslav army. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Nationalists conquered the majority of Bosnia.","output":"Yes, the next sentence follows given the preceding text. Here's a detailed explanation: In the preceding text, we learn about the gunmen who were loyal to the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic. These armed men used a variety of powerful weapons, such as tanks, aircraft, and howitzers. They obtained these weapons from the former Yugoslav army, which had either surrendered or disbanded.  As a result of their military force and determination, the gunmen managed to conquer roughly 70% of Bosnia, which is more than two-thirds of the territory. This represents a significant portion of the country and a clear demonstration of their strength and control. The following sentence – \\"Nationalists conquered the majority of Bosnia\\" – effectively summarizes the main point of the preceding text. The term \\"nationalists\\" refers to the gunmen who were loyal to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader. By conquering the majority of Bosnia, they successfully advanced their nationalist agenda and extended their influence over a substantial part of the country. Therefore, the next sentence is an accurate and concise summary of the situation described in the preceding text. It captures the key idea – the nationalists were able to take control over the majority of Bosnia with their display of firepower and military strength.

Answer:","output":"The Warumpi Band was an influential Australian rock group that was active from 1980 to 2000. Hailing from Papunya, Northern Territory, Australia, the band's sound was a unique fusion of country rock, blues rock, and Aboriginal rock. The group was composed of past members George Burarrwanga, Gordon Butcher, Sammy Butcher, and Neil Murray. The band's original lineup came together in the remote Aboriginal community of Papunya, where the members bonded over their shared love for music. Their name, Warumpi, comes from a local honey ant species that lives in a sacred dreaming site nearby. Warumpi Band were pioneers in incorporating indigenous themes and languages into their music, making them a vital force in the Australian rock scene. They achieved mainstream success and critical acclaim, thanks to their powerful sound and politically charged lyrics. Throughout their 20-year career, they released several albums under various record labels such as Hot, Powderworks/RCA, Festival/Parole, and CAAMA/Shock. One of Warumpi Band's most notable associated acts was Midnight Oil, another legendary Australian rock band. Both bands shared not only a similarly energetic rock sound but also a deep concern for social and political issues, especially those affecting Indigenous Australians. The two groups performed together on numerous occasions and were instrumental in raising awareness about the struggles faced by Indigenous communities. Over their two decades of existence, the Warumpi Band left a lasting mark on the Australian music industry. Their unique sound, passionate performances, and tireless advocacy for Aboriginal rights inspired many musicians and listeners alike.

Summarize: Houthi rebel artillery pounded residential areas near the city of Taiz, witnesses said. However, the capital Sanaa and central Yemen are understood to be quiet. Before the truce was due to begin, clashes were reported at a major air base north of Aden after government allies took the  nearby town of Sabr. The Saudi-led coalition said it would halt air raids at midnight (20:59 GMT) to let much-needed humanitarian aid in. But a Houthi spokesman said the rebels would not adopt a position on the move until they were officially informed. Earlier reports suggested that the Houthi leader, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, had pledged to continue the fight. A correspondent with AFP news agency also reported sporadic gunfire in the northern outskirts of Aden barely an hour after the unilateral truce came into force. Rebels there are trying to halt the advance of loyalist forces who have retaken the port city. On Saturday, the coalition said it would suspend bombardment for five days but that it reserved the right to respond to \\"military activity or movement\\" by Houthi rebels. The unexpected ceasefire was announced after Yemen's President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi wrote to Saudi's King Salman asking for a break, to allow humanitarian supplies to be delivered. It came after strikes in Taiz province, which reportedly killed 120 people, including civilians. Aid agencies say a blockade on Yemen has worsened the humanitarian crisis which is gripping the country. More than 80% of Yemen's 25 million people now need some form of aid. The Saudi-led coalition has been bombing Houthi militia and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh since 26 March. The UN has warned the coalition that indiscriminate bombing of populated areas is against international law. A week-long truce brokered by the UN failed earlier this month. At least 1,693 civilians have been killed in fighting in Yemen, with almost 4,000 people wounded. The UN said the majority of casualties were caused by air strikes. Houthis - The Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels. Ali Abdullah Saleh - Military units loyal to the former president - forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests - are fighting alongside the Houthis. Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - The president fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Loyal soldiers, Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels. Saudi-led coalition - A US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states says it is seeking to \\"defend the legitimate government\\" of Mr Hadi. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi. A rival affiliate of Islamic State has also recently emerged.

However, a Houthi spokesman stated they will not adopt a position on the ceasefire until they are officially informed.

Question: Process:  - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more trucks take coal to the power station happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To examine the perturbation hypothesis and its effect on the coal mining process, let's break the scenario down step-by-step: 1. A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain. Increasing the number of trucks taking coal to the power station would not have an effect on this stage of the process. 2. Miners enter the mine. Similarly, increasing the number of trucks does not affect the entry of miners into the mine. 3. Miners remove the coal from the mine. At this stage, increasing the number of trucks could potentially affect the amount of coal removed from the mine indirectly if the mine is not able to meet the increased demand. However, it is more likely that the mining operation is producing coal at a consistent rate, and the increased number of trucks at power stations will not have an impact on the amount of coal removed. 4. The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt. Like step 3, increasing the number of trucks would not have an effect on this stage of the process, as the loading of coal into carts or conveyor belts is isolated from the transportation of coal to the power station. 5. The coal is moved up to the surface. The process of moving coal up to the surface is separate from the number of trucks transporting the coal to the power station and should not be affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 6. The coal is loaded onto a truck. If more trucks are taking coal to the power station, it will require faster loading of trucks at the mine site. This could affect the flow of coal from the mining operation to the power station if there is a bottleneck in the capacity to load trucks. In this case, less coal could potentially arrive at the power station due to delays. 7. The truck takes the coal to a power station. More trucks going to the power station might result in congestion or capacity issues at the power station itself. In this instance, less coal could reach and be unloaded at the power station, due to a higher volume of trucks causing delays in unloading, thus indirectly affecting the coal supply. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of more trucks taking coal to the power station could indirectly cause less coal to arrive. However, it would not affect the initial mining steps— excavating, entering the mine, removing coal, or moving the coal to the surface. The effects might only be seen in truck loading and unloading stages, as well as due to possible capacity and congestion issues at the power station."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Rawhead Rex Movie plot: Howard Hallenbeck (David Dukes) is an American professor who travels to Ireland to research items of religious significance. He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt.Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience apparently destroys O'Brien's sanity. Afterwards, Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them.Later, a man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a clearly traumatized Jenny. The police arrive at the scene and investigate. Meanwhile, Rawhead drags Dennis' dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park. A teenager named Andy Johnson is trying to make out with his girlfriend. The two teens head into the woods. Soon after, Howard sees Rawhead on top of a distant hill with Andy's head in his hand.Afterwards, Howard speaks again with Coot, who tells him the church's parish records have been stolen. Declan O'Brien destroys his camera. He takes his family on the road again.On the road, Howard's daughter needs to go to the bathroom, so Howard pulls over and lets her go by a tree. Hearing her suddenly scream, Howard and his wife rush to her; Howard's son stays in the van, alone. Rawhead kills Howard's son and takes the body into the woods. Infuriated by the police's unsuccessful efforts to track down Rawhead, Howard returns to the church.

To do this, I need to understand the meaning of the sentence and find the appropriate words in Arabic that convey the same meaning. Here is a step-by-step explanation of my translation: 1. The original Farsi sentence is: ما از نقاشی ناخودآگاه (doodle) و طراحی شروع می کنیم. 2. The sentence can be understood as: \\"We start from unconscious painting (doodle) and designing.\\" 3. To translate this sentence into Arabic, we can use the following corresponding words:    - ما (We) -> نحن    - از (from) -> من    - نقاشی ناخودآگاه (unconscious painting) -> الرسم العفوي       * نقاشی (painting) -> الرسم       * ناخودآگاه (unconscious) -> العفوي    - (doodle) -> (doodle) The word \\"doodle\\" can be retained as it is because it is an English term commonly used in many languages.    - و (and) -> و    - طراحی (designing) -> التصميم    - شروع می کنیم (we start) -> نبدأ 4. Combining the Arabic words, the translated sentence is: نحن من الرسم العفوي (doodle) والتصميم نبدأ 5.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Place your Developer and Blix containers in a sink or a bathtub with water that is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. Use your thermometer to monitor the temperature of the water. Place your development tank in clean tap water that is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius, and pour same temperature water into the tank (without opening it) to pre-soak your film before developer. With your agitator, agitate the tank for one minute while it is soaking. After one minute dump the water out. It is OK if the water is colored. Make sure any excess water is removed from the tank. Use a thermometer to ensure that your Developer is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. With a stopwatch in hand, pour the Developer into the tank until it is level with the opening at the lid. Start the stopwatch as soon as you've poured all the Developer into the tank. Agitate the tank for 15 seconds.  Do this by swirling the tank around. Flip the tank gently 4 times every 30 seconds. Tap the tank gently on the edge of the sink to pop any bubbles that have formed inside from flipping it. Repeat this every 30 seconds for 3 minutes exactly. At 3:25, start pouring the Developer back into its original chemical container or jug using the funnel. Your developing time will be 3 ½ minutes. Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank. The developing chemicals become exhausted very shortly after coming in contact with the film. The agitation ensures that fresh chemicals are touching the film. Ensure with your thermometer that the Blixer is at the right temperature. Pour the Blix mix into the tank until it is level with the opening at the lid, and start your timer. Agitate for 15 seconds then cover. Flip the tank four times, but you do not need to tap it this time! Flip the tank 4 times every 30 seconds for 6 minutes. At 6:25, pour the Blix back into its original chemical container or gallon jug using the funnel. You will need to wash the film after you pour out the Blix. Fill the tank with tap water that is 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 to 40.5 degrees Celsius. Agitate it again for a couple seconds and leave it soaking for 3 minutes. Fill up your tank with the Stabilizer until it is level with the opening at the lid. Agitate for 15 seconds, and leave it for 1 minute. After one minute, pour the Stabilizer back into its container using the funnel. If you like, you can do a quick rinse after the Stabilizer. Pour water into the tank, shake it gently, and pour the water back out. This is to ensure that excess chemicals have been removed form the tank.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, we need to break down the process and the perturbation hypothesis step-by-step and examine if there is any interaction or connection between the two. Process: 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals. 5. A fossil is formed. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose a person is on a diet. Now, we will analyze each step of the process in relation to the perturbation hypothesis. 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: A person's diet does not have any direct effect on animals and plants dying in soft soil or mud. However, there might be an indirect effect if, for example, the person's diet leads to less demand for certain animal products, resulting in fewer animals being raised and potentially dying in soft soil or mud. This connection is likely minimal and does not significantly affect the overall process. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: A person's diet does not have any effect on sediment build-up. This process is independent and is influenced by factors like the natural weathering of rocks and the deposition of particulate matter. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: A person's diet does not have any effect on the decomposition of remains. This process involves the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms and other natural processes. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: A person's diet does not have any impact on this step as it is a natural process involving the infiltration of minerals into the remaining parts of the remains. 5. A fossil is formed: A person's diet does not influence the final formation of a fossil. The process of fossilization is dependent on the factors mentioned in the previous steps. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a person being on a diet has no direct effect on the process of fossil formation. Any indirect effects would likely be minimal and not significantly impact the overall process. The connection between the person's diet and more animals dying on muddy soil is tenuous and does not substantiate the perturbation hypothesis."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: While your pet fish may appear to be ignorant of your presence, chances are that it knows you extremely well and can probably even identify you from a crowd of human faces! At least, that is the conclusion reached by scientists the University of Oxford in the U.K. and the University of Queensland in Australia, following an extensive study of the archerfish  , a species of tropical fish that can be found all the way from India to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. The ability to distinguish between human faces is a complex task. That's because we all have the same basic features -- two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. It's only the subtle differences that make humans distinct from one another. Since this requires a combination of both visual sense and memory, researchers had always assumed that _ was a skill possessed only by those with complicated brains, i.e., humans, a few select animals -- such as horses, cows, dogs, monkeys and some birds, like pigeons. To test if this assumption was accurate, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cait Newport, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, decided to study fish. The aquatic   animals have small brains that lack the neocortex , or neocortex-like structure, believed to help recognize the subtle differences between human facial features. The team began by presenting four archerfish with images of two human faces. Initially, the fish spat randomly at both. However, they soon learned that pouring water at the one selected by the researchers earned them a food treat. After that, they focused primarily on that image. The researchers then took the experiment one step further, by introducing 44 other human faces to the mix. To the researcher's astonishment, the trained archerfish were able to recall the learned image almost 81% of the time. And this accuracy improved to 86% when the researchers made the identification even harder, by replacing the colored photos with a set of black and white images and hiding the shape of the head. Question: In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish   _  . Options: A: by taking photos of fish B: by improving people's images C: by rewarding them with food D: by covering their heads","output":"In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish by rewarding them with food. The correct answer is C: by rewarding them with food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use the following highlights to write an article: Fabian Delph is suspended for three games after losing appeal. Delph will miss Palace and Leicester plus FA Cup clash with Blackpool. Kieran Richardson and Gabby Agbonlahor also sent off in recent weeks. Article:","output":"Title: Fabian Delph Faces Three-Game Suspension Following Failed Appeal  Leicester City midfielder Fabian Delph is set to serve a three-game ban after his recent appeal against a red card, given during his team's 2-1 loss to Manchester City, was rejected by the Football Association. Delph’s suspension means he will miss crucial games against Crystal Palace and Leicester City, along with an FA Cup clash with Blackpool. The 31-year-old English international was shown a straight red card after a reckless challenge on Manchester City’s Phil Foden in the 37th minute of the game, which saw him receiving his marching orders from referee Chris Kavanagh. Delph contested the dismissal, arguing that it was a harsh decision, but the FA upheld the referee's call and imposed the suspension, adding to Leicester City's growing disciplinary issues. This marks the third consecutive red card for the Foxes in as many weeks, following the dismissals of Kieran Richardson and Gabby Agbonlahor. Their absence has raised questions about the team's discipline and commitment, as they struggle to maintain a consistent form in the Premier League. _A Growing Concern for Leicester City_ Delph’s suspension comes as a significant blow for Brendan Rodgers and his squad, whose recent lack of discipline has led to the mounting pressure on the team. Despite the occasional flashes of brilliance from their young guns, Delph’s leadership qualities and top-flight experience are crucial for the Foxes at this stage of the season. As Delph will miss Leicester’s upcoming fixtures against Crystal Palace and former Premier League champions Leicester City, the team will need to rely on its depth and character to maintain momentum in the league. The FA Cup clash against Blackpool will also see Delph a no-show, depriving Rodgers’ options of a key player who could make a difference in the knockout stages. With Richardson and Agbonlahor also serving bans, the Foxes will have to dig deep into their squad to find suitable replacements. Youth academy products Hamza Choudhury, Harvey Barnes, and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall may get the nod for a starting berth, demonstrating the faith placed in the team's youth development program. _Time for Leicester City to Rally_ With a growing list of disciplinary and injury concerns, Brendan Rodgers and Leicester City must work to find a way to keep their season on track. The upcoming games will test the Foxes' resolve, squad unity, and management skills, but will also present an opportunity for younger players to step up and make an impact. The team's ability to respond to adversity is critical, as they aim to keep their Premier League season on course and challenge in the FA Cup. It is now up to the club’s remaining players to showcase their resilience and determination in the wake of suspensions and other obstacles they face on their journey towards the end of the season. In conclusion, Delph's suspension, along with those of Richardson and Agbonlahor, emphasizes the need for greater discipline within Leicester City's ranks. Amidst the setbacks, the opportunity for a potential breakthrough performance from the younger generation could be the silver lining that Leicester City fans have been waiting for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From Easy Street (1917) to Modern Times (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He is best known for his character \\"the little tramp  \\". It is this kind-hearted character that we connect with the time of silent movies.      Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914, Chaplin made his first short film, Making a Living. That same year, he made thirty-four more short films. These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was extremely good at it.     Chaplin was known as one of the most demanding men in Hollywood. No matter how big or tiny the size of the part, Chaplin walked each actor through every scene. Chaplin knew that a successful scene wasn't simply about the star, but about everyone on the screen. He required that all the actors and actresses work together in every performance. The only way to achieve it was to keep complete control over every scene. As he became more popular, he used more and more creative and difficult filming techniques. Movies such as his 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, required endless reworking of scenes and rebuilding of sets.      Though Chaplin is of the silent movie era, his achievements were carried over into the films of today. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new and more wonderful cinema. Chaplin's working life in entertainment lasted over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88. Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  . Options: A: Charlie Chaplin went to America for the first time at 20 B: Charlie Chaplin made 35 short films in total in 1914 C: short films had many kinds of comedy besides physical comedy D: Charlie Chaplin didn't make any popular movies after 1936 Answer:","output":"B: Charlie Chaplin made 35 short films in total in 1914"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is the breakdown of the differences between the two statements: 1. Roles of Ed Curtis and Nick Winston: In the first sentence, Ed Curtis is mentioned as the director of the show, and Nick Winston is stated as the choreographer: \\"The show was premiered at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle on March 27, 2012, directed by Ed Curtis and choreographed by Nick Winston.\\" However, in the second sentence, their roles are switched; Nick Winston is described as the one staging the show, while Ed Curtis is mentioned as the choreographer: \\"The show was staged by Nick Winston on 27 March 2012 at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle and choreographed by Ed Curtis.\\" 2.

Allen plays Leonard Zelig, a nondescript enigma, who, out of his desire to fit in and be liked, takes on the characteristics of strong personalities around him. The film, presented as a documentary, recounts his intense period of celebrity in the 1920s and includes analyses from contemporary intellectuals. Zelig was photographed and narrated in the style of 1920s black-and-white newsreels, which are interwoven with archival footage from the era and re-enactments of real historical events. Allen used newsreel footage and inserted himself and other actors into the footage using bluescreen technology. To provide an authentic look to his scenes, Allen and cinematographer Gordon Willis used a variety of techniques, including locating some of the antique film cameras and lenses used during the eras depicted in the film, and even going so far as to simulate damage, such as crinkles and scratches, on the negatives to make the finished product look more like vintage footage. The virtually seamless blending of old and new footage was achieved almost a decade before digital filmmaking technology made such techniques in films like Forrest Gump (1994) and various television advertisements much easier to accomplish.  The film uses cameo appearances by real figures from academia and other fields for comic effect. Contrasting the film's vintage black-and-white film footage, these persons appear in color segments as themselves, commenting in the present day on the Zelig phenomenon as if it really happened. They include essayist Susan Sontag, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, political writer Irving Howe, historian John Morton Blum, and the Paris nightclub owner Bricktop.  Also appearing in the film's vintage footage are Charles Lindbergh, Al Capone, Clara Bow, William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, Charlie Chaplin, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Carole Lombard, Dolores del Rio, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goring, James Cagney, Jimmy Walker, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Adolphe Menjou, Claire Windsor, Tom Mix, Marie Dressler, Bobby Jones, and Pope Pius XI.  In the time it took to complete the film's special effects, Allen filmed A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and Broadway Danny Rose. Are any parts of the movie in color?","output":"Yes, parts of the movie \\"Zelig\\" are indeed in color. Contrasting with the predominant vintage black-and-white aesthetic, there are contemporary segments of the film presented in color. These sections feature real figures from various professional fields, who appear as themselves in what could be called 'modern-day' scenes, commenting on the happenings of the Leonard Zelig phenomenon as if it really occurred. These individuals include prominent personalities such as essayist Susan Sontag, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, political writer Irving Howe, historian John Morton Blum, and Paris nightclub owner Bricktop. These scenes of color are somewhat of a stylistic decision by Woody Allen, they offer a notable contrast to the monochromatic vintage footage, providing the audience with a clear distinction between the present (at the time of making the film) and the past as depicted in the black-and-white sections. It's interesting to mention that beyond this use of color footage for present-day commentary, the film is phenomenal in its commitment to historical re-creation, blending vintage footage with new scenes shot (and tweaked) to look old. This attention to stylistic detail extends to the point of simulating defects on the negatives, as if the footage was vintage, hence contributing to the overall authenticity and believability of the narrative, making the color sections stand out even more prominently due to the stark contrast in visual tone. These color scenes serve as a tool for narrative bridging, giving insights and interpretations that link the past and the present, enabling the audience to better comprehend the significance of Zelig's story, not just as a character study, but also as a reflection of society's complex dynamics. They provide a rich context to understand the mockumentary style storytelling adopted by Allen in this film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the Strategic Air Command 843rd Bomb Wing, equipped with B-52 bombers and nuclear bombs. The 843rd is currently in-flight on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside Russia.     General Ripper explains to Group Captain Mandrake how he first discovered the Communist plot to pollute Americans' \\"precious bodily fluids.\\" General Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) of the UK Royal Air Force, to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues \\"Wing Attack Plan R\\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \\"King\\" Kong (Slim Pickens). All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia and set their radios to allow communications only through the CRM 114 discriminator, which is programmed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of United States water supplies to pollute the \\"precious bodily fluids\\" of Americans; Mandrake now realizes that Ripper is insane. At the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and other officers and aides about the attack in the \\"War Room\\". President Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, but Turgidson reminds him that Plan R, enabling a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on Washington, DC, allows such an action.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A.

Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules.

Given the question: As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal   element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable.

Summarize this article: A Moscow court convicted Mr Poteyev in absentia of treason and desertion, sentencing him to 25 years in jail. He left Russia shortly before the sleeper agents were arrested a year ago and he is now believed to be in the United States. The agents were expelled from the US last year. The military court said Poteyev had overseen the Russian agents in the US as a deputy head of the \\"S\\" department of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. Vladimir Kharitonov, the prosecutor in the case, said he was satisfied with the verdict. \\"By the court's ruling he is stripped of his military rank and all state decorations.\\" The 10 sleeper agents were expelled by the US last July and exchanged for four Russians who allegedly spied for the West. It was the biggest spy swap since the Cold War. On their return, the Russian sleepers were met by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and given Russia's top honours by President Dmitry Medvedev. They included Anna Chapman, who has since become a media sensation in Russia, hosting her own television show. Ms Chapman testified that she was caught after an undercover American agent contacted her using a code that only Poteyev and her personal handler knew. She said she immediately felt that something was wrong and called her handler in Moscow who confirmed her suspicions. Ms Chapman and the others were arrested shortly afterwards.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you harvest the leaves off of a Yucca plant?","output":"To harvest leaves from a Yucca plant, it is important to consider several factors to ensure that the plant is not harmed or damaged. Both the following solutions offer safe and efficient methods, and by examining their advantages and drawbacks, we can determine the better option: Solution 1: Manual harvesting with a sharp knife and gloves 1. Advantages:    a. No need for specialized equipment; only a sharp knife and gloves are required.    b. Direct control over the process, ensuring minimal damage to the rest of the plant.    c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations.    d. Environmentally friendly as no power tools are used. 2. Drawbacks:    a. Time-consuming, especially for larger Yucca plants or multiple harvests.    b. Physically demanding as it requires precise cutting and potential bending or reaching.    c. Risk of injury if proper care is not taken with the sharp knife. Solution 2: Using specialized hand pruners or shears 1. Advantages:    a. Designed specifically for cutting leaves or stems, providing a clean and accurate cut.    b. Less physically demanding as the pruners/shears provide leverage for the cutting process.    c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations.    d. Faster process compared to using a simple knife. 2. Drawbacks:    a. Cost of purchasing specialized hand pruners or shears.    b. Potential for causing damage to the plant if not used correctly or if pruners/shears are dull.    c. Still requires manual labour and time investment, although typically less than with a knife. Both solutions can effectively harvest leaves off a Yucca plant. However, the better solution should address the key concerns of efficiency, ease of use, and minimal damage to the plant. Based on the advantages and drawbacks, Solution 2 (using specialized hand pruners or shears) emerges as the better option. Using specialized hand pruners or shears offers a faster and less physically demanding process compared to manually cutting the leaves with a knife. This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with multiple plants or larger specimens. The specialized pruners/shears are designed specifically for this type of task and provide clean and accurate cuts, further minimizing the risk of causing unnecessary harm to the plant. While Solution 2 does involve some investment in purchasing the right tools, this cost is typically justified by the improved harvesting process and higher overall efficacy. However, it is crucial to ensure that the pruners or shears are well-maintained and used correctly and that the users are familiar with the proper techniques to minimize damage to the Yucca plant while harvesting its leaves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stick each pair of suction cups on either side of the granite seam.\\"","output":"The Art of Granite Installation: Seamlessly Uniting Two Pieces for a Sleek Finish Granite countertops are renowned for their durability, aesthetic appeal, and easy maintenance. Natural stones like granite are known for their unique appearance, making them a popular and sought-after choice for kitchens and bathrooms. The beauty of these stones lies not only in their individual patterns and hues but also in how well they are installed, leaving a seamless connection between the pieces. The process requires precision, patience, and skillful techniques. In this article, we will explore one such technique that professionals use to achieve a beautifully joined granite seam: connecting two granite pieces using turnbuckles and suction cups. # Before You Begin Carefully plan and prepare for the granite installation. It is wise to entrust the task to skilled professionals as it involves precise measurements and handling of heavy materials. Granite countertops are custom made, ensuring that they match perfectly with the existing room dimensions and the desired design. Consult with your granite fabricator for expert guidance, who will take detailed measurements before procuring the granite. # Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting Two Granite Pieces using Turnbuckles and Suction Cups Follow these steps to seamlessly unite two pieces of granite for polished and well-connected countertops: 1. **Prepare the workspace**: Clean the area where the granite countertops will be installed, ensuring that there is no dirt or debris that might hinder the installation process. It is necessary to have a flat and stable surface, such as plywood, for the granite to rest upon. 2. **Clean the granite**: Use a lint-free cloth and stone cleaner to remove any dust or dirt from the granite pieces. This ensures that the suction cups stick securely to the granite surfaces and promotes proper adherence of the epoxy during installation. 3. **Position the granite pieces**: Neatly lay the two pieces of granite side-by-side, aligning the edges to make sure they match perfectly. Pay attention to the seam, ensuring that it appears straight and follows the flow of the granite pattern. 4. **Thread turnbuckles through suction cups**: Prepare 2-3 pairs of suction cups with attached turnbuckles (metal devices used for tightening or loosening ropes). Turnbuckles usually consist of a threaded loop attached to two hooks. Thread the turnbuckles through the suction cups so that they can be used to hold and adjust the granite pieces during the seam connection process. 5. **Attach suction cups to granite**: Stick one of each suction cup pair on either side of the granite seam, directly opposite each other. Ensure that the turnbuckles are properly connected so that they can pull the granite pieces together. 6. **Apply epoxy**: Apply a color-matched epoxy along the seam to connect the two granite pieces. Ensure that the epoxy completely fills the seam, starting from the center and working your way outward. The epoxy should match the color and pattern of your granite, creating a seamless appearance when cured. 7. **Tighten the turnbuckles**: Use the turnbuckles to pull the granite pieces together, tightening the seam and allowing the epoxy to settle properly. Adjust the turnbuckles to ensure that the granite surfaces are flush with each other. 8. **Remove excess epoxy**: Once the epoxy is sufficiently cured, remove any excess using a razor blade or putty knife. Be careful not to create any scratches or marks on the granite surface. 9. **Perform a final inspection**: Inspect the seam to ensure that it is smooth, flush, and matches your granite's original pattern. Check the surrounding areas as well, making sure that no damage has occurred during the installation process. 10. **Seal the granite**: Apply a high-quality stone sealer to the granite countertop, following the manufacturer's instructions. This step helps protect the granite from stains and ensures the longevity of your beautiful countertop. In conclusion, uniting two pieces of granite using turnbuckles and suction cups is an effective, professional technique to attain a sleek, seamless finish for your granite countertops. With careful planning, measurement, and execution, you can achieve a beautifully connected granite surface that will stand the test of time and add style and value to your home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Explanation: The premise states that the Administrator is responsible for allocating allowances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, subject to the provisions of section 417. The provisions mentioned in section 417 are not defined in the given context, but it can be assumed that these provisions give guiding principles, limitations, or conditions for the allocation of allowances. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts that the Administrator has no power to allocate allowances. This hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly outlines the Administrator's responsibility in allocating allowances, albeit subject to certain provisions. The presence of section 417 provisions does not negate the Administrator's power to allocate allowances; it just implies that the power must be exercised according to the specified provisions. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While both statements address the role of the Administrator in allocating allowances, the premise assigns this role to the Administrator with certain conditions, while the hypothesis denies the Administrator's authority altogether.

Plot title: The Negotiator Movie plot: Lieutenant Danny Roman (Jackson) is a top police hostage negotiator. When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

Why do some VPN tunnels go down when they don’t see traffic for a while? What is the danger of doing P2P while VPN is on? Available options:  (1). no;  (2). yes; The answer is:","output":"(1). No; The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of VPN usage. Let's take a closer look at the two questions to understand the differences between them. 1. Why do some VPN tunnels go down when they don’t see traffic for a while? This question is about the behavior of VPN tunnels in regards to traffic flow. VPN tunnels provide a secure and private channel for data transfer between your device and a remote server by encrypting and encapsulating data. In some cases, when there is no traffic or data transfer happening for a certain period of time, the VPN tunnel may go down. This can happen due to various reasons: - Timeout settings: Many VPNs have a timeout setting or control inactivity period, during which they wait for the next data packet. If a packet is not received within this time, the VPN tunnel might be disconnected for security reasons or to save resources. - Network instability: If the internet connection is unstable, it might cause the VPN tunnel to go down every once in a while. - VPN server maintenance or reboots: Sometimes, servers need to undergo maintenance, updates or reboots, which can momentarily affect VPN tunnels connected to them. 2. What is the danger of doing P2P while VPN is on? This question addresses the potential risks associated with using peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks while connected to a VPN. P2P networks allow users to share and download files directly from others, without the need for a central server. However, these networks can pose several risks, especially when users share copyrighted or illegal content. Using a VPN while engaging in P2P file sharing can help protect your privacy and anonymity by masking your IP address, making it harder for other users or authorities to identify or track your activities. However, there still are some dangers: - VPN reliability: If the VPN connection drops while connected to a P2P network, your real IP address could be exposed, which could lead to possible legal consequences or surveillance by third parties. - Logs and privacy policies: Some VPN services may keep logs or have weak privacy policies, which can leave traces of your P2P activities. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to choose a reliable VPN with a strict no-log policy. - Malware and cyberthreats: P2P networks are known for being an easy target for cybercriminals to distribute malware among unsuspecting users. Using a VPN can mask your IP address, but it does not provide protection against downloading malicious files. In conclusion, both questions touch on different aspects of VPN usage. The first question deals with VPN tunnel stability and possible causes of disconnection. The second question discusses the potential risks associated with P2P file sharing while using a VPN. Therefore, the answer is (1). No, the questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"The wife, or okugatasama (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend the home forcibly.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did samurai wives' duties include when their husbands were away?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The wife, or okugatasama (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend the home forcibly.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What did samurai wives' duties include when their husbands were away?\\" However, it would be more helpful to provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to properly address the question. In feudal Japan, samurai wives, or okugatasama, had several important duties and responsibilities while their husbands were away. These duties can be broadly categorized into household management, child rearing, and defending the home, as mentioned in the given sentence. Here is a more detailed breakdown of their roles: 1. Household management: Samurai wives were expected to manage the day-to-day affairs of the household. This included overseeing the servants, maintaining the finances, and ensuring that everything ran smoothly in their spouse's absence. They were highly skilled in various domestic tasks and often played a crucial role in maintaining the family's social standing by hosting and entertaining guests of the samurai household. Furthermore, they were responsible for managing the family's resources, including land and property, as well as organizing agricultural activities. 2. Child rearing and education: The okugatasama played a vital role in nurturing their children, both physically and mentally. They provided primary care and support, overseeing their children's health and overall well-being. In addition, they played an important role in the education of their children, passing on important moral and cultural values. Especially for daughters, the mother was responsible for teaching essential skills a woman needed for her future role as a samurai wife, such as etiquette, household management, manners, and appropriate behavior. They also needed to ensure that their sons received the necessary martial arts and military education to become successful samurai in their adult years. 3. Defending the home: It is essential to mention that, in some cases, samurai wives were responsible for defending the home when their husbands were away. They were often trained in martial arts, including the use of the naginata (a long pole weapon with a curved blade) and archery, to protect their homes and families against possible threats. The wives had to be prepared to fight, support their fellow samurai's spouses, and show courage in times of conflict or danger. In cases where the husband fell in battle or was incapacitated, the responsibility of heading the household could also fall upon the samurai wife. In conclusion, the sentence given does provide a valid answer to the question about the duties of samurai wives when their husbands were away. However, it only offers a brief overview of the various essential roles and responsibilities a samurai wife had to undertake in her husband's absence, which included household management, child-rearing, and home defense. These wives were trained, skilled, and resilient, playing an important role in maintaining the social and economic stability of the samurai household."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The data provided pertains to a comprehensive list and specific information related to the monsters and creatures found in the popular role-playing game (RPG), Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), specifically between the years 1977 and 1999. Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop RPG that allows players to create their own characters, embark on adventures, and engage in battles within a fantasy world. The game masters (also known as Dungeon Masters or DMs) are responsible for controlling and describing the world, providing challenges, and managing the story, which often includes a menagerie of monsters and creatures. The provided data specifically refers to Elemental creatures, which are a particular type of monster in the D&D universe. These creatures originate from the elemental planes, which are the foundational building blocks of the universe. Elementals can be comprised of many forms, most commonly embodying either earth, air, fire, or water. Some elementals can also arise from more obscure elements or combinations thereof. Elemental creatures can possess varying strengths and abilities depending on their elemental affinity. Within the detailed data, the mention of 'D&D Expert Rules (1981)' and 'D&D Expert Rules (1983)' hints at the appearance of Elemental creatures within these two rulebooks. It is likely that the authors of these rulebooks laid out essential guidelines on how to incorporate Elemental creatures into the game, such as their unique abilities, hit points, and game statistics. This information enables game masters to present engaging challenges to players when they encounter Elementals during play. Furthermore, the data lists the 'Rules Cyclopedia (1991)' as another source containing Elemental creatures. The Rules Cyclopedia is a comprehensive compilation of the D&D Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master rules that were released during the game's early edition years, consolidating them into a single tome. It covers information on how to create characters, how to play the game, and what creatures players may encounter. The inclusion of Elemental creatures in this sourcebook confirms their importance within the D&D universe as iconic and easily recognizable adversaries players might face in their adventures. The data also classifies Elementals as 'CREATURE_(OTHER_PLANES)', a label that further emphasizes the creature's origin. The term 'OTHER_PLANES' refers to the various planes of existence that exist within the multiverse of D&D; in the context of Elemental creatures, this indicates their connection to the elemental planes from which they hail. This distinction sets Elementals apart from other monster types that emerge from different planes, each with unique traits and characteristics. Overall, the given data highlights a list of Dungeons & Dragons monsters from 1977 to 1999, with a particular focus on Elemental creatures. These creatures inhabit the otherworldly planes associated with the game's core elements and have appeared in various rulebooks and source materials throughout the game's history. They provide challenges and interesting game mechanics to players and game masters alike, solidifying their role as iconic inhabitants of the expansive D&D universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1: How do I determine the value of a 1985 silver dollar? Question 2: What is a silver dollar from 1921 worth? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"These two questions, although similar, are not asking the same thing. They both pertain to the valuation of a silver dollar, but the coins in question are from different years and may hold different values due to varying factors. I will address both questions separately to provide a clear understanding of each coin's value. Question 1: How do I determine the value of a 1985 silver dollar? To determine the value of a 1985 silver dollar, you should consider the following factors: 1. Mint location: Silver dollars may have been minted at different locations, which is usually denoted by a letter mintmark. The mintmark for Philadelphia is 'P', for Denver 'D', and for San Francisco 'S'. Coins minted in different locations may have different values. 2. Condition: The value of a coin often depends on its condition or grade. Uncirculated coins, meaning those that have not been in circulation, will usually be of higher value than circulated ones. The Sheldon Scale, which ranges from 1 (poor) to 70 (perfect mint condition), is commonly used to grade coins. 3. Rarity: A coin's rarity can also have a significant impact on its value. The mintage number or the number of coins produced can help to determine the rarity. 4. Metal composition: The metal content of the coin can also influence its worth. As of 1985, U.S. silver dollars were often made from a copper-nickel composition. However, some commemorative coins were produced with a higher silver content, which would increase their value. 5. Demand: Market demand for the coin and collectors' interest in the piece also play an essential role in determining its value. To get an accurate assessment of your 1985 silver dollar, you should consult price guides and online resources, or consult a professional coin dealer or appraiser. Question 2: What is a silver dollar from 1921 worth? The value of a 1921 silver dollar depends on the following factors: 1. Series: In 1921, there were two series of silver dollars: the Morgan Silver Dollar and the Peace Silver Dollar. The Peace Silver Dollar was only minted in high relief in that year, making it quite valuable. 2. Mint location: As mentioned previously, mintmarks indicating the coin's place of minting can influence its value. For the 1921 silver dollar, check for the mintmark 'P' for Philadelphia, 'D' for Denver, or 'S' for San Francisco. 3. Condition: The coin's state is crucial for its valuation, with higher grades corresponding to higher values. Look to the Sheldon Scale to grade your coin appropriately. 4. Rarity: The rarity of the coin will similarly impact its value. The number of coins minted and surviving examples are factors to consider when assessing rarity. 5. Metal composition: Both the Morgan Silver Dollar and the Peace Silver Dollar were composed of 90% silver and 10% copper, which will also contribute to their value. 6. Demand: As with the 1985 silver dollar, the market demand and collectors' interest can impact the coin's value. To determine the exact value of your 1921 silver dollar, consult price guides, online resources, or a professional coin dealer or appraiser."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ACTION1: Agreeing with my girlfriend's cousin and not her. This action involves interpersonal relationships. Though it may potentially lead to conflicts or misunderstandings, it's not inherently unethical as long as honesty and clear communication is maintained. The ethics of this action may vary greatly on context, such as the subject matter being agreed upon or the intentions behind agreeing. 2. ACTION2: Telling my wife and family I have accepted my fate and will not have any more chemo and that I want to travel instead. This action involves personal choice relating to health and end of life decisions. It is not unethical to decide on personal health choices, as long as this decision doesn't harm others. Communicating this choice openly to family is actually an ethical act, since it informs them of the individual's wishes. From the provided actions, it may appear that the second action could carry heavier emotional weight, but none of them are definitively less ethical than the other without additional context.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Trudeau to be questioned over reports of fundraisers offering privileged access Justin Trudeau will be questioned by Canada’s ethics watchdog over reports of political fundraisers that allegedly offered privileged access to the prime minister and his cabinet ministers for a price. The development marks the first time in a decade that the ethics commissioner has questioned a sitting prime minister and is a turning point for Trudeau who swept to a majority government last year on broad promises to run a transparent administration that would abide by the highest standards of ethics. The scandal began brewing in October, after a series of media reports documented Liberal party fundraisers being held in the homes of wealthy Canadians and which offered access to members of Trudeau’s government for up to C1,500 (1,100) a ticket. The reports raised questions of whether the government was opening itself up to behind-the-scenes lobbying, such as a report by the Globe and Mail that quoted a British Columbia multimillionaire who said he had urged the prime minister to allow Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development just as the government was reviewing a bid by a China-based company to purchase a majority stake in one of British Columbia’s largest chains of retirement homes. The allegations, which have left Trudeau and his government fending off daily accusations of wrongdoing, triggered complaints to the ethics commissioner from the opposition Conservatives and the New Democratic party. Responding to the complaint from the Conservatives, Mary Dawson, Canada’s ethics commissioner said in a letter on Thursday that while there is no evidence to date to suggest that Trudeau violated the country’s conflict of interest act, she would query Trudeau over his involvement with the fundraising events. A copy of the letter was provided to the Guardian. Addressed to interim Conservative leader, Rona Ambrose, the letter noted Dawson’s unease over the issue. “While the information provided in support of the allegations is not sufficient to cause me to initiate an examination under the act at this time, your letter and media articles leave me with concerns in relation to Mr Trudeau’s interactions with individuals involved with the canola export agreement, Wealth One Bank and Anbang Insurance Group,” Dawson wrote. No timeline was given as to when she would question Trudeau. A spokesperson for the ethics commissioner confirmed that Dawson is looking into the matter and noted that it is the usual practice of the commissioner to follow up with questioning when the office receives a letter containing allegations. Based on the answers provided by the prime minister, the ethics commissioner will then determine whether a full-scale investigation should be launched. In late October, Canada’s lobbying commissioner announced it would launch an investigation into the fundraisers in order to determine whether any of the government rules around lobbying had been breached. The allegations of trading cash for access have come as a blow to Trudeau, as they appear to contradict accountability rules issued by the prime minister after his government came into power last year. The rules, which aim to go one step further than the fundraising rules that ban corporate and union donations and limit individual donations to a maximum of C1,500 annually, state “there should be no preferential access to government, or appearances of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organisations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties”. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trudeau said he would work with the ethics commissioner to answer any questions she may have. “We have very strict rules on fundraising at the federal level and no one is suggesting that we are not following those rules. And that’s something that is important for Canadians to remember,” he said. “Our commitment is to show the highest level of ethical standards, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” Earlier this week, Trudeau acknowledged that government business is discussed at the fundraisers – contrary to what officials from the Liberal party had previously told reporters – but insisted that donors have no special sway when it comes to government policy. Summary:","output":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be questioned by the country’s ethics commissioner in relation to allegations that political fundraisers for his Liberal party offered privileged access to Trudeau and cabinet ministers in return for payments of up to CAD1,500 (1,100). Trudeau is the first sitting prime minister to be questioned in this way for a decade. Trudeau, who came to power in 2015 promising transparency over ethics, now faces allegations over behind-the-scenes lobbying. In October, the lobbying commissioner announced an investigation into fundraisers, but the ethics commissioner has not yet decided to launch a full-scale investigation of her own."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, we ask you convert a data table of restaurant descriptions into fluent natural-sounding English sentences.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

Problem:Paragraph: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted Auwahi Wind Energy’s request to increase the number of allowed hoary bat deaths to 140 by 2037, The Maui News reported Friday. Auwahi Wind Energy submitted the amendments to the incidental take license and habitat conservation plan to federal and state agencies, officials said. The number is up from the 21 bats in its original permit received in 2012. The Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted the final environmental impact statement, the state department said. However, the federal decision must be published in the Federal Register to be made final. Auwahi was one of four Hawaii wind energy projects that applied for a federal permit, officials said. Its request was prepared and signed Sept. 3. The federal agency is expected to issue separate final decisions on each of the four requests through publication in the Federal Register, but the decisions have yet to be published. The risk that the wind turbines pose to bats in Hawaii “was largely unknown and underestimated,” Auwahi said in its original application. There is not enough information to determine the impact wind farms have on bat populations overall, experts confirmed. “We will certainly keep an eye on actual bat take numbers and oppose any additional increase in allowed take since there are known operational changes that would reduce the take to zero or close to it,” said Rob Weltman, president of the Sierra Club Maui Group. Auwahi experimented with changing turbine speeds, and fewer deaths at certain speeds were reported, Sierra Club officials said. Auwahi has worked to reforest bat habitat on Maui, sponsored U.S. Geological Survey bat research, conducted predator control and petrel burrow monitoring, and funded bat pens in the national park, the company said. American Electric Power acquired the west Maui wind farm from Sempra Renewables earlier this year, officials said. ___ Information from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com Claim: Hawaii wind farm allowed to increase incidental bat deaths.

Usage: Auwahi experimented with changing turbine speeds, and fewer deaths at certain speeds were reported, Sierra Club officials said. Explanation: Although there isn't a direct correlation to the claim about increasing the allowed bat deaths, this sentence shows that the company has tried to reduce the number of fatalities at certain turbine speeds, which indirectly supports the claim that it's trying to be environmentally responsible. Part #3: The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Usage: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources accepted Auwahi Wind Energy’s request to increase the number of allowed hoary bat deaths to 140 by 2037. These authorities approved the amendments to the incidental take license and habitat conservation plan despite the increase from 21 bats in its original permit. This development confirms the claim that the Hawaii wind farm is allowed to increase incidental bat deaths. Explanation: This response is made up of three sentences, meeting the minimum requirement of one and staying below the maximum of twelve sentences, while providing a concise explanation to support the claim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She opened presents and had cake.","output":"Today was indeed a special day for Iris; a milestone in her tender young life – she had turned five! Her mom, who reveled in these precious moments of her daughter's life, had meticulously planned a surprise birthday party for her. After weeks spent orchestrating the party with topmost secrecy and drafting a list of all of Iris's friends, the day had finally arrived. Iris woke up to the sweet aroma of pancakes wafting from the kitchen, her favorite. The first part of the day went by as usual, her mom being extra careful not to give the surprise away. Iris frolicked about, blissfully unaware of the epic soirée waiting for her later in the day. As the day wore on, her mom prepared to 'run some errands,' taking Iris to her grandmother's house. Little did Iris know, this was the perfect strategy to allow time for her mom and helpers to set up the house for the party. Iris's friends, already clued in, began to arrive one by one at the agreed time. Colorful streamers hung from the ceiling, balloons adorned every free corner, and the heavenly scent of freshly baked cake snaked its way around the house. An aura of excitement permeated the atmosphere as everyone waited for the guest of honor to arrive. Upon her return, the twinkle in Iris's eyes outshone her glittery birthday tiara, astonished to see the transformation her house had undergone. A chorus of \\"Happy Birthday\\" engulfed her as she stood awestruck at the doorway. Iris was in a paradise of her own, surrounded by her friends, family, and a pile of wrapped presents that were just waiting for her tiny hands to rip them open. Navigating through the crowd of hugs and birthday wishes, Iris finally made her way towards the mountain of gifts. Excitement bubbled within her as she tore apart the first wrapping paper, revealing a set of beautifully illustrated children's books. She smiled wide, her eyes sparkling with delight. Her friends looked on, their hearts filled with joy seeing Iris so happy. This excitement persisted through each gift. Stuffed animals, craft supplies, puzzles, dresses - each present was more exciting than the last.  But oh, the pièce de résistance of the evening was yet to come. Following the frenzy of presents, it was time for the birthday cake. Iris’s mother wheeled in a majestic princess cake, topped with five little candles. Iris's eyes were sparkling with anticipation, her hands eagerly twitching to cut the cake. She took a deep breath, blew the candles, and with a gleam in her eyes, she sliced the cake. Her friends echoed her giggles, their laughter filling the room as they indulged in the delicious cake. As night fell, the children left one by one, each carrying a small return gift, their faces beaming with joy. Iris, though tired, could not wipe the smile off her face. Her fifth birthday was indeed memorable, filled with love, surprises, and a room full of friends. As the excitement of the day dwindled down, Iris drifted off to sleep, her dreams filled with the day's events and the memories she had made. The house fell silent, yet echoing with the residual happiness, touched by the magical birthday party that her mom had so lovingly planned for Iris."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave.

Solve 34*j + 332 - 92 = 14*j for j.","output":"Let's start solving the equation step by step. The original equation is: 34*j + 332 - 92 = 14*j First, let's simplify the left side of the equation by combining the constants. Subtract 92 from 332 to get 240. The equation then becomes: 34*j + 240 = 14*j Now we need to get all the terms with 'j' on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side. We'd do this by subtracting 14*j from both sides of the equation. Subtracting 14*j from 34*j leaves us with: (34-14)*j + 240 = 0 or, 20*j + 240 = 0 Next, we solve for 'j' by subtracting the constant term from both sides: 20*j = -240 Lastly, to isolate 'j', we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'j', which is 20: j = -240 / 20 So, j = -12 So, the solution to the equation 34*j + 332 - 92 = 14*j is j = -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - West Point is the oldest continuously occupied military post in the United States. West Point was established in 1775 by George Washington who considered it the most important strategic position in America. Until January 1778, West Point was not occupied by the military. On January 27, 1778, Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and his brigade crossed the ice on the Hudson River and climbed to the plain on West Point and from that day to the present, West Point has been occupied by the United States Army. It comprises approximately including the campus of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which is also frequently called \\"West Point\\". It is a Census Designated Place (CDP) located in the Town of Highlands in Orange County, New York, located on the western bank of the Hudson River. The population was 6,763 at the 2010 census. It is part of the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.  - The high-water mark of the Confederacy refers to an area on Cemetery Ridge near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, marking the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863. Similar to a high water mark of water, the term is a reference to arguably the Confederate Army's best chance of achieving victory in the war. The line of advance was east of \\"The Angle\\" stone wall at various distances, e.g., the Virginians pushed the Union line back.  - Jeffry D. Wert (born May 8, 1946) is an American historian and author specializing in the American Civil War. He has written several books on the subject, which have been published in multiple languages and countries.  - Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \\"the captain of the men of death\\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \\"the old man's friend\\".  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson (January 21, 1824  May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War, and the best-known Confederate commander after General Robert E. Lee. His military career includes the Valley Campaign of 1862 and his service as a corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia, under Robert E. Lee. Confederate pickets accidentally shot him at the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863. The general survived but lost an arm to amputation; he died of complications from pneumonia eight days later. His death was a severe setback for the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the morale of its army and of the general public. Jackson in death became an icon of Southern heroism and commitment, and became a mainstay in the pantheon of the \\"Lost Cause\\".  - The Battle of Gettysburg (with an sound) was fought July 13, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's attempt to invade the North.  - The United States Military Academy ( USMA ) is an undergraduate college in West Point , New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army . Confederate President Jefferson Davis , himself a former officer and West Point graduate ( class of 1828 ) , preferred West Point trained officers for the Confederate States Army ( CSA ) . This article lists those alumni . Also included are a number of officers who were cadets at West Point but for reason unknown never graduated , such as Lewis Armistead . There are several ( indicated ) familiar relations between the officers , so we e.g. have several members of the Lee family of Virginia . Other notable Confederate officers include James Longstreet ( class of 1842 ) , Stonewall Jackson ( class of 1846 ) , and J.E.B. Stuart ( class of 1854 ) .  - The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War, and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville Campaign. It was fought from April 30 to May 6, 1863, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near the village of Chancellorsville. Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size, General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Chancellorsville is known as Lee's \\"perfect battle\\" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory. The victory, a product of Lee's audacity and Hooker's timid decision making, was tempered by heavy casualties and the mortal wounding of Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson by friendly fire, a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm.  - A field hospital is a small mobile medical unit, or mini hospital, that temporarily takes care of casualties on-site before they can be safely transported to more permanent hospital facilities. This term is used overwhelmingly with reference to military situations, but may also be used in times of disaster. The concept was inherited from the battlefield (such as the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital or MASH), and is now applied in case of disasters or major accidents, as well as with traditional Military medicine.  - Orange County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 372,813. The county seat is Goshen. This county was first created in 1683 and reorganized with its present boundaries in 1798.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.  - A brigade is a major tactical military formation that is typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements. It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. Two or more brigades may constitute a division.  - The Hudson River is a river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord, which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy.  - Col. Richard Lee I (16171664), later nicknamed \\"The Immigrant\\" was the first member of the Lee family to live in America; he emigrated from Shropshire, England to Virginia in 1639. Lee was a lawyer, planter, soldier, politician, and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.  - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range.  - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  - Pickett's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Union positions on Cemetery Ridge on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy.  - The President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807  October 12, 1870) was an American general known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until his surrender in 1865. The son of Revolutionary War officer Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the MexicanAmerican War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.  - Braxton Bragg (March 22, 1817  September 27, 1876) was a career United States Army officer, and then a general in the Confederate States Armya principal commander in the Western Theater of the American Civil War and later the military advisor to the Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.  - The Army of Tennessee was the principal Confederate army operating between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River during the American Civil War. It was formed in late 1862 and fought until the end of the war in 1865, participating in most of the significant battles in the Western Theater. It should not be confused with the Union Army of the Tennessee, named after the Tennessee River.  - Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is that of congenital amputation, a congenital disorder, where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. Unlike some non-mammalian animals (such as lizards that shed their tails, salamanders that can regrow many missing body parts, and hydras, flatworms, and starfish that can regrow entire bodies from small fragments), once removed, human extremities do not grow back, unlike portions of some organs, such as the liver. A transplant or a prosthesis are the only options for recovering the loss.  - The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary military force of the Confederate States of America in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War, as well as the primary command structure of the Department of Northern Virginia.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - James Longstreet (January 8, 1821January 2, 1904) was one of the foremost Confederate generals of the American Civil War and the principal subordinate to General Robert E. Lee, who called him his \\"Old War Horse.\\" He served under Lee as a corps commander for many of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, but also with Gen.

He took personal charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to defeat the more populous and industrialized Union. His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country, and at home, the collapsing Confederate economy forced his government to print more and more paper money to cover the war's expenses, leading to runaway inflation and devaluation of the Confederate dollar.  - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America.

In March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a more permanent Confederate States Army.  - Lewis Addison Armistead (February 18, 1817  July 5, 1863) was a career United States Army officer who became a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. On July 3, 1863, as part of Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead led his brigade to the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during the charge, a point now referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. However, he and his men were overwhelmed, and he was wounded and captured by Union troops; he died in a field hospital two days later.  - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico.

The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was \\"Join the Fight!\\" During the race, he was considered an underdog, as his opponent was 32 years his senior. He was reelected in 2000, defeating U.S. Congressman Ron Klink by a 52-46% margin. In his reelection bid of 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59-41% margin.  After his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to \\"practice what [he] preached\\" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid.  In 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill. In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican Arlen Specter in his short-lived campaign for president.

Ranking fifth among 50 senators in this regard, it is evident that Santorum played a crucial role in supporting fiscal conservatism during his time in office. 3. Influence on his party: Santorum's ability to serve as the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007 demonstrates his influence within the Republican Party. Additionally, his 2012 presidential campaign, in which he finished second to Mitt Romney, also shows the impact he made on the political landscape and within his party. 4. Advocacy on social issues: While serving in the Senate, Santorum was a prominent voice on socially conservative issues such as opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights. He used his platform to advocate for his views on these matters, which resonated with many conservative voters and shaped public discourse on these subjects.

Review: The CD was released shortly after Soraya's mother died after a long battle with breast cancer.

Article: Is it necessary for a young man to have an apartment as a prerequisite  for marriage? Housing has become a major obstacle  for Chinese young men hoping to start a family. China may breed a new group of bachelors, men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses. Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance  and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority  and that women see an apartment as essential  to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial  requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas. Social housing, provided by European authorities, offer the less wealthy people their own piece of real estate. Such housing is usually apartments in tall buildings with 10 or more floors on the _ of town, whose main advantage is the low rents. For many Americans, houses don't pose an obstacle to getting married. They often buy a house after the wedding, because more and more people are reconsidering their real estate worship, and going back to a more rational  mode of consumption. In Japan, renting is the custom for newly married young couples. Few young couples can afford to purchase property. Up to 67.1 percent of young couples choose to rent. Generally speaking, renters account for most... Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the text? Options: A: Home prices have been extremely high since early 2009.

Wiping the pieces of wood before joining them may remove some dust and debris on the wood surface. However, it will not change the wood fibers' condition in any way.  B).

Un Zorro souriant mais plutôt pervers . Cette histoire qui reprend le thème rebattu du vengeur masqué évoque naturellement de prime abord le personnage emblématique de Zorro : solitude du héros, cape et chapeau noir, voltiges à l'arme blanche, paraphes en lettres de feu...  Pour s'en démarquer, les scénaristes ont tenté d'instiller un peu d'inattendu dans l'intrigue et d'ambiguïté dans le manichéisme. Hélas ça donne en fait une sorte de galimatias sans queue ni tête, nourri d'allusions plutôt équivoques : D'un côté on découvre l'Angleterre soumise à un régime totalitaire exerçant sa pression policière au nom de périls imaginaires, mais dont le peuple s'accommode assez bien, accroché qu'il est à son confort matériel. L'église y est comme il se doit, pervertie et inféodée au Pouvoir, l'homosexualité, synonyme d'intelligence et d'ouverture d'esprit est persécutée, et le Coran constitue la relique émouvante d'une culture bannie. L'Amérique quant à elle est en pleine décomposition « à cause des guerres qu'elle a entreprises... »  De l'autre côté, on suit les péripéties d'un justicier censé incarner le bien mais dont les jugements sont à l'emporte pièce. Il n'hésite pas « pour la bonne cause », à tuer, brutaliser, terroriser, ou à faire sauter joyeusement les symboles même de la démocratie que sont le Parlement et le Palais de Justice en se servant du métro pour véhiculer ses bombes...  Au final le sentiment qui domine, c'est celui d'assister à une farce sinistre qui s'épuise en bavardages sentencieux et invraisemblances ridicules.

In 2017, York revealed that she had first felt \\"different\\" aged five, but was unaware that this difference came from discomfort with her gender.  She initially began riding for Glenmarnock Wheelers cycling club and quickly established herself as a leading amateur road racing rider. As Robert Millar, she was a relatively small man meaning she had comparatively less weight to carry uphill and she excelled as a specialist hill and mountain cyclist. She won the Scottish junior title in 1976 and was Scottish hill-climb champion the following year. In 1978, York established herself on the British scene. She was twenty-first in the Milk Race, and won the British amateur road race championship. She moved to France in 1979 to join the Athletic Club de Boulogne Billancourt (A.C.B.B.), one of Europe's top amateur teams. York was as ever focused and quickly began winning races such the Grand Prix de la Ville de Lillers. This success brought her the admiration of her A.C.B.B. manager Claude Escalon.  In 1979, after retaining her British road title, taking fourth place in the world amateur road championship, claiming five wins in France and winning the French 'Best Amateur' Trophy, she turned professional for the Peugeot cycling team, and as a climbing specialist focused on single-day road races and stage races in hilly or mountainous terrain.

In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which group tended to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers?  Concurrently with designing churches and building railways, Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering sanitary reform.  By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission.  He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a \\"chief magistrate\\". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor housing, open sewers, overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration.  Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including \\"cleansing, lighting and watching\\" the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers.  The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Why we won’t have tablet-native journalism Last week, when the Daily died, I declared that the reason, in part, was that tablet-native journalism was impossible. And I got a lot of rather vehement pushback, including some smart commentary from John Gruber, taking the other side of the argument. That most existing iPad magazine apps are slow, badly-designed, can’t search, etc. does not mean iPad magazine apps cannot be fast, well-designed, and searchable. Salmon says “This wasn’t The Daily’s fault” but he’s 180 degrees wrong. All of these problems were entirely The Daily’s fault. All impossible tasks have not been accomplished; but not all tasks that have not yet been accomplished are impossible. When it comes to media, what strikes many as The Daily’s cardinal sin is eschewing the open Web for the closed garden of a subscriber-only iOS app. The idea being that you can’t win without a web-first strategy. But that’s what “everyone” said about social networks too — until Instagram came along and became a sensation with an iPhone-only strategy. I’ve since talked about this issue at some length, with both David Jacobs of 29th Street Publishing — someone who specializes in developing iPad-native apps — and with Ben Jackson, another one of my critics. And I still think that tablet-native journalism is an idea which isn’t going to take off any time soon. Gruber’s point, which Jackson also made, is that you can’t tar an entire platform with a few bad apps. Maybe The Daily was bad; maybe lots of Condé Nast apps are bad; maybe the people selling ads on iPad apps are responsible for degrading the experience of using them so as to maximize ad revenues. But in theory, all of these problems can be overcome — and in fact, in practice, many of the problems I cited in my post have already been overcome, at least by one or two publishers. (For instance, the Businessweek app does have search, and the NYT app will let you start reading stories before the whole thing has downloaded.) Be that as it may be, however, no one’s been able to convince me that there even is such a thing as tablet-native journalism, let alone that it has any chance of really taking off. Certainly there’s lots of journalism which appears on tablets, and sometimes even exclusively on tablets. The Magazine, from Marco Arment, is the most cited, but one might also point to (what’s left of) Newsweek, where something called Newsweek Global “will be supported by paid subscription” and available on tablets. In both cases, however, the main reason for moving to the tablet seems to be revenue-related: it’s just vastly easier to charge for subscriptions on a tablet than it is on the web, and Newsweek needs to have a subscription product, to prevent itself from being forced to refund all the money it’s already been paid by print subscribers. And if The Magazine is really the best thing we’ve found so far in the tablet-journalism space, that’s pretty depressing. For one thing, there’s pretty much zero journalism in it; it’s mostly first-person essays by Marco’s friends. And then there’s the fact that it deliberately abjures all the clever things that the iPad can do, opting instead for a very clean and simple interface: what Craig Mod calls “subcompact publishing”. Subcompact publishing helps in terms of making great writing immersive: there are no distractions, just text (and maybe the occasional link or illustration) on a white background. Once you get lost in the story, the medium becomes invisible, just like all great storytellers should. It’s taking journalism and doing to it much the same thing that Readability does, or Apple’s “Reader” button in Safari. But when all you have is text, the journalism itself isn’t really tablet-native: it doesn’t shape itself to the contours of the medium in the way that radio journalism does to radio, or TV journalism does to TV, or tabloid-magazine journalism does to tabloid magazines. You’re basically left with a high-tech means of reading the kind of thing which could have been written centuries ago. But Jacobs makes a good point: if you look at these publications at the story level, you’re missing something very important. Jacobs has worked on apps for websites like Gothamist and the Awl, where the content in the app is exactly the same as the free content on the website, but the way that content is presented is different in important ways. Websites need to be fresh and constantly-updated; apps can be a bit more curated. And importantly what’s not there makes a big difference: one of the great things about The Magazine is that each issue is an easily-digestible length. Marco has a lot of information, from Instapaper, about the stories people like to read on their tablets, and specifically how long the sweet spot is. Each issue of The Magazine, or the Awl’s Weekend Companion, is much shorter than the daunting downloads one might get from The Daily or Wired or Businessweek. These smaller apps are not trying to present everything; they’re acting as real editors, and serving up something much more digestible. In the case of the Awl, the value (4 per month) is actually in the way that the editors have subtracted a huge amount of the content available on the website. Similarly, Matter publishes just one article at a time, and doesn’t even force you to use its own app: you can call it up online and then read it using Instapaper, if you like. So my feeling is that insofar as tablet journalism is going to have any success in the foreseeable future, you’re not going to see it in elaborate downloads with glossy production values. Jackson made this point: every time someone demonstrates ability in putting together great, intuitive iOS applications, they tend to be hired (or acqu-hired) very quickly by some big company like Facebook or Google. Radio journalists know how to edit radio shows, and TV producers can put together TV shows, but there are basically no journalists who can produce an iOS app to tell the stories they want to tell, and the coders they might conceivably work with, as part of a team, tend not to work for news-media organizations. Instead, we’re going to see universal journalism, which can be accessed — and possibly edited — in different ways on different devices. It might be free on the web, for instance, while costing a couple of bucks in the form of a simple iOS app. Maybe it will only be available on iOS, but for business-model reasons, not because it couldn’t work on the web. Or maybe, as in the case of Matter, it will be available in any format you like, for a single flat price. I’m quite excited about what Ev is doing at Medium, in terms of creating a new and intuitive way of writing online — it’s long past time that we managed to move away from the evil tyranny of Word. And then, once a Medium post has been created, it looks great on any device. That’s the future, I think: write once, look great anywhere. Rather than anything tablet-specific. Summary:","output":"This news article talks about why tablet-native journalism hasn't taken off. Some people argue it could be due to bad apps, slow downloads, or bad design.

Options: - store - office - cuba - photographs - pond  The answer is \\"pond\\" because A:","output":"Jellyfish can be found in various aquatic environments, including ponds, as well as oceans, seas, and even some freshwater bodies of water. While it's accurate to say you can find jellyfish in a pond, it's essential to provide further context and information to better understand this answer. Jellyfish are members of the phylum Cnidaria and class Scyphozoa, known for their bell-shaped body and gelatinous appearance. Typically, jellyfish reside in saltwater environments such as oceans and seas, where they can be found at various depths, from shallow coastal waters to deep ocean regions. This means finding jellyfish in Cuba's waters, a Caribbean Island, is highly plausible. However, you can also find jellyfish in freshwater and brackish environments, such as ponds. This is mostly applicable to a unique and rare species of jellyfish called Craspedacusta sowerbii or the freshwater jellyfish. The species is small, with a translucent appearance, and is native to China's Yangtze River Basin. Due to its invasive nature, it has spread to other parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Australia, where it has been found in ponds, reservoirs, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Although the given options include a store and an office, jellyfish are not naturally found in these environments unless they are held in an aquarium for educational or aesthetic purposes. As for photographs, one can find images of various jellyfish species within books, magazines, or online, it's not their natural habitat. In conclusion, the answer being \\"pond\\" is justified since some jellyfish species can be found in freshwater bodies of water like ponds. It's essential to note that the presence of jellyfish in a pond may vary depending on the region, species, and specific environmental conditions. Nevertheless, it's interesting to know that these fascinating creatures inhabit various aquatic environments, proving their adaptability and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

Please answer this question: In Christianity, ‘Holy Wednesday’ is also known as ‘what’ Wednesday?","output":"In Christianity, Holy Wednesday is also known as Spy Wednesday. This day, traditionally observed within the Holy Week, carries special significance in the Christian liturgy, as it commemorates the betrayal of Jesus Christ by one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot. The name 'Spy Wednesday' alludes to the act of espionage committed by Judas when he made a secret deal with the religious authorities to betray Jesus in exchange for 30 pieces of silver. Holy Week, in general, refers to the week preceding Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The week begins with Palm Sunday, followed by Holy Monday, Holy Tuesday, Spy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday (also known as Holy Thursday), Good Friday, and Holy Saturday, culminating in the joyous celebration of Easter Sunday. Spy Wednesday holds special significance because it serves as a reminder of human fallibility and the consequences of betrayal. In the biblical narrative, Judas' decision to betray Jesus set in motion a series of events that led to the crucifixion. These events are crucial to the Christian faith, as the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus form the cornerstone of Christianity, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice and triumph over sin and death. During Holy Week, many Christians attend special church services that commemorate and reflect on the events leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. On Spy Wednesday, services may focus on Judas Iscariot's betrayal and the role that his actions played in the unfolding of Jesus' Passion. In some Christian traditions, particularly those of Greek Orthodox and Eastern origin, Holy Wednesday is also known as Holy and Great Wednesday. In these traditions, the day is not characterized by the theme of betrayal and espionage but is rather marked by their focus on the healing power of Jesus' divine presence. The Orthodox Church emphasizes Jesus' act of forgiving the repentant woman who anoints his feet with oil and wipes them with her hair in preparation for his burial. This act, along with the sacrament of Holy Unction, commemorates Jesus' selfless and redemptive love and serves as a reminder of the healing available to all who seek it. In summary, Holy Wednesday in Christianity is also known as Spy Wednesday due to the betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas Iscariot. It is an important day within Holy Week as it symbolizes human fallibility and serves as a reminder of the consequences of betrayal. Christians around the world observe this day with solemn reflection and participate in services that highlight the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. In some traditions, the day commemorates Jesus' healing and forgiveness, emphasizing the divine and redemptive nature of his love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

See options at the end We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the  Options: (i) tomboy was inanimate.; (ii) plane was inanimate.;","output":"We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. While both the tomboy and the plane are interesting subjects, our focus in this particular story was to develop rich and multifaceted characters with personal struggles, aspirations, and growth. Since a tomboy is a human character, she can induce emotions and empathy in the audience, allowing for a more engaging story. Concentrating on a human character like the tomboy offers numerous benefits compared to highlighting an inanimate object like the plane. Firstly, human characters have emotions, thoughts, and different perspectives, enabling us to create a more diverse and intricate narrative. The tomboy's character arc can be shaped by her experiences and interactions with other characters in the story, providing opportunities for the complexities of human relationships to be explored. This would be difficult to accomplish if the central character were an inanimate object like the plane, as it lacks emotions and the ability to communicate through speech. Secondly, it is easier for readers to relate to and empathize with human characters. Audiences find it easier to become emotionally invested in a story when they can find aspects of their own lives mirrored in the characters. In the case of the tomboy, readers might identify with her struggles to find her identity, cope with societal expectations, or forge meaningful relationships with those around her. This emotional resonance might be lost if the plane were at the center of the story, as it would be more challenging to convey its significance to readers in a relatable manner. Furthermore, concentrating on the tomboy allows for a richer exploration of themes and messages. Human characters are capable of growth, change, and development over time, which encourages them to confront their flaws, learn from their mistakes, and persevere in the face of adversity. Such character arcs inspire readers and provoke thought about our own capacity for growth and transformation. But when we focus on an inanimate object like the plane, these themes of personal growth and resilience can become diluted or lost altogether. On the other hand, the plane could still play a vital role in the story. As a backdrop or plot device, the plane can contribute to the story's setting, create conflict for the characters, and shape the course of the narrative. For example, it could serve as a means of transportation for the tomboy on a life-changing journey, or as a potent symbol of her yearning for freedom and escape from societal pressures. In conclusion, we opted to write about the tomboy instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. It was crucial for our story to have a character that could engage the reader emotionally through relatable experiences and personal growth. The tomboy offered the depth and complexity that our narrative demanded, while the plane remained a valuable supporting element in the story. Overall, we believed this choice would create a more captivating and thought-provoking story for our audience to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you.

Summarize this article: The Labour leader said he was \\"appalled\\" that after offering him a right of reply, the paper had repeated its original article and also now \\"described my father's legacy as evil\\". He said it raised questions about morality and boundaries for newspapers. The Mail says it will not apologise and stands by the story. However, its deputy editor later said it was an \\"error of judgement\\" for the paper to have published a picture of Ralph Miliband's grave on the website version of the story, prompting the Labour leader to say the newspaper \\"should now apologise\\". In Saturday's article, journalist Geoffrey Levy questioned how the beliefs of Ralph Miliband, a Marxist academic who died in 1994, may have influenced the Labour leader and his brother, former Foreign Secretary David Miliband. It highlighted a diary entry Ralph Miliband wrote at the age of 17 saying that the English were \\"perhaps the most nationalist people in the world... you sometimes want them almost to lose [the war] to show them how things are\\". The paper goes on to say \\"how passionately he would have approved today of his son's sinister warning about some of the policies he plans to follow if he ever becomes prime minister\\". In his piece in Tuesday's edition, Ed Miliband says his father, a Jewish refugee who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis, \\"loved\\" Britain and served in the Navy. He says: \\"There is no credible argument in the article or evidence from [Ralph Miliband's] life which can remotely justify the lurid headline and its accompanying claim that it would 'disturb everyone who loves this country'.\\" He says Britain \\"was a source of hope and comfort for him, not hatred\\". \\"Fierce debate about politics does not justify character assassination of my father, questioning the patriotism of a man who risked his life for our country in the Second World War,\\" Mr Miliband says. He says the diary entry described the \\"suspicion he found of the Continent and the French when he arrived here\\". \\"To ignore his service and work in Britain and build an entire case about him hating our country on an adolescent diary entry is, of course, absurd.\\" Mr Miliband says his father joined the Navy as he \\"was determined to be part of the fight against the Nazis and to help his family hidden in Belgium. He was fighting for Britain.\\" He adds: \\"My father's strongly left-wing views are well known, as is the fact that I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision. \\"The idea of me being part of some 'sinister' Marxist plot would have amused him and disappointed him in equal measure and for the same reason - he would have known it was ludicrously untrue. I want to make capitalism work for working people, not destroy it.\\" Later, in an interview with reporters, Mr Miliband said it was \\"perfectly legitimate\\" for newspapers to discuss his father's politics. But he said: \\"I was appalled when I read the Daily Mail on Saturday and I saw them say he hated Britain. It's a lie.\\" The Daily Mail's editorial on Tuesday - published alongside Mr Miliband's response and an abridged version of the original article - is headlined \\"an evil legacy and why we won't apologise\\". Mr Miliband said: \\"I'm even more appalled that they repeated that lie today and they've gone further and described my father's legacy as evil. Evil is a word reserved for particular cases and I wasn't willing to let that stand.\\" He added that there were \\"boundaries\\" that newspapers should adhere to. \\"It's not about regulation... but it is about me saying I think morality and our approach to these things matters.\\" He added that his brother and mother felt the same way he did about what the newspaper had said. The Mail's editorial said it stood by \\"every word\\" of the article. \\"We do not maintain... that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different,\\" it said. It suggested that Mr Miliband's plans to freeze energy prices and give councils powers to purchase land from developers, and his support for press regulation backed by law, were signs of his \\"own Marxist values\\". It later said in a statement: \\"We ask fair-minded people to read our editorial today. For what this episode confirms is that you cannot allow politicians anywhere near regulating the press. \\"While we respect Mr Miliband's right to defend his father... it is worth stressing that Ralph Miliband wasn't an ordinary private individual but a prominent academic and author who devoted his life to promoting a Marxist dogma which caused so much misery in the world. \\"He hated such British institutions as the Queen, the Church and the Army, and wanted a workers' revolution. Our readers have a right to know that.\\" Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Daily Mail assistant editor Jon Steafel said the picture of Ralph Miliband's grave, which included the caption \\"grave socialist\\", was removed after he personally took a call from Ed Miliband. But he continued to defend the article and headline itself as \\"entirely justified\\". Alastair Campbell, the former director of communications at Downing Street under Tony Blair, said the Daily Mail was \\"the worst of British values posing as the best\\" and its editor Paul Dacre should have appeared on Newsnight himself to defend the article. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: \\"We continue to believe that the article... and a subsequent article... were smears. The deputy editor of the Daily Mail showed tonight he could not justify either of them.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron was asked about the row on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, but said he had not read the original article or the response from the Labour leader. He added, though, that \\"if anyone had a go at my father I would want to respond vigorously\\" so totally \\"understand what Ed's done\\". The prime minister later rejected any comparison between attacks by Conservative-supporting newspapers on Labour politicians and smear campaigns led by Gordon Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride as \\" frankly ludicrous\\". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he supported the Labour leader, tweeting: \\"Politics should be about playing the ball, not the man, certainly not the man's family.\\" But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt challenged Ed Miliband to distance himself from his father's views on capitalism, saying  \\"Ralph Miliband was no friend of the free market economy... I've never heard Ed Miliband say he supports the free market economy.\\" In a statement, the Labour Party said: \\"Ed Miliband wrote his right to reply article because he wanted to state clearly that his father loved Britain. \\"He wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late father's reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father... the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further.\\"","output":"Labour leader Ed Miliband criticized the Daily Mail for publishing an article that claimed his father, Ralph Miliband, hated Britain and portrayed his legacy as evil. The paper refused to apologize and stood by the story, though its deputy editor admitted that including a picture of Ralph Miliband's grave on the website version of the story was an \\"error of judgement.\\" Ed Miliband responded to the article in a piece for the newspaper, highlighting his father's service in the Navy and defending his own political views as different from his father's. He called the article a lie, questioning its morality and boundaries."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by.

After snapping their three-game losing streak against the Seattle Seahawks the weekend before, the Packers returned home to face their first AFC opponent of the season, the 2007 AFC South Champion Indianapolis Colts. The game started with the Packers in possession and the Packers started off the game with a nice 14-yard run by RB Ryan Grant for a first down. On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards.

During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half.

The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game.

Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the year 632, after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \\"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication.

When you use clear aerosols, you may have a difficult time telling how much spray tan you've applied to your skin. Get into your shower and close the curtain so that you don't accidentally spray tanning product onto other bathroom surfaces. Put extra moisturizer on your knees and elbows, and spray them lightly compared to other areas. Spray product into the air and step back into it as you would if you were applying perfume. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure that you get enough product on your back. You can also buy a specially designed tanner remover to take off dark spots, streaks or other application errors. Expect to pay between 80 and 100. Summary:","output":"To ensure a smooth and even tan, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: body scrub, loofah, clear aerosol tanning spray, moisturizer, and tanner remover (if needed). 2. Begin by using a body scrub and loofah in the shower to exfoliate your skin, focusing on removing dead surface skin cells. This prevents dark brown or orange speckles after tanning. 3. Ensure the bathroom area is free from items that may be stained by the tanning product. Close the shower curtain to protect surfaces. 4. Apply extra moisturizer to knees and elbows, as these areas tend to absorb more tanning product and can become overly dark. 5. Using the clear aerosol tanning spray, stand in the shower and spray the product into the air. Step back into the mist, as if applying perfume. Repeat this 2 to 3 times to cover your back adequately. 6. Apply the tanning spray lightly on the knees and elbows compared to other areas, as they are already moisturized. 7. If mistakes are made, use a specially designed tanner remover to correct dark spots, streaks, or other application errors. Note that these products typically cost around 80 to 100.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose beau's father forbids his son to associate with the Griffith family?  Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many. To impress his six-year-old daughter Corinne, he spends the family's savings to buy his own circus, simply so the little girl can have her own pony. His elder daughter Augusta becomes distraught as her father makes some questionable business deals under the influence of alcohol.  This  causes strife within the Griffith household and makes her beau's father (the local bank president) forbid his son to associate with the Griffith family. After his squandering leaves the Griffiths in debt, wife Ambolyn packs up Augusta and Corinne and moves to Texarkana, Texas, where her father, Anthony Ghio, is the mayor. Griffith attempts to use his circus to help Ghio's bid for reelection, but accidentally causes Ambolyn to end up with a broken hand. Despondent, he leaves for Louisiana and is little seen or heard from by the family. Talked into an attempt at reconciliation, Papa is reluctant, believing the Griffiths want nothing more to do with him, but he is welcomed back with open arms. The answer is:","output":"Augusta's beau's father forbids his son to associate with the Griffith family. The beau's father is the local bank president."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference  many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity  of an artist. Some of Chekhov's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 1940s.

However, the rephrased sentence you provided, \\"I am sure it takes someone (sic) knows nothing about farming to predict accurately looks at risk for an upcoming year and then design an assistance program which actually extends more help to the farmers in neighbouring provinces than the farmers that actually need it,\\" is not entirely accurate when compared to the initial paragraph.

The original paragraph does criticize the individual or system in question, but it does so sarcastically by referring to a \\"particular form of genius\\" rather than directly stating their incompetence. In the rephrased sentence, the criticism is direct and harsher, asserting that someone who \\"knows nothing about farming\\" is responsible. This slight difference in tone impacts the overall meaning and connotation of the two sentences. In conclusion, while both sentences express criticism of the individual or system responsible for predicting at-risk provinces and designing assistance programs, they do so in different ways. The initial paragraph uses sarcasm to imply that the individual or system has failed, while the rephrased sentence directly states that someone with no knowledge of farming is the reason for the failure.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”.

Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki. What is an example of International Style? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The International Style emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the need for simplicity, functionality, and a departure from historic architectural traditions. It emphasized rationality, the use of new materials and technologies, and the pursuit of a universally applicable design. The Seagram Building in New York City, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, is an excellent example of the International Style. Completed in 1958, the Seagram Building is a 38-story high-rise office tower located on Park Avenue. The structure embodies the International Style's key principles, such as minimalism, an emphasis on straight lines and geometrical forms, and the incorporation of steel and glass in its construction. The use of these materials not only simplified the design process but also allowed for the creation of large open spaces, a fundamental aspect of the International Style. The Seagram Building has a steel frame supported by large vertical steel columns, while the outer façade is made of glass and bronze. This was a pioneering effort in the use of curtain wall systems, in which the outer envelope is non-load bearing and functions solely as a protective skin. The innovative design not only provided a sleek, unadorned exterior but also maximized the natural light entering the building, thus increasing energy efficiency. One of the defining features of the International Style is the concept of “form follows function,” which means that buildings should prioritize utility and efficiency over ornamentation. The Seagram Building exemplifies this principle, as its design is rooted in the desire for an efficient, functional workspace. The simple rectangular form, with its open floor plans, allowed for maximum flexibility in interior design while also promoting a sense of openness and cohesion for the occupants. Additionally, the Seagram Building incorporates elements of urban design that were part of the International Style's philosophy. The generous plaza space in front of the building serves as an urban oasis and gathering space, a break from the dense fabric of Manhattan. This is a reflection of the International Style's dedication to the integration of architecture and urban planning principles, with an emphasis on creating cohesive and functional spaces for the public. In summary, the Seagram Building, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, is a prime example of the International Style in architecture. Its minimalist design, innovative use of new materials and technologies, and emphasis on functionality exemplify the key principles of the style. The building has since become an iconic structure and has greatly influenced the design of high-rise office buildings around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Packers played at Lambeau Field for the second time in five days, a Thursday night game versus their divisional rivals, the Minnesota Vikings. The game was played on the third anniversary of the passing of Irv Favre, Brett Favre's father. In the first quarter, the Packers entered the red zone on each of their drives, but only scored once on a 38-yard field goal from kicker Dave Rayner. Rayner would miss his next two field goals. The Packers defence forced the Vikings to punt on all their possessions in the first half. The Packers scored on the final play of the half with a 44-yard field goal from Dave Rayner. In the third quarter cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson, marking his seventh interception of the season extending a career-high. Later in the third quarter, Brett Favre was intercepted by cornerback Fred Smoot. Smoot returned the interception into the end zone, gaining the first lead of the game for the Vikings. In the fourth quarter the Packers drove the ball into Vikings territory, but tight end Bubba Franks fumbled the ball at the two-yard line, turning possession over to the Vikings. The Packers drove the ball 41&#160;yards on their next possession to set Dave Rayner in position to attempt a field goal. Rayner made a 44-yard field goal with 1:34 left in the game to give the packers a 9-7 lead. The Vikings were unable to score on their last possession which granted the Packers their seventh win of the season. Despite scoring only nine points, the Packers recorded 19 first downs and 319 total yards. Brett Favre completed 26 of 50 passes, gaining 285&#160;yards. Favre also recorded two interceptions. Defensively, the Packers limited the Vikings to three total first downs and a 2-14 first down rate. The Vikings punted ten times in the game. Packers defensive end, Aaron Kampman had three sacks in the game. The game marked only the third time in NFL history when the losing team scored the only touchdown off a defensive turnover, the first coming from another 9-7 result at Lambeau Field between the Packers and Vikings with the Vikings beating the Packers in that contest. How many passes did Brett Favre not complete?","output":"Brett Favre tried to throw 50 passes in that game, and he completed 26 of them. If we want to know how many passes he did not complete, we can subtract the completed passes from the total tried passes like this: 50 (total tried passes) - 26 (completed passes) = 24 (not completed passes) So, Brett Favre did not complete 24 passes in that game."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

What's more, you don't even need to touch the egg to get it to go in! For this experiment you will need: *a hard-boiled egg *a glass bottle with a mouth just slightly smaller than the egg (a fruit-drink bottle works well) *a 8-cm by 8-cm(3-inch by 3-inch)piece of newspaper *a match Remove the shell from the egg. Set the egg on the mouth of the bottle to see that the egg does not fit through the mouth. Light the paper. Remove the egg from the mouth of the bottle and drop the burning paper into the bottle. Before the fire goes out, set the egg back onto the mouth of the bottle. Within a few seconds the egg will squeeze  through the mouth and into the bottle. As it entered the bottle, the egg may have broken into pieces. This happens when the diameter  of the egg is more than about 0.5 cm(about 3/16 inch) larger than the diameter of the bottle's opening. Why does the egg slide into the bottle, even though no one is pushing it? Because the pressure of the air is pushing it. Before the burning paper is put into the bottle, the pressure of the air inside is the same as outside. The burning paper, however, heats the air inside. This causes the air inside to expand. When the egg is placed on top of the bottle, it seals  the bottle. When the fire goes out, the air inside cools. As it cools, the air contracts , and the pressure of the air inside becomes less than the pressure outside. Then, the higher outside pressure pushes the egg into the bottle! Question: Why will the egg break into pieces while entering the bottle? Options: A: Because of the burning paper. B: Because the diameter of the egg is too larger than that of the bottles opening. C: Because it is cool inside the bottle. D: Because the pressure of the air inside is larger.

The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter, who was followed by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.Humphreys, a Naval captain, had married Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere.

It showcases emotional turmoil, conflict, and resilience in the face of adversity. The protagonist, Aliah, is experiencing the weight of her sister Eliana's legacy as well as her struggle with accepting that legacy and the beliefs associated with it. Let us dissect this segment for a deeper understanding. The text starts with the action of someone tapping the pendant on Aliah's neck. This simple action is powerful as it serves both as a physical reminder of the pendant's presence and a metaphorical reminder of the weight of her sister's legacy. This weight appears to lie heavy on Aliah, which amplifies the importance and emotional impact of the pendant. As the person taps the pendant, Aliah's own heartbeat betrays her anxiety. This anxiety lies beneath the surface, and the fear of stepping into her sister's shoes as well as reconciling with her identity is palpable. By feeling her heartbeat, the audience can empathize with her emotions and understand her struggles in grappling with her legacy. The tears that blur Aliah's vision add an additional layer of emotional intensity to this scene. Aliah's tears signify the overwhelming pain, sadness, and uncertainty she is experiencing due to her attachment to Eliana's pendant. The fact that tears blur her sight serves as a metaphor for her uncertain outlook on life as she questions her path, identity, and the beliefs forced upon her. Aliah's words \\"it's Eliana's pendant. Not mine. So how can it be my reality?\\" express her denial and resistance to accept the legacy and the belief system attached to the pendant. It also showcases a fierce need to maintain her own identity, separate from her sister. Aliah's argument that \\"no one can force their beliefs on me\\" underlines her refusal to bend to the expectations and ideologies of others, defying her circumstances to remain true to herself. In conclusion, this scene portrays a complex emotional struggle within Aliah as she navigates her sister's legacy, the pendant, and the beliefs surrounding it. Her fierce determination to retain her own identity and avoid submitting to others' beliefs highlights her strength of character and the intense emotions she experiences in her journey. The vivid imagery of the pendant tap, the pulsing heartbeat, and the tears blurring her vision combine to form a powerful scene that draws the reader into the protagonist's world, making them empathize with and understand her pain and defiance in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me.

Sentence 1: \\"so it's that dry heat\\" This sentence describes a weather condition that is both hot and dry. The word \\"that\\" implies it is a specific type of heat - one known for being dry. Sentence 2: \\"It's arid.\\" This sentence describes a condition, \\"arid\\", which means it relates to an environment or weather condition that lacks moisture or experiences very little rainfall (and is typically dry and hot). Step 2: Assess the relationship between the two sentences. Both sentences seem to be describing similar conditions - dryness and heat. The first sentence specifically mentions \\"dry heat\\", while the second one refers to an \\"arid\\" condition, which implies a dry and hot environment. Step 3: Evaluate if the second sentence is true when the first one is. By understanding that both sentences describe similar conditions of dryness and heat, it can be deduced that when Sentence 1 is true (meaning there is a \\"dry heat\\"), it is likely that Sentence 2 is also true (the weather described by Sentence 1 is \\"arid\\").

And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is most likely the author's occupation?

Thin crust: This term implies that the pizza dough is rolled out or stretched quite thinly, resulting in a crispy and crunchy crust. Thin crust pizzas are often contrasted with thick crust or deep-dish pizzas, which have a denser, bread-like texture. 2. Pizza: Pizza is a widely popular Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread base, typically topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients. The term \\"pizza\\" is crucial in this sentence as it designates the type of food being described. 3. Cheese: This term refers to the dairy product that serves as the primary topping on the described pizza. Cheese is an essential component of most pizzas and provides flavor, texture, and richness to the dish. The mention of \\"just cheese\\" highlights that no other toppings are present, indicating a focus on simplicity and the classic combination of cheese and tomato sauce. 4. Top: The use of the word \\"top\\" in this context signifies the layering of ingredients on the pizza, with cheese being the final layer.

Q: The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle. On the pattern of the Byzantine system the Umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on march or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body. The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles.

Write an article based on this \\"The Conservatives have taken charge at two councils in Suffolk which previously had no overall control.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Conservative Party Claims Victory at Two Councils in Suffolk as Political Power Shifts Introduction: The political landscape of Suffolk has undergone a significant change as the Conservatives have recently gained control of two councils. These local government bodies were previously operating under no overall control, meaning that no single political party had held a majority representation. This accomplishment signifies an important step forward for the Conservative party, as they consolidate their power in the region. In this article, we will examine the factors and strategies that may have contributed to their success and how this political shift may impact the future of local governance in Suffolk. Background on Council Elections and the Prior Situation: Suffolk, a county in the East of England, has traditionally seen a mix of political parties in control at the local level. In recent years, both the Conservative and the Labour party have held power in various councils across the county. However, two councils that remained under no overall control signaled an opportunity for any of the competing political parties to claim a stronger foothold in the region. The Conservative Strategy that Led to Success: The Conservatives were able to claim victory in these two councils by deploying a targeted campaign strategy that resonated with local voters. They focused on key issues such as infrastructure development, improved social services, and economic growth to engender support from the community. Additionally, the Conservative party capitalized on any division or lack of coordination among the opposition parties. By presenting a united front and a clear message, the Conservatives were able to garner the support of undecided voters and those dissatisfied with the performance of the previous administration. The Impact of the Conservative Party Gaining Control of the Two Councils: The Conservative party taking charge in these two councils has several implications for the local political landscape. Firstly, it showcases their ability to mobilize support and secure key victories in councils that were once believed to be out of their reach. This may lead to increased confidence among party supporters and potentially draw more attention and resources to their campaigns in future elections. Secondly, this shift in power may result in new policies and initiatives that align with the Conservatives' views. Suffolk residents can expect to see changes in the way local government operates and delivers services, as the new administration begins to implement its political agenda. It will be crucial for constituents to engage with their local representatives and stay informed about how these changes will impact their lives. Lastly, this success may embolden the Conservatives to push for further political victories in other councils where they currently hold a minority or are in close competition with other parties. This could potentially enhance their influence across Suffolk and strengthen their position in future elections. Conclusion: The recent victories of the Conservative party in two Suffolk councils marks a notable shift in the local political landscape and demonstrates the potential for further changes in the coming years. As the Conservatives settle into their new roles, it remains to be seen how their political agenda will shape the future of governance in Suffolk. Residents and political observers alike will be keeping a close eye on policy changes and the overall impact on regional development and welfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Schwyz is a canton in central Switzerland between the Alps in the south, Lake Lucerne to the west and Lake Zürich in the north, centered on and named after the town of Schwyz.  - Stauffacher is a tram junction ( lines 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 14 ) in Aussersihl , Zurich , next to the St. Jakob church , situated along the Badenerstrasse between the Bäcker and the Stauffacher streets . The tram stop was named after the street , which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893 . Stauffacher is officially just the name of the tram stop , not the square , and there was formerly a Stauffacherplatz some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl ( named in 1898 ) . Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate Stauffacherplatz with the tram stop , leading to confusion with the actual Stauffacherplatz , the latter was renamed to Ernst - Nobs - Platz in 2003 . St. Jakob was the site of a sick - house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century . The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221 . It was the site of the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl in 1443 . In 1677 , the sick - house was transformed into a Pfrundhaus ( senior citizens ' residence ) , disestablished in 1842 . The current St. Jakob church building was inaugurated in 1901 .  - The Limmat is a river in Switzerland. The river commences at the outfall of Lake Zurich, in the southern part of the city of Zurich. From Zurich it flows in a northwesterly direction, after 35 km reaching the river Aare. The confluence is located north of the small town of Brugg and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - The Sihl is a Swiss river that rises near the Druesberg mountain in the canton of Schwyz, and eventually flows into the Limmat in the centre of the city of Zürich. It has a length of , including the Sihlsee reservoir, through which the river flows. Water is abstracted from the river at the Sihlsee, leading to decreased downstream water flows and a consequent negative impact on water quality.  - Aegidius (or Giles or Glig) Tschudi (5 February 150528 February 1572) was an eminent member of the Tschudi family, of Glarus, Switzerland. His best known work is the Chronicon Helveticum, a history of the early Swiss Confederation.  - The Rütlischwur is a legendary oath of the Old Swiss Confederacy, taken on the Rütli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne near Seelisberg. The oath is notably featured in the play \\"William Tell\\" (\\"Wilhelm Tell\\") by Friedrich Schiller.  - Werner Stauffacher was supposedly the name of the representative of the canton of Schwyz, one of the three founding cantons at the legendary Rütlischwur of 1291, as told by Aegidius Tschudi.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat The answer to this question is:","output":"survive The primary goal of a poor person having food is to survive. Every individual requires food to provide energy, essential nutrients, and sustenance for their body to properly function. Food is essential for maintaining good health, staying alive, and in the case of a poor person, this importance is magnified due to limited resources and the potential inability to access adequate nourishment. When a poor person has the opportunity to eat food, it helps them meet their essential nutritional needs and prevents the detrimental consequences of malnutrition. Adequate nourishment can improve overall well-being, physical and mental health, cognitive function, and resistance to various illnesses. Depending on the availability of food, a poor person may have inconsistent meals, making it even more critical for them to focus on food that will allow them to survive and maintain their health as best as possible. While the other options like digesting, being full, will not starve, and getting fat might apply to different contexts, the most suitable and comprehensive answer is 'survive.' The reason is that it broadly covers the foremost priorities and necessities of a poor person when it comes to consuming food.

For the recipe, you'll need 1 cup (225 g) of white rice, though you can adjust the amount based on how many people you're cooking for. In general, you should have ½ cup (112 ½ g) of uncooked rice per person.","output":"Once the rice has been measured, proceed to thoroughly rinse it under cool running water until the water runs clear, which will help remove any excess starch and prevent the rice from becoming too sticky when cooked. While rinsing, gently rub the rice between your fingers to further remove any debris or impurities that may be present. After the rice is properly rinsed, allow it to drain well in the colander for a few minutes to ensure that no excess water remains. Next, prepare a pot or saucepan with a tight-fitting lid to cook the rice. For each cup of rice, add 1 ¾ cups (414 ml) of water or broth to the pot. If desired, you can also add a pinch of salt or a small splash of oil for added flavor and to prevent any sticking. Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to high. Once the liquid begins to boil, give the rice a quick stir to prevent it from clumping together. As soon as the water is boiling, lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover the pot with the lid and allow the rice to cook undisturbed for approximately 15 to 18 minutes, or until it has absorbed all of the liquid and is tender. Avoid lifting the lid while the rice cooks, as this will release steam and may result in unevenly cooked rice. When the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it stand, still covered, for about 5 minutes. This will allow any remaining steam to be absorbed and will help to further fluff up the rice. After the standing time, gently fluff the rice with a fork, taking care to not compact it or break the grains. Before serving, taste the rice and adjust the seasoning if necessary. For added garnish or flavor, you can mix in chopped herbs like cilantro or parsley, or a small pat of butter or drizzle of sesame oil. Enjoy your perfectly cooked white rice as a versatile and satisfying side dish or as the foundation for countless recipes, from stir-fries and burritos to sushi rolls and rice bowls. By following these simple steps, you'll be able to consistently cook perfect white rice without a rice cooker, and you'll have the confidence to tackle a wide variety of rice-based dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The number of cranes that pepper the skyline is a useful indicator of economic activity.","output":"Title: The Sky-high Impact of Cranes on Economic Activity: An In-depth Analysis Introduction Cranes, the majestic construction giants, silently dot the skyline of many cities around the world. They've become a visible embodiment of the growth and development taking place within these urban landscapes. As the global economy recovers from the downturn caused by COVID-19, many businesses and governments are eager to kickstart their development. In this context, it is interesting to explore the presence of cranes as an indicator of economic activity around the world. The number of these looming giants can provide insights into the extent of investment in infrastructure and the overall prosperity of a territory. What Do Cranes Signify? Cranes are heavy construction equipment used for lifting and transporting heavy materials during the construction process. Commonly found in the heart of urban territories, cranes are primarily utilized for the vertical transportation of equipment and materials at construction sites, including skyscrapers, roads, bridges, and other major infrastructure projects. The presence of cranes at a construction project indicates that capital investments are being made in the area, often leading to new businesses, homes, and infrastructure. With substantial resources being allocated, cranes signify confidence in the economic growth and an increase in economic activity in and around the region. The Crane Index Some industry analysts have come up with an informal metric they called the \\"Crane Index.\\" This index is a rough indicator of a city's economic health, wherein the more cranes visible, the better the economic condition. In order to determine the Crane Index, researchers compile the number of fixed cranes at active construction sites within a certain region. This index has been particularly useful for urban planners, economists, and real estate professionals seeking insight into construction activity and trends. The Crane Index has been credited for its accurate prediction of economic boom times in regions such as Australia, where the Sydney Crane Index in 2013 presaged economic growth in the construction sector. Similarly, the number of cranes in Dubai acted as a forewarning for the Dubai crisis in 2008. The Benefits of Crane-Driven Growth Cranes' presence can have several positive impacts on the economy of a region, which include: 1. Job Creation: An increased number of cranes in a city corresponds to more construction projects, which in turn generates employment opportunities for architects, engineers, construction workers, and a wide range of suppliers and support services. 2. Urban Revitalization: Construction activity depicted by the number of cranes often leads to better infrastructure, housing, and amenities, attracting more people to live and work in the area. This results in a positive cycle of economic activity as the inflow of people and businesses create demand for goods and services. 3. Increased Property Values: Infrastructure development drives up the value of the surrounding properties, as improved accessibility and better amenities make the area more attractive for investors and residents. This leads to capital appreciation for property owners and generates increased tax revenue for the government. 4. Confidence and Foreign Investments: A skyline peppered with cranes often signals a robust and growing economy, which can lure foreign investors to invest in the country. The increased perception of economic stability attracts additional foreign direct investments, further boosting the business environment and job creation. Conclusion The number of cranes gracing the skyline can provide an insightful glimpse into the immediate economic activity and overall health of a region. Although it may not be a scientific measure, the Crane Index serves as a useful, quick-reference tool for gauging the vitality of urban construction projects. Ultimately, the humble crane plays a vital role in the growth and wellbeing of communities and functions as an indicator of where an economy is headed, reflecting the aspirations of its people towards a prosperous future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Angela makes a mad dash to save seats for her friends, Mrs. Brinks (with help from Nannette) sits in front of her, blocking her view. Angela scornfully imagines herself Digivolving into Angelamon to defeat Mrs. Brinks and Nannette, removing all obstacles in enjoying her movie. However, everyone in the audience realizes they are in the wrong movie, so they quickly leave to go to the correct theater, leaving Mrs. Brinks and Nannette behind with the latter covered in food.Eight Years Ago[edit]Main article: Digimon AdventureIn Highton View Terrace, before their adventure in the Digital World, siblings Tai and Kari Kamiya witness a Digi-Egg emerging from their computer. The egg soon hatches, revealing a Botamon. The Digimon rapidly digivolves into Koromon and then a very large Agumon, who unintentionally destroys a good part of the neighborhood, Kari states that this isn't the same Agumon they become friends later with. A second Digi-Egg appears in the sky to reveal a Parrotmon. Agumon digivolves to Greymon, but brutally loses the battle. Tai wakes Greymon with Kari's whistle, who defeats Parrotmon and disappears with him.Four Years Later[edit]Main article: Our War GameAbout six months after the DigiDestined departed from the Digital World, Izzy discovers a Digi-Egg on the internet that has been infected by a virus. He rushes over to Tai's apartment to inform him about the newly hatched Digimon, Kuramon. Tai and Izzy monitor it and are astonished as Kuramon consumes large amounts of computer data to rapidly digivolve to Keramon. Gennai appears in a transmission from the Digital World, warning them about the dangers of his growth. He dispatches Agumon and Tentomon to stop the Digimon. Keramon digivolves into Infermon and easily defeats the Champion and Ultimate forms of Tentomon and Agumon. Izzy realizes that Keramon completely skipped over his Champion form and digivolved straight to his Ultimate level. Tai tries to alert the rest of the DigiDestined, but only succeeds in enlisting the help of Matt, T.K., Gabumon and Patamon. Agumon and Gabumon Warp Digivolve to WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, prompting Infermon to Digivolve into Diaboromon. A massive amount of emails are sent to Tai and Izzy from people around the world who are watching the battle from their computers. This causes WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon to slow down and they are severely injured in the fight. Diaboromon begins to duplicate himself at an exponential rate and infects computers at the Pentagon, launching two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles: one headed for Colorado, the other for Tai and Izzy's neighborhood in Odaiba, Tokyo. Refusing to lose hope, Tai and Matt's bond with their Digimon allow them to become digital and enter the internet to comfort WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon. Tai and Matt remind them about all the people around the world watching them and sending emails with encouraging words. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon are revived by the collective power of the millions of children around the world and DNA Digivolve to Omnimon. Omnimon easily defeats all of the Diaboromon copies, leaving only the original. With one minute left until the missile impact, Diaboromon is still too fast for them to hit. With seconds left on the clock, Izzy redirects the incoming emails to Diaboromon to slow him down. Omnimon destroys Diaboromon by stabbing him through the head just in time and the nukes are disabled just before detonation. However, the same virus that created Diaboromon tracks down Willis and corrupts Kokomon.Present Day[edit]Main article: Hurricane TouchdownWhile visiting Mimi in New York, T.K. and Kari witness a battle between Willis, Terriermon, and Kokomon's corrupted Champion form Wendigomon (still referred to as Kokomon). Wendigomon cryptically insists for Willis to \\"go back\\", to which he interprets as returning to Colorado. Thinking that he is to be in danger, Kari e-mails Davis Motomiya, Yolei Inoue, and Cody Hida for help in hopes of assembling in Colorado. However, T.K. and Kari's train becomes derailed by Wendigomon on the way and they are unable to meet with the others. Meanwhile, after taking planes and taxis, Davis, Yolei, and Cody meet Willis in a truck. When Willis tries to get their group transportation to his house for some pizza, the ride leaves without him and Davis; however, Davis devises a plan to get themselves to Colorado faster with the help of Raidramon. At the rendez-vous point, Davis, Yolei, and Cody began to question Willis' knowledge about Wendigomon. Hesitantly, Willis reveals that he, as a child, tried to create a digi-egg after experiencing the joys of having his twin Digimon (Terriermon and Kokomon). However, this only resulted in Diaboromon's creation. Willis assumes full responsibility for the situation. However, Davis and Terriermon convince him to let them help, as they are friends and are on the same team. At Willis's home the next morning, Wendigomon expectedly reappears, but Digivolves to Antylamon and easily defeats the DigiDestined. Once digivolved into Cherubimon, he proceeds to eat their Digimon, but T.K. and Kari arrive at the nick of time to provide back-up with Angemon and Angewomon. Angry, Cherubimon de-Digivolves the Digimon then de-ages the Digidestined, revealing that he wanted Willis to \\"go back\\" in time to when the \\"strange\\" spirit first attacked him. To combat him, Angewomon and Angemon Digivolve to their Mega forms, Magnadramon and Seraphimon, to release two Golden Digi-Eggs for Willis and Davis.

To better understand the revision of the Julian calendar and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, let's delve into the calendar's history and the role Pope Gregory XIII played in its creation. The Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE, was widely used across the Roman Empire and in European territories that had contact with the Romans. It was designed as a solar year model, meaning it was intended to accurately depict the time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the Sun. The calendar year lasted 365.25 days, with an additional day added every four years as a leap year. Although the idea behind the Julian calendar was innovative for its time, it had a significant flaw: the actual solar year is about 11 minutes shorter than 365.25 days. This slight miscalculation began to cause a shift in the calendar, leading to the dates of important Christian celebrations like Easter gradually moving away from their originally intended timeframes. This issue concerned religious leaders, including Pope Gregory XIII, who sought to revise the Julian calendar to correct this discrepancy. Pope Gregory XIII, born Ugo Buoncompagni, was elected to the papacy in 1572. His interest in reforming the calendar led him to assemble a team of scholars, mathematicians, and astronomers under the supervision of physician and astronomer Aloysius Lilius. This group proposed a more accurate solar year length of 365.2425 days, which would reduce the miscalculation of the Julian calendar. The new calendar system became known as the Gregorian calendar, named in honor of Pope Gregory XIII. To officially implement this new calendar, Pope Gregory XIII issued the papal bull Inter gravissimas on 24 February 1582. This decree detailed the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, including instructions for adjusting the date. The change included the removal of ten days in October 1582 and a revised leap year system that omitted leap years in years divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. While the Gregorian calendar was initially only adopted within Catholic countries, it progressively gained acceptance across the globe. Today, the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used civil calendar in the world, though its implementation was a collaborative effort involving several individuals and teams. To summarize, the statement that the Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted by Pope Gregory XIII is essentially correct, but it's important to recognize the team of scholars who contributed to the project and the multi-faceted process that led to the calendar's development and widespread adoption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What country was not allowed to be part of the treaty? Context: The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.

Information:  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian. He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for \\"LA Weekly\\" and \\"Rolling Stone Australia\\".  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner.   - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles. It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, \\"Minor Disturbance\\" referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (\\"Too Young to Rock\\") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (\\"Fleeting Fury\\"). Upon its release, \\"Minor Disturbance\\", Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations.  - SST Records is an American independent record label formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California by musician Greg Ginn. The company was initially formed in 1966 by Ginn at age 12, as Solid State Tuners, a small business through which he sold electronics equipment. Ginn repurposed the company as a record label to release material by his band Black Flag.  - Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.  - Lyle Preslar is an American musician best known for being the guitar player and songwriter for the hardcore punk band Minor Threat . Before that , he was the vocalist for The Extorts , whom later became State of Alert after he quit . Despite not performing on any recordings of State of Alert , Preslar received co-writing credit for the songs \`\` Draw Blank '' from the No Policy EP and \`\` I Hate the Kids '' from the Dischord Records compilation Flex Your Head . After Minor Threat dissolved , he played guitar in The Meatmen and the first incarnation of Samhain .

They can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).<ref name=\\"Materials/Polyamide\\"></ref>  - Ian Thomas Garner MacKaye (born April 16, 1962) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, musician, record label owner and producer.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Write an article with the title: \\"Angel of the North won't turn green for St Patrick's Day\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Angel of the North Won't Turn Green for St Patrick's Day\\" The iconic, emotionally resonant symbol of the North, lovingly christened the Angel of the North, doesn't intend to turn green in celebration of St Patrick's Day this year. Despite various global landmarks routinely participating in the \\"Global Greening\\" initiative on this festive day, the Giant of Gateshead remains a notable exception. Dressed in its perennial rust-red apparel, the Angel of the North stands as a silent paragon of Britain's industrial heritage. Ever since its inception in 1998, the towering statue by Antony Gormley started diplomatically ignoring St Patrick's Day's color-themed tradition. This decision, while initially prompting some discontent among certain quarters, has gradually gained acceptance and understanding among locals and visitors alike.  The trend of transforming world landmarks into lush green on St Patrick's Day, also known as \\"Global Greening,\\" started in 2010 with the initiative of Tourism Ireland. The aim was to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick, and promote Ireland as a tourist destination worldwide. However, the Angel of the North maintains its stance of neutrality.  The reasons behind this decision derive from the statue's deep-rooted symbolism. The Angel of the North is more than a statue. It is a testament to the industriousness and resilience of the Northern communities. It is a proud tribute to the coal miners who toiled beneath the statue's site for over two centuries. It is an eternal monument signifying time and change, reflecting the transition from an industrial age to the information age.  To paint or light the Angel green for a day would be to overlay another story on top of the one the statue already tells – and has been telling for over two decades. The consensus is that such an act might inadvertently dilute the potency of its original narrative and what it stands for, thereby potentially diverting from the intended focus of this emblem of northern resilience and rebirth. Worthy of mention is the fact that not conforming to this global tradition on St Patrick's Day doesn't mean disrespect or disregard for the celebration itself. Numerous other UK landmarks participate with thorough enthusiasm. London Eye, the Eden Project in Cornwall, Nelson's column, and many more typically deck themselves in green lights, showcasing solidarity with the Irish community and fostering the spirit of inclusiveness that constitutes the bedrock of the United Kingdom's societal fabric. St Patrick's Day celebrations will continue in all their vigor, the world turning a shade greener with collective enthusiasm. Even as the Angel of the North chooses to stand in its rust-red glory, it does so respecting this global gesture, not belittling it. The Angel bears silent testimony to the fact that on St Patrick's Day, everyone can be Irish, each in their own unique way. Wrapping up, the Angel of the North, a titanic sentinel rooted firmly in the soils of northeastern England, will persist in its rusty-red color regardless of the holiday. It's not about rebuffing a tradition, but about holding onto its own, an enduring depiction of resilience and the history of the North. True to its role as a perennial northern icon, the Angel will remain as is, its calm, rust-red exterior narrating the saga of an era bygone, even as the world celebrates St Patrick's Day in varying shades of green.---"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Richard Francis Dennis Barry III (born March 28, 1944) is an American retired professional basketball player who played in both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in history by the NBA in 1996, Barry is the only player to lead the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), ABA and NBA in scoring for an individual season. He was known for his unorthodox but effective underhand free throw shooting technique, and at the time of his retirement in 1980, his .900 free throw percentage ranked first in NBA history. In 1987, Barry was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In Barry's first season in the NBA with the Warriors, the team improved from 17 to 35 victories. In the All-Star Game one season later, Barry erupted for 38 points as the West team stunned the East squad, which featured Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell and head coach Red Auerbach among other all-time greats. Later that season, Barry and company extended the mighty Philadelphia 76ers to six highly competitive games in the NBA Finals, something that Russell and the Boston Celtics could not do in the Eastern Conference playoffs. That 76ers team is considered to be one of the greatest in basketball history.  Nicknamed the \\"Miami Greyhound\\" by longtime San Francisco-area broadcaster Bill King because of his slender physical build and remarkable quickness and instincts, the 6'7\\" Barry won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 25.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game in the 1965-66 season. The following year, he won the 1967 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 38-point outburst and led the NBA in scoring with a 35.6 point per game average -- which still ranks as the eighth- highest output in league annals. Teamed with star center Nate Thurmond in San Francisco, Barry helped take the Warriors to the 1967 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in six games. Including a 55-point outburst in Game 3, Barry averaged 40.8 points per game in the series, an NBA Finals record that stood for three decades.  Upset that he was not paid incentive monies that he believed due from Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli, Barry jumped to the ABA's Oakland Oaks, who offered him a lucrative contract and the chance to play for Bruce Hale, his then father-in-law. The three-year contract offer from Pat Boone, the singer and team owner, was estimated to be worth 500,000, with Barry saying \\"the offer Oakland made me was one I simply couldn't turn down\\" and that it would make him one of basketball's highest-paid players. The courts ordered Barry to sit out the 1967-68 season before he starred in the ABA, upholding the validity of the reserve clause in his contract. He preceded St. Louis Cardinals' outfielder Curt Flood, whose better-known challenge to the reserve clause went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, by two years as the first American major-league professional athlete to bring a court action against it. The ensuing negative publicity cast Barry in a negative light, portraying him as selfish and money-hungry. However, many NBA players at the time were looking at jumping to the ABA for more lucrative contracts. Barry would star in the ABA, twice averaging more than 30 points per game. did he win any awards?","output":"Yes, Richard Francis Dennis Barry III, or simply Rick Barry, did win several awards during his basketball career. As a player, Barry was outstanding and was awarded numerous times. In his first year, he was honored as the NBA Rookie of the Year because he was the best new player. That's like being the best new kid in a school full of really good students. Besides that, he also won the NBA All-Star Game MVP award, which is kind of like being named the best player at a special game where all the best players play. His high scoring in a season also led to him being recognized as the scoring champion in the NBA, the ABA, and even in college games. And despite losing in the NBA finals, his super high scoring earned him the record for highest points per game in the NBA Finals for 30 years. Imagine scoring so many points in important games that nobody could beat your record for a long time! Then, after he retired, which means stopped playing professionally, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is a huge honour.

Write some highlights for the following article: A 23-year-old online poker star has beaten the reigning World Series of Poker Player of the Year in a 1million buy-in charity poker tournament. Holden, Massachusetts, resident Daniel Colman won 15.3million on Tuesday in the Big One for One Drop poker event in Las Vegas. It's the second-largest payout in the series' history, behind only the 18million paid out in the inaugural Big One event in 2012. Mr Colman, a professional card player, refused to talk to reporters after winning the tournament, or even smile, according to The Las Vegas Sun. Daniel Colman of Massachusetts outlasted 41 other poker players to win this 15.3million pile of cash at the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas. Eventually he was persuaded to pose with his winnings and special bracelet, but declined every request for an interview to discuss how he outlasted 41 other players during the three-day event. He wouldn't even talk to ESPN, which is planning to air a six-hour documentary later this month chronicling his victory. Instead Mr Colman sped out of the Rio's Amazon Room within five minutes of the high point of his short career, accompanied by Olivier Busquet and Haralados Voulgaris, high-rolling gamblers presumed to have bankrolled part of his buy-in, the paper reported. Mr Colman, or one of his handlers, apparently said as they rushed out the door that he had 'no interest in promoting poker.' Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native who took second place at the tournament, discussed the event afterward. Just two months ago Mr Colman had just 350,000 in live tournament earnings to his name. Now he's earned more than 18million, the fourth-most any American has made playing poker, according to the Hendon Mob poker database. 'Really he’s a class act, a good kid and I really like the way he plays,' said Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native whom Mr Colman bested, according to Card Player. 'He plays a lot different than a lot of the other young kids, because he’s a lot more careful.' Mr Negreanu took home 8million for his second-place finish. In a 2013 interview with HUSNG.com, Mr Colman said he almost gave up poker the year before to pursue his education. 'Summer of 2012, I was making plans to go back to college and give up poker, but I messed up my applications and then ultimately decided to give poker one last go around,' he said. 'It was winter in Montreal and I was playing every single day. After that, I moved to Rio de Janiero where I definitely didn’t play as much, and now I am back in Montreal in the summer when the weather is nice so my grind isn’t ideal here, but it’s still pretty good.  I’ve also made a lot of trips to Vegas, New York, and back home in Massachusetts, as well as one trip to Sweden for a week.' The Big One tournament raised 4.6million for the One Drop Foundation, a nonprofit created by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and dedicated to providing clean water to developing countries. The event attracts businessmen and poker professionals alike. Highlights:","output":"- A young poker player, Daniel Colman, won a big charity poker event called Big One for One Drop in Las Vegas. - He won 15.3 million, which is a lot of money! - Daniel Colman didn't want to talk to anyone or be happy after he won. - The charity poker event helped raise 4.6 million for a good cause, giving clean water to people who need it.

Does the sentence \\"Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state.\\" answer the question \\"What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?\\" However, it does provide some contextual information that can lead to a better understanding of why tornadoes might be less frequent in the western piedmont area. To answer the original question, it is important to consider various factors that may provide some level of protection or contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont. These factors may include: 1. Topography: The western part of the piedmont region typically has a more varied and hilly terrain compared to the flatter areas in the eastern part of the state. This terrain can have a disrupting effect on the formation and path of tornadoes, as the airflow can become disrupted or redirected by hills and valleys. As a result, tornadoes may be less likely to occur in areas with a more complex topography. 2. Climate: The climate in the western piedmont region can also play a role in tornado development, or lack thereof. It may be characterized by weather conditions that are less conducive to the formation of severe thunderstorms, which are necessary for tornadoes to form. Differences in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure between the western piedmont and the eastern part of the state can limit the formation and intensity of thunderstorms. 3. Prevailing wind patterns: Wind patterns can play a significant role in the development of tornadoes. In some regions, the wind patterns may help to steer atmospheric disturbances and thunderstorms to certain areas, while providing protection to other areas. It is possible that the western piedmont may be less prone to tornadoes due to prevailing wind patterns that reduce the likelihood of severe thunderstorms in the region. 4. Proximity to weather systems: The location of the western piedmont in relation to major weather systems, such as frontal boundaries, jet streams, and low-pressure systems, can influence the likelihood of tornadoes. If the western piedmont is less prone to interacting with such weather systems, it may experience fewer tornadoes than other areas. 5. Urban modification: Lastly, though not a natural protection, urban development and land use changes can also impact the likelihood of a tornado forming or tracking across a specific area. The western piedmont may have more forests, parks, or agricultural lands that serve as barriers to tornado development. This added protection could result in a lower tornado risk compared to the eastern part of the state. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not explicitly address the factors protecting the western piedmont from tornadoes, it provides an indirect clue by mentioning a higher risk of tornadoes in the eastern part of the state. To answer the question comprehensively, one must consider topography, climate, prevailing wind patterns, proximity to weather systems, and urban modification that contribute to the reduced risk of tornadoes in the western piedmont."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

Congo continued preserving their picturesque beaches.  Which country caused less turbidity in the coastal water?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Considering the information provided, it is evident that Congo has caused less turbidity in its coastal waters compared to Nigeria. This conclusion is based on the different approaches each country has taken concerning their coastal environments and the consequences of their actions. Nigeria chose to invest in sand mining and began mining its coastal barriers. Sand mining has several negative effects on the coastal environment, including increased erosion and disturbances to local wildlife. As mentioned, sand mining has contributed to the near extinction of gharials in India, as it destroys nesting grounds for various animals that rely on sandy beaches. In addition to the destruction of fauna, sand mining also impacts the turbidity of water in the coastal region. When underwater and coastal sand is disturbed, it causes an increase in the amount of suspended particles in the water, resulting in greater turbidity. This increase in turbidity is harmful to marine organisms that rely on sunlight, such as coral reefs. The diminished water quality can also have a negative effect on the financial stability of local fisheries, as their primary source of income becomes increasingly jeopardized. Furthermore, the removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, can lead to flooding in beachside communities. The damage caused by sand mining extends beyond the environment and into the local economy, as the attractiveness for tourists degrades, resulting in a decrease in tourism-generated income for these areas.  On the other hand, Congo has opted for preserving their picturesque beaches, which has an overall positive effect on maintaining the turbidity of their coastal waters. By not engaging in sand mining and preserving the natural environment, Congo is effectively allowing essential ecological processes to remain intact and undisturbed, specifically those crucial to the health of their coastal ecosystems, such as dune systems and the habitats that rely on them. This decision results in lower levels of turbidity in the water, ensuring the well-being of marine organisms that depend on sunlight and clear waters to survive. Moreover, Congo's beautiful beaches can remain attractive tourist destinations contributing positively to the local economy. In conclusion, based on the comparison between Nigeria's sand mining activities and Congo's focus on preserving their beaches, it is clear that Congo has caused less turbidity in their coastal waters. By maintaining their natural ecosystems and avoiding destructive activities such as sand mining, Congo has safeguarded the health of their coastal environment and the organisms that inhabit it, while also allowing for the continued benefit of tourism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to who won the final hoh big brother 20??","output":"Big Brother 20, the 20th season of the popular reality television series, aired in 2018 on the CBS network in the United States. The show is formatted around a competition where several contestants (\\"houseguests\\") live together in a custom-built house, being constantly recorded by video cameras. Each week, the houseguests vote to evict one of their own until only two remain, and the final winner is decided by a jury of previously evicted houseguests. The show has three parts of the final Head of Household (HOH) competition, which typically determines the two houseguests who make it to the final two. In Big Brother 20, the final HOH competition took place between the last three houseguests – Tyler Crispen, Kaycee Clark, and JC Mounduix. Here's a breakdown of each part of the final HOH competition: 1. Part 1: \\"Jetpack Attack\\" – This competition required the houseguests to hold on to jetpacks while being suspended in the air. They needed to endure elements such as water, wind, and an earthquake simulation. The last houseguest remaining on their jetpack would win this round. Kaycee Clark emerged as the winner of Part 1. 2. Part 2: \\"Mount Evictus\\" - The competition was a combination of mental and physical tasks. It required the houseguests to climb a rock wall and complete a puzzle by placing the faces of their fellow houseguests in the correct order according to eviction weeks. Tyler Crispen and JC Mounduix faced off in this part, with Tyler emerging as the winner. 3. Part 3: \\"Jury Oddcasts\\" – This final competition took place live during the season finale. It involved the two winners of the previous parts (Kaycee and Tyler). Both contestants had to predict how the jurors completed statements about their time in the Big Brother house. The houseguest with the most correct answers would become the final HOH. In this case, Kaycee emerged victorious with five correct answers compared to Tyler's four. As the final HOH, Kaycee Clark had the power to choose who she would take with her to the final two. She chose Tyler Crispen, resulting in the eviction of JC Mounduix.

As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie.

The answer to the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words is called \\"Má vlast.\\" It represents a significant development in Smetana's compositional style, marking his growth as a modern neo-Romantic composer able to handle large-scale forces and utilize advanced musical concepts. \\"Má vlast\\" embodies the essence of national struggle and is considered an iconic piece in the realm of Czech music. This work allowed Smetana to truly express his unique artistic vision, separating him from other composers and solidifying his reputation as a leading figure in Czech music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

America’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond. In many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system – years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle – cannot come soon enough for them. But for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US’s commitment to return to expensive manned missions. “For a while I thought president Obama was going to see sense and would wean America off its fascination with putting men and women into space by scrapping manned missions,” the Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg told the Observer. “Unfortunately, with the flight of Orion, that hope has now been dashed.” Scientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe’s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system’s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future. The existence of these two camps – manned versus unmanned – reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration. “We learned a great deal from the Apollo missions, but their landings were all confined to sites near the lunar equator on one side of the Moon,” he said. “The samples they returned to Earth were made up of rocks found lying around the surface. But on the far side of the Moon, there is a region where meteorite impacts have excavated material from deep below the lunar surface. If we could explore these regions and bring samples back to Earth, we will transform our understanding of how the Earth and its satellite, the Moon, formed in the distant past.” Crawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples. “These missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,” he said. “Humans and robots would work together.” And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added. This vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. “If you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system’s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,” he said. Rees stresses that human spaceflight could still be pursued, without damage to science, if it was left to entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, whose SpaceX rockets are now used to carry cargo to the space station: “However, I think the future of planetary exploration will continue to be dominated by robot probes which will be spread throughout the solar system. You can imagine robot fabricators mining the asteroids and building large structures in space or on the Moon.” From this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station – claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory – as “an orbital turkey”. No important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value. Manned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in which the agency would return to the Moon then head on to Mars. A few days later, Nasa revealed it was making major cutbacks in its programmes of unmanned research in astronomy because they “do not clearly support the goals of the president’s vision for space exploration”. In other words, to support manned missions science projects were cut back. Even worse, says Weinberg, was the example of the US Superconducting Super-Collider, which was designed to study the structure of matter by crashing sub-atomic particles into each other at colossal energies. Its 12bn construction, in Texas, was cancelled in 1993 because Congress decided the US could not build the SSC and the International Space Station, of which the US was the main supporter of funds, at the same time. So it chose to build the space station, mainly for political reasons. This left Europe free to build its own Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, Geneva, a decade later, where scientists discovered the Higgs Boson in 2013 and are set to begin the search for dark matter and other exotic particles when the LHC reopens next year after a refit. By contrast, the US ended up with that “orbital turkey”, a decision described by Weinberg as a tragic mistake. “The only real technology that the space station has produced concerns the technology of keeping humans alive in space – which is a senseless and circular process if you realise there is no point in having humans in space,” he said. So are science and manned spaceflight virtually incompatible? No, says Crawford. For a start, the idea of robot efficiency is a myth, he says, as there is no substitute for putting a person into space to get things done. “Just consider Philae,” he said. “It did bounce when it landed on comet 67P and in the end only carried out a couple of days’ work – albeit very, very important work – before it stopped working. By contrast, if we had had a bigger mission, with humans on board, the pilot would have been able to land it expertly on that tricky terrain. “There would have been no bouncing. Instrument packages would then have been left on the surface while samples of rock, soil and ice from the comet would have been brought back to Earth so they could be studied in detail and at leisure in laboratories. That’s what you get with a manned mission.” The difference in scientific return rates from manned and unmanned missions is vividly illustrated by the Apollo 17 mission, flown by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972, and the robot rover Opportunity which, in 2004, was dropped on to the surface of Mars and has been exploring ever since, said Crawford. “Apollo 17 spent three days on the Moon while its astronauts made journeys across the lunar surface that totalled 31 kilometres,” he said. “They also drilled a three-metre hole into the surface, the deepest made in an object outside Earth, left a range of instrument packages behind them, and then brought back a 76kg of rock back to Earth. “Opportunity took 10 years before it managed to run up a travel total of 31km. More to the point, it returned no samples of any kind, did no drilling and returned only limited data.” The contrast between the scientific returns of the two approaches is revealed by examining the number of scientific papers based on the Apollo missions, says Crawford. These vastly outnumber the papers produced from all the robot missions that have been carried out on the Moon and Mars. And the number of publications based on Apollo sample is still rising. “Its scientific legacy has been far greater than any other mission we have made to another world,” said Crawford. It was a legacy that was bought at a considerable price, however. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s cost 25bn –more than 100bn today. From this perspective, manned missions are more than 100 times more expensive than robot missions, it is calculated. In the early days of spaceflight, there was little alternative to putting humans in spacecraft. But now robotics has achieved an advanced status and is constantly becoming more sophisticated. Martian rovers can navigate rocky terrains, drill holes and analyse soil samples – using 20th-century technology. “Just consider the Rosetta mission,” argues Rees. “It was designed using 1990s technology – when mobile phones were the size of bricks. Now they are compact and contain a wide array of different functions. Imagine what Rosetta would have been able to do if it had been built from that technology. Imagine what future robot spacecraft will be able to do.” Supporters of manned spaceflight, such as Professor Martin Barstow, of Leicester University, accept human flights are much more expensive but say they are justifiable because they are much, much more effective than robot missions: “Consider Mars. You could get robots to scrape its surface and send back material to Earth, but if you want to hunt down the few places that might still support primitive life you will need to send humans. Only they possess the necessary intuition for that kind of task.” Others point to the inspirational effects of putting men in space. In the 1960s astronauts such as Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong stimulated youngsters into careers in science because manned flights create heroes who spark an interest in technology. But again this claim is disputed. If a classroom today displays space photographs, these are more likely to be glorious images of stars and galaxies taken by the Hubble space telescope than pictures of astronauts. “It’s the robot probe that captures interest today,” said Rees. “The only time an astronaut makes news is when a space station toilet gets blocked.” In short, the jury is still out over the future of humans in space. However, one thing is clear: we may one day return to other worlds, like the Moon and maybe Mars, but current global economic problems suggest these trips will happen later rather than sooner. Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly in space when he orbited the Earth in his Vostok spacecraft on 12 April 1961. His mission was followed by a series of flights - by the US and the Soviet Union - of larger and larger capsules. These culminated in the lunar landings of the US Apollo programme in the late 60s and early 70s. The 12 men who landed on the Moon on Apollo spacecraft are the only humans to have walked on another world. After the Apollo programme was brought to a premature close, largely due to lack of public interest in the US, America concentrated its efforts on constructing a fleet of reusable space shuttles. These were intended to become the nation’s primary means of launching payloads into orbit and were to be launched once a week when fully operational according to Nasa’s ambitious timetable. The first shuttle, Columbia, was launched on 12 April 1981. Thirty years later the fleet was retired after a total of only 135 flights - including two catastrophic accidents which destroyed the shuttles Challenger and Columbia and killed each of their seven-person crews. Since then, the only craft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station has been Russia’s Soyuz space capsule. At the same time the Chinese have pursued their own manned spaceflight programme, which began in 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space programme after orbiting the Earth 14 times in his Shenzhou 5 capsule, making China the third country to independently send humans into space.

Given the question: Information:  - A symptom (from Greek , \\"accident, misfortune, that which befalls\\", from , \\"I befall\\", from - \\"together, with\\" and , \\"I fall\\") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic.  - Primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia is a special form of polydipsia . It is usually associated with a patient 's increasing fluid intake due to the sensation of having a dry mouth . When the term \`\` psychogenic polydipsia '' is used , it implies that the condition is caused by mental disorders . However , the dry mouth is often due to phenothiazine medications used in some mental disorders , rather than the underlying condition . Some forms of primary polydipsia are explicitly characterized as nonpsychogenic .  - Thirst is the craving for fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink. It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance. It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as salt. If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, the brain signals thirst.  - Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek \\"very thirsty\\", which is derived from (\\"much, many\\") + (\\"thirst\\"). Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds.    What is the relationship between 'primary polydipsia' and 'disease'? The answer is:","output":"Primary polydipsia is a specific form of polydipsia characterized by excessive thirst and increased fluid intake, often driven by the sensation of having a dry mouth. Although it can be caused by mental disorders or can have non-psychogenic origins, it is usually considered a symptom rather than a disease itself. It is related to disease in the sense that it can be an indicator or reflection of an underlying condition or unusual state affecting the body's fluid balance or the secretion of osmolites like salt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe managed to buy his own farm near Balcarce within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. His father, Loreto, emigrated to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia Deramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.  Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.  The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact?, what is it ?

Article: -For five days, Edmonton's Downtown Park is transformed into one huge stage where artists are able to share their talents, and where people are able to celebrate  and enjoy themselves. Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating   the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \\"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,\\" Riedel said. \\"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue   for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a 2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close. The Edmonton Folk Music Festival begins on Wednesday, Aug. 4 with Van Morrison playing the special donation fund   concert, and will finish up on Sunday, Aug. 8.

Write highlights for this article: For an hour or so, Diego Costa had the look of a striker who might have been nursing a hamstring problem; one which was preying on his mind, eating away at confidence and preventing him from turning his dial to full power. Then he crashed a header past Villa keeper Brad Guzan to score Chelsea’s second goal — his eighth in seven games this season — created the third for Willian and, with Chelsea’s opponents beaten, left the field to another standing ovation. Jose Mourinho’s team continue to forge ahead at the top of the Premier League. They have won from the front before and are shaping up as if in the mood to do it again. Yet the lingering concerns over Costa’s fitness will stop anyone getting carried away in west London. Chelsea striker burst into life with a crashing header on the hour and was the catalyst for another in his side's comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge. CHELSEA 4-2-3-1: Courtois 6.5; Ivanovic 7, Cahill 5.5, Terry 6, Azpilicueta 6; Fabregas 7, Matic 7; Willian 7.5, Oscar 7 (Mikel 77), Hazard 6 (Schurrle 68, 6); Costa 7 (Remy 81). Subs not used: Cech, Luis, Zouma, Drogba, Remy. Bookings: Cahill, Fabregas. Manager: Jose Mourinho 7. ASTON VILLA 4-5-1: Guzan 6.5; Hutton 6, Senderos 6, Baker 6, Cissokho 6; Richardson 6 (Bent 69, 5), Cleverley 6.5, Westwood 6.5, Delph 7, Weimann 5 (N’Zogbia 69, 5); Agbolahor 7. Subs not used: Given, Clark, Bacuna, Sanchez, Grealish. Bookings: Cleverley, Senderos. Manager: Paul Lambert 6. Without him, they lose their cold spearhead. While he is fit and tormenting centre-halves they seem well-armed to charge clear. Loic Remy replaced Costa for the last 10 minutes, as Mourinho turned his thoughts to Tuesday’s game against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League and wondered whether he can risk him from the start in Portugal. Mourinho’s team remain unbeaten this season. They have dropped only two points from six games. After Sporting, they play Arsenal at home and Mourinho knows his striker must be handled with extreme care. ‘He is doing almost nothing [between games],’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning. ‘He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence.’ ‘If he doesn’t go to the national team, and stays here for 15 days of treatment, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and top for national team. We can’t do anything. I can’t speak to the Spain manager.’ If there was any cause for complaint yesterday, it might have been that the manager would have liked the points to be secure sooner, especially as it had started so well, when Oscar fired in a seventh-minute opener, a goal owing everything to the persistence of Willian. Branislav Ivanovic slid a pass to the latter, who forced Guzan into a save but the rebound spilled kindly to Willian, who spotted Oscar unmarked. From seven yards, Oscar swept in his first Premier League goal of the season. Willian went close soon after but the visitors responded. Chelsea forward Oscar points someone out in the Stamford Bridge crowd after scoring the opener against Aston Villa. Oscar met the loose ball parried down by Villa keeper Brad Guzan to slot home and give the hosts an expected lead.

Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor shoots to no avail against Chelsea. Aly Cissokho almost turned a shot on target when Chelsea failed to clear a corner and Gary Cahill was booked for tripping Gabriel Agbonlahor after being turned and left on the turf by the Villa striker. It was the home team, however, who dominated both in terms of possession and unconverted chances, defied as they were by wasteful finishing, solid defending and good goalkeeping. For almost an hour Costa had lacked some of his usual menace. Twice, either side of half time, he was found in front of goal and twice Guzan saved without fuss. The sequence ended in the 59th minute. Cesar Azpilicueta delivered the cross from the left, clipped towards the near post for Costa, who climbed above Nathan Baker and this time beat Guzan for power. This was the goal to sink Villa. They had set up to play on the counter-attack and there was plenty to admire about their spirit and energy. Fabian Delph impressed in an English midfield trio with Ashley Westwood and Tom Cleverley and almost equalised in the second half with a shot from distance. ‘If you told me we would take three points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, I would probably have taken it,’ said Villa manager Paul Lambert. ‘It’s tough and we’re up against Manchester City next. ’ Despite the quality of the opposition, it is back-to-back 3-0 defeats for Villa and their 1-0 win at Anfield on September 13 loses its gloss with each subsequent game Liverpool fail to win. Villa are still without captain Ron Vlaar and striker Christian Benteke and a positive start to the campaign has taken a turn for the worse since the club was struck by a virus last week. And yesterday Lambert was left to reflect on chances not taken when they trailed 1-0; Baker headed a good one over from a free-kick and Lambert said: ‘When you get a chance you have to score. It’s hard to come here at the best of times. Chelsea will be close to winning the title and the Champions League.’ By the end, however, Villa had managed only one shot on target and Thibaut Courtois celebrated his second clean sheet of the season. Chelsea pressed on after the second goal. Cissokho recovered well to clear off his own line from Oscar but Willian then grabbed the goal his performance deserved by scoring from Costa’s rebound. This was enough for Mourinho. With a three-goal lead, off came Costa to be wrapped in cotton wool. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page. Costa rises above Villa's Nathan Baker to head home Chelsea's second goal. A flying Guzan (right) is helpless as Costa's header crashes into the net for 2-0.

Willian was outstanding throughout, wreaking havoc on the Aston Villa defence. Brazil star Willian was rewarded for his good work with a 79th minute tap-in for 3-0. Willian buries his simple chance in the back on Guzan's net. The midfielder had every reason to smile after a productive day out at Stamford Bridge.","output":"In this article, it talks about a soccer game between Chelsea and Aston Villa. Diego Costa, a player for Chelsea, scored a goal, making the score 2-0. Later in the game, Willian scored another goal, making the final score 3-0.

One such entrepreneur is Kathy Ku, a 24-year-old woman who has been making waves, and quite literally, as the founder of Spouts of Water - an organization that provides affordable, efficient, and sustainable ceramic water filters to communities in Uganda. From her dorm room beginnings to her team's current work in clean water access, let's take a closer look at Kathy's journey and how she is changing lives in Uganda. Kathy Ku's Story Born and raised in the United States, Kathy Ku took a deep dive into the world of clean water access in 2010 when she first visited Uganda during her senior year in high school. Exposed to the crippling effects of the lack of access to clean water in rural Ugandan communities, a seed was planted in her heart. As she pursued her undergraduate degree in Physics and Environmental Science at Harvard University, the idea to provide a sustainable solution to the crisis only blossomed further. The Birth of Spouts of Water With the development of her senior thesis on affordable ceramic water filters as the starting point, in 2013, Kathy, alongside two close friends, embarked on a journey to make a significant difference in Uganda's water crisis. Together, they founded Spouts of Water - a social enterprise that designs, manufactures, and distributes high-quality, locally-produced ceramic water filters. The ceramic filters require no electricity to run, making them suitable for rural households that often lack access to electricity. Impact on Ugandan Communities Spouts of Water’s primary objective is to provide clean, safe, and accessible drinking water to Ugandan households. These ceramic water filters have been proven to effectively remove 99.9% of bacteria from contaminated water sources. By directly addressing the root cause of waterborne diseases and illness, Spouts of Water has had a remarkable impact in the lives of Ugandan communities. Apart from ensuring access to clean water, the organization has created an employment ecosystem within Uganda. As they source raw materials and labor from local communities, this young enterprise has become instrumental in supporting families with steady income and, in turn, creating a sustainable economy. The team at Spouts of Water is committed not only to providing clean water, but also to empowering the people of Uganda. An Inspiring and Sustainable Leadership Model At the helm of Spouts of Water, Kathy Ku's inspiring and sustainable leadership playbook has become a beacon of hope for countless young entrepreneurs. By focusing on creating a local and sustainable solution, Kathy shows how a small team can efficiently address a significant issue such as water scarcity in a developing country. Kathy has been instrumental in raising over 300,000 in seed capital, which has spurred Spouts of Water to distribute filters to more than 140,000 people across Uganda till now. Spouts also collaborates with various NGOs and government initiatives for further enhancement of the outreach of clean water. Future Prospects Kathy Ku's aspirations do not stop at Uganda. As the team at Spouts of Water works relentlessly to widen their impact, they envision catering to other developing countries in need of a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective solution to the challenges of water contamination. Conclusion Successfully carving a niche in the area of social entrepreneurship, Kathy Ku is a shining example of how young innovators can and are making a difference. With passion, determination, and ingenuity, the Dorm Room CEO has transformed her college room dreams into a sustainable reality that is positively impacting the lives of tens of thousands of people in Uganda and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident occurred after a heated argument between Minaj and a man with whom she was sharing the room. The police reports detail that the escalating argument eventually led to the man forcefully shoving a suitcase across Minaj's chin. This resulted in a noticeable cut to the rapper's lower lip. It is unclear from the reports the nature of the disagreement or what prompted the physical altercation in the otherwise serene Dallas hotel. Authorities were alerted, and police promptly arrived at the scene. They noted Minaj's visible injury and initiated the necessary procedures to address the situation. Their primary concern was the immediate safety and well-being of the individuals involved, as well as gathering information that could potentially aid an ongoing investigation regarding the event. Despite the unfortunate incident, Minaj decided not to file a complaint against the man at the center of the controversy. Her decision not to turn her situation into a legal matter is somewhat reflective of her preference for privacy and keeping her personal affairs out of the public view as much as possible. Minaj, while speaking to the police, emphasized that her relationship with the man in question was purely platitudinal. She clarified that they were \\"only friends\\", and not involved romantically. This statement seems to be a clear attempt by the artist to downplay speculation and potential gossip surrounding the incident. Incidents like these shed a light on the harsh reality of interpersonal conflicts, and the potential for violence, even among individuals in high-profile positions. It also re-iterates the importance of conflict resolution techniques and maintaining a healthy understanding amongst friends. Although Minaj opted to handle the issue privately rather than taking legal action, it doesn't diminish the seriousness of the occurrence. Such incidents can cause not only physical harm but can also have mental health implications. It is important to highlight that no individual, celebrity or not, should have to tolerate any form of violence. Nicki Minaj is one of the most recognized names in the global hip-hop scene, known for her riveting lyrics and vibrant personality. These recent events have undoubtedly shaken her fans worldwide, but they also respect her wish for privacy. As for the artist herself, it is hoped that she is able to recover quickly from this unfortunate incident and continue to make strides in her music career. Minaj’s decision to remain silent legally is being respected, but the incident underscores the unfortunate reality that nobody is exempt from potentially violent situations, regardless of their fame or status. While the events pertaining to the dispute in the Dallas hotel room unfold, listeners worldwide await the renowned artist's return to the microphone, ready to embrace her unapologetic and fierce artistry once more."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence that is either in the Yoruba language or the English language.

In recognition of its history , its economic importance and its administrative success , Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951 . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement or rewording of a paragraph or text in order to articulate its meaning in different words or in a more clear and understandable manner. In the context of the two provided sentences, the same information is being expressed, but with varying word placement.   To break it down: The first sentence, \\"Cambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition of its history, economic importance, and administrative success\\", is saying that 1951 was the year in which Cambridge became officially recognized as a city due to its historical significance, economic impact, and effective administration. The second sentence, \\"In recognition of its history, its economic importance and its administrative success, Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951\\", is stating the same context. The difference is the order in which it's presented: it starts with the reasons (its history, economic importance, and administrative success), and then mentions what resulted from those qualities (Cambridge was granted city rights in 1951). Because both sentences are structured differently but communicate the same meaning, one can say they are paraphrases of each other. The intent or meaning isn't changed, only the method of delivering the same information, which is the essence of a paraphrase. It's important to note that \\"city charter\\" and \\"city rights\\" may not be exactly synonymous depending on specific legal contexts, but generally, in this case, they are used to indicate the status of being officially recognized as a city."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.

In fact, they warn, drinking too much water could be, in certain cases, harmful. In a study, Dr Stanly Goldfarb and Dr Dan Negoianu, both of the Renal, Electrolyte and Hypertension Division at the University of Pensylvania, the United States, have denied the popular belief that drinking a lot of water clears body toxins better, improves skin, and helps reduce weight. Dr Goldfarb and Dr Negoianu say that they found little proof to back the public opinion that drinking 8 glasses of water every day benefits health. At the same time, they fond little proof of harm in drinking 8 glasses of water every day. It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports. The study at the University of Pennsylvania also examined reports that some people experienced increased headaches when their consumption of water was low. In one small study, which the doctors reviewed, the group drinking the most water reported fewer headaches than the control group, \\"but the difference in the number of headaches was o small between the two groups as to be considered unimportant.\\" The researchers concluded that there is no scientific proof to support that average, healthy people need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each each day. The website medheadines.com says that, according to an Indian doctor, drinking too much water is harmful. If water enters the body more quickly than it can be removed, problems can occur.

Officers found the teen sleeping in a tent over the weekend outside a local college. Instead of giving him a ticket for trespassing, the officers listened to his story – and that’s where this amazing story begins. © 2018 Cox Media Group.      Barley, a homeless college student, told the officers he had ridden his little brother’s bike six hours from Conyers to Barnesville to register for classes for his second semester of college. He had two duffel bags carrying all he owned and 2 gallons of water as he rode through the heat of a Georgia summer.      Problem is, the Gordon State College campus dorms don’t open until August, so Barley pitched a tent in some bushes on campus and prepared to spend the next few weeks there, with nothing more than a box of cereal to eat.      [READ: Teen who biked six hours to college: ‘I thank God every day']      Barley spent the day job-searching and had just returned to his tent Saturday night when officers responded to a report of someone sleeping in a tent on campus. They told Barley to come out with his hands up, but the officers quickly realized that something wasn’t right. They sat down with Barley, who told them his story.      The biology major, who dreams of going to medical school one day, told the officers he thought the bushes on campus would be a much safer place for him to sleep than staying in his tent in Conyers.      \\"We can’t allow you to stay here, but I have somewhere you can stay.”      “He was so understanding and he said, ‘I definitely I applaud you for doing this. We can’t allow you to stay here, but I have somewhere you can stay,’” Barley told Channel 2 Action News.      TRENDING STORIES:      Without a second thought, the officers took him to a local motel and paid for his next two nights.      “The stuff that’s happening with police officers, I am black and he didn’t care what color I was. He just helped me, and that meant a lot,” Barley said.      That could be the end of this story, but it was only just the beginning.      The officer's wife posted the story on a Barnesville community Facebook page and hundreds of people -- including Casey Blaney -- stepped up to help.      “I was shocked by how much support people will give from Lamar County and counties all over and even people from across the country that I’ve never met just wanted to help so much in my life. I was just so shocked and grateful,” Barley said.      \\"People from across the country that I’ve never met just wanted to help so much in my life. I was just so shocked and grateful.”      Blaney and the motel owner paid for him to stay in his room until he can get into the dorms, which are allowing him to move in early -- on Monday. A local pizzeria, DB's Pizzeria, hired him on as a dishwasher.      Owner Debbie Adamson said she saw his story on Facebook and knew immediately that she wanted to help. © 2018 Cox Media Group.      “I created a position for him before he walked in my door. I didn’t know his name. I didn’t know the color of his skin. I didn’t care. I’ve been there so I guess I had a soft spot for anyone who is that determined to succeed in life,” she said.      Adamson, who’s been through several struggles in her life as well, says they plan to keep him employed and eventually teach him to cook the pizza, while working around his school schedule.      “The most shocking part is so many people coming to help a stranger, because honestly in today’s society this sounds like a scam,” Barley said about his story. Casey Blaney posted this photo of Fred on Facebook with a new bike and new shoes. © 2018 Cox Media Group.      People have donated clothes, school supplies, shoes, a new bike and they are working to get him a car. People have also stepped up to take care of his dental and medical needs. Blaney created a Facebook page called Success For Fred and also started a GoFundMe page that’s raised nearly 9,000 in two days.      But Barley says despite all of that, for which he is extremely grateful, it’s the people that mean the most.      “Some of the gifts aren’t as important as the friends I’ve made. More important than everything -- the clothes, the shoes -- the relationships mean so much more to me,” he said.      “Some of the gifts aren’t as important as the friends I’ve made.\\"      One of those connections is Amber Shoemake, who lost her son Leland to a rare brain infection last year. She says she felt an instant need to help Fred. \\"God bless this sweet guy. Proud to call him a friend,\\" Amber Shoemake wrote about Fred Barley. © 2018 Cox Media Group.      “It’s sad because we would do anything to have our child with us, and for him to just be out there with no family, it completely broke my heart,” she said.      Barley plans to attend church with Shoemake and her family on Sunday.      He says God has been the driving force that keeps him going.      TRENDING STORIES:      “The Bible says, ‘You can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,’ so I know I can,” he said. “My legs are working. Millions of people walk and bike to work every day. I definitely think I can bike a couple hours to get to my future.”      Thursday, Barley recorded a video message to thank everyone who's helped him.      © 2018 Cox Media Group. ||||| Notice      You must log in to continue. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A 19-year-old homeless college student in Georgia, Fred Barley, biked for six hours to reach his college and slept in a tent until dorms opened for the semester.

Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit  .  Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\".

If they don't have the marks to get into their first choice of institution, Clearing tells them about places available at other universities, though they might have to read another subject.

Some sources say six students have applied for each remaining undergraduate university place. The British university admissions service, UCAS, says up to a quarter of this year's university applicants --- almost 190,000 people --- still don't have a place on a degree course. That's a rise of over 46,000 students from last year. Faced with these figures, some British students might be thinking of an interesting alternative: studying abroad. The University of Nottingham, for example,is offering places at its campuses in Ningbo, near Shanghai, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Students here can gain University of Nottingham degrees in business, accounting, engineering and English. Similarly, the University of Bolton says it has 'unlimited' places at its campus in the United Arab Emirates.

So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

His latest creations range from virtual shopping malls and electronic ticketing to digital insurance and security. Read also: Tech whiz brings gift of computers to","output":"African schools Chinery-Hesse's ambitious goal is to create an interconnected Africa through technology, increasing access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for everyone. His projects have been gaining recognition worldwide, resulting in both financial support and collaboration from global tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM. One of his recent ventures is the launch of an e-commerce platform called ShopAfrica53. This initiative aims to provide a marketplace for local African entrepreneurs to showcase their products and services to a global audience, thereby driving economic growth and development across the continent. ShopAfrica53 offers a user-friendly interface for sellers to manage their merchandise, simplify payments, and automate shipping logistics, all essential components to creating thriving online enterprises. Beyond the realm of e-commerce, Chinery-Hesse is determined to bridge the digital divide that many African countries are facing. Through partnerships with international organizations and leading tech companies, he has introduced several tech-focused educational programs. These initiatives aim to provide African school children and college students with access to state-of-the-art computer labs, training, and mentorship, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to the digital economy. Furthermore, Chinery-Hesse has been instrumental in creating employment opportunities in the technology sector for African youth. He argues that, despite the continent's rapid population growth, it can harness this as an advantage rather than a hindrance. A skilled, youthful workforce would lead to increased productivity and innovation, driving economic progress and uplifting entire communities out of poverty. One of the ways Chinery-Hesse has been able to create these employment opportunities is through collaborations with major international tech firms that outsource IT services, software development, and data processing to local African companies. This, in turn, has led to more investment in the local tech industry, empowering African entrepreneurs and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration. It is evident that Chinery-Hesse's dedication to developing and promoting African technological advancements is having a significant impact on the continent. As a result, global technology companies, international aid organizations, and regional governments are taking notice, expressing interest in supporting and partnering with his initiatives.  By leveraging the power of digital technology, Herman Chinery-Hesse is creating a brighter future for millions of Africans. As Africa's \\"father of technology,\\" his innovative solutions are proving to be catalysts for change, connecting people and resources across the continent and beyond. Amidst the increasing acknowledgment of his efforts, Chinery-Hesse insists that the work has just begun, and there's much more to achieve. With the continued support of governmental and private institutions, he hopes to accelerate Africa's journey towards technological prowess, ultimately contributing to the eradication of poverty and improving the quality of life for all African citizens. For Africa to fully realize its digital potential, Chinery-Hesse believes that it requires the support of not only its leaders but also that of international partners and, most importantly, African citizens.

It is the second installment of the \\"Star Wars\\" prequel trilogy, and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz. Can we draw the following conclusion? George Lucas had more influence on the writing of this film than Jonathan Hales.","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that George Lucas likely had more influence on the writing of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones than Jonathan Hales. While we cannot definitively confirm this without further evidence, several factors can be considered to make this conclusion. 1. Direction and Creatorship: George Lucas is not only the director of the film but also the creator of the Star Wars franchise. As the original mind behind the Star Wars universe, Lucas was responsible for crafting its core elements, themes, and characters. This foundational knowledge and insight could have allowed him to have a greater influence on the script, even though he shared writing credits with Jonathan Hales. 2. Final Creative Authority: As the director, Lucas was responsible for the creative vision of the film. Directors are often highly involved in the development of a film's story, and as the writer and director, Lucas would likely hold the final say on creative matters. This authority could have provided him with the opportunity to make decisions regarding the script that were ultimately more impactful than Hales' contributions. 3. Prior Experience as Screenwriter: George Lucas has typically played a significant role in the screenwriting process in the Star Wars series. With his experience in writing the original trilogy and Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it is reasonable to assume that Lucas would have been a major creative force in the writing of Attack of the Clones. 4. Jonathan Hales' Collaborative Relationship with George Lucas: Although Jonathan Hales was credited as a co-writer for the film, it is unclear how much influence he had on the final script. It is possible that Hales' contributions were more in the realm of assisting Lucas with refining ideas and polishing the screenplay, rather than bringing entirely new concepts to the table. In this case, Lucas would still be the primary creative force behind the story and the finished product. With these factors in mind, it seems plausible to conclude that George Lucas had more influence on the writing of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones than Jonathan Hales. However, this conclusion is drawn from the limited information provided and may not be an absolute fact without more detailed analysis of their collaboration and the specific contributions each made to the final script."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Three men who are frequent users of pornography will be introduced to women who star in adult movies to see if they are able to distinguish between fantasy and real life. It is part of a new season of programmes for the station looking at the effect that porn is having on the nation and examining a more realistic view of British sex lives. Date My Porn Star will give porn obssessives the chance to date stars of adult movies to look at the realities of their lives. Pictured is a scene from the documentary. The programmes will also include documentaries about the effect on teenagers of being bombarded with sexual imagery and another which will help ordinary women to get more from their own sex lives. In one programme, Date My Porn Star, film-makers will take a trio of sex film fans to look into their views on the stars they meet, and also how the porn industry works. Channel 4 said it wanted to see 'if it is possible for them to relate to the stars as fully-formed people or whether their porn obsession has fundamentally altered their perception of the opposite sex'. In another programme in the Real Sex Season, called The Week the Women Came, a leading psychosexual therapist Trudy Hannington will try to improve sex lives for women who have struggled to orgasm or have lost their libido. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney will front another film - Porn On The Teenage Brain - to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on their lives and how they relate to people. Daubney famously resigned from the lads’ mag after an epiphany about the effect he felt that peddling soft porn was having on a generation. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney (pictured) will front another film to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on them. And in a documentary called Virgins, young people will discuss the pressures of embarking on a sexual relationship in a world where they are surrounded by images of waxed, enhanced bodies and where porn has become normalised. Ralph Lee, head of factual at Channel 4 said: 'The aim of this season is to get a healthy perspective on sex. 'We live in world where pornography, fantasy and fetish are being considered the norm by many and we want to be very un-British and talk about what really goes on in Britain’s bedrooms.'","output":"A new Channel 4 documentary, \\"Date My Porn Star,\\" offers men who are obsessed with pornography the opportunity to meet the stars of adult films and explore the realities of their lives.

Review: Channing Tatum is trying his hardest to prove he can carry a movie, pretty sure he can stop trying - the only reason this movie works is because of him. Lots of hot looking men can only take it so far, but Tatum's charisma and over all likeability saves the show. I read a lot of advanced press about this movie and was excited to see Riley Keough, as well as Alex Pettyfer... kinda underwhelmed by both of them. Keough was in the movie for a total of five minutes (seems like some of that part may have ended up on the cutting room floor) and Pettyfer is way more stiff than in his other efforts.The worst part? I wanted to knock this down a star just for the terrible acting by Cody Horn. This girl has less expression than Kristen Stewart on a good day! I get that the awkward, hard, girl next door thing is popular among directors these days... but come on, she was terrible and had zero chemistry with Tatum.It's a good movie, just not great. Answer: Answer:","output":"This product review is mixed. Although the reviewer praises Channing Tatum's performance and acknowledges the movie works because of him, they also criticize other aspects like the performances of other actors and the overall quality of the movie.

(CNN) Italian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of death of 26 teenage girls whose bodies were recovered in the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday.      The girls, aged 14-18, are believed to have been migrants from Niger and Nigeria who had embarked on the treacherous route to Europe from Libya over the weekend.      Lorena Ciccotti, Salerno's head of police, told CNN that autopsies would be carried out on Tuesday and that coroners would be investigating whether the girls had been tortured or sexually abused.      Migrants disembark in the harbor of Salerno, Italy on Sunday.      Their bodies were found close to a flimsy rubber dinghy that had all but sunk when rescuers arrived, Ciccotti said. Aid workers had described a grim scene: survivors hanging onto the remains of the vessel as the girls' bodies floated nearby.      Their rescue was one of four separate rescue operations carried out in the Mediterranean over the weekend. In total, 400 people were brought aboard the Spanish vessel Cantabria before disembarking at the Italian port town of Salerno.

There are suspicions that they may have been sexually abused and murdered as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean.      Five migrants are being questioned in the southern port of Salerno.      A Spanish warship, Cantabria, docked there carrying 375 migrants and the dead women, following several rescues.      Twenty-three of the dead women had been on a rubber boat with 64 other people.      Italian media report that the women's bodies are being kept in a refrigerated section of the warship. Most of them were aged 14-18.      Most of the 375 survivors brought to Salerno were sub-Saharan Africans, from Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, The Gambia and Sudan, the daily La Repubblica reports.      Among them were 90 women - eight of them pregnant - and 52 children.      There were also some Libyan men and women on board.      People-smuggling gangs charge each migrant about 6,000 (£4,578) to get to Italy, 4,000 of which is for the trans-Saharan journey to Libya, according to the Italian aid group L'Abbraccio.      Many migrants have reported violence, including torture and sexual abuse, by the gangs.      Read more on migrant crisis:      In the year to 1 November, 150,982 migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat from North Africa, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports.      Of them, 111,552 (nearly 75%) came via the Central Mediterranean route to Italy. The number who died on that route was 2,639, the IOM says.      The others arrived in Greece, Cyprus or Spain. The total is less than half the 335,158 who arrived in the same period of 2016.      Last year the total for Greece was higher than that for Italy.      A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants. ||||| Italy Probes Deaths Of 26 Nigerian Women And Girls At Sea      Enlarge this image toggle caption Paolo Manzo/NurPhoto/Getty Images Paolo Manzo/NurPhoto/Getty Images      Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET Tuesday      The bodies of 26 Nigerian girls and women were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea, and Italian prosecutors are probing whether their deaths are linked to sex trafficking.      \\"Salvatore Malfi, the police prefect of the southern town of Salerno, said the 26 [victims] may have been thrown off their rubber dinghy into the waters of the Mediterranean,\\" NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome. \\"The cause of death appears to be by drowning.\\"      Cantabria, a Spanish warship, brought their bodies to Salerno, Sylvia adds. That ship had carried out other Mediterranean rescues and had 374 rescued migrants on board.      According to the BBC, Italian authorities are questioning five migrants. The broadcaster adds that \\"twenty-three of the dead women had been on a rubber boat with 64 other people.\\"      Agence France Press reports that a spokesman for the EU anti-trafficking force Sofia said \\"another three bodies had been discovered during other life-saving operations in the Mediterranean this week.\\"      Italian media outlets are reporting that the deceased females were mostly between 14 and 18, Sylvia adds. \\"Police Prefect Malfi called this a human tragedy and said his office has appealed to neighboring towns to provide dignified burial for the Nigerian women.\\"      The bodies were lowered in black bags from the ship and placed into coffins, the AFP reports.      It wasn't immediately clear why all the victims are women. The AFP quotes Malfi as saying that sex traffickers typically use different routes. \\"Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' — as they describe them — in one fell swoop,\\" he said, the news agency reported.      Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera recently reported on an uptick in young Nigerian women and girls trafficked into Italy and forced into prostitution.      From January to November of this year, some 111,552 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea, according to the International Organization for Migration, and 2,639 migrants have died along that route.      That's a smaller number than the same area saw in the same period last year, where 159,467 migrants arrived in Italy and 3,615 people died on the route, according to the IOM. A total number of 2,839 have died so far this year along all primary Mediterranean routes.      The Italian aid group L'Abbraccio says that \\"people-smuggling gangs charge each migrant about 6,000 ... to get to Italy, 4,000 of which is for the trans-Saharan journey to Libya,\\" according to the BBC. ||||| The central Mediterranean route from the coast of Libya to Italy is currently the favoured route of undocumented migrants, most of whom are Nigerian (AFP Photo/STRINGER)      Rome (AFP) - The bodies of 26 women who drowned attempting the perilous crossing from Libya to Europe were brought to Italy on Sunday, where investigators launched a murder inquiry.      A seemingly endless line of black plastic body bags were lowered by crane from a Spanish ship onto the portside in Salerno, southern Italy, where they were placed in coffins and loaded onto waiting hearses.      Twenty-three of the women died on Friday after the inflatable dinghy they were travelling on sank, and their bodies were recovered by the Spanish ship Cantabria, which was operating as part of the EU anti-trafficking force Sophia.      A Sophia spokesman told AFP another three bodies had been discovered during other life-saving operations in the Mediterranean this week, and transferred to the Cantabria as it headed towards Italy with its grim cargo.      There was no immediate explanation as to why all the dead were women, though the crossing is riskier for them.      For every five men who drown in the rubber boats trying to cross the Mediterranean, six women also die, according to migrant expert Sine Plambech, adjunct professor at Columbia University.      They can have poorer swimming skills compared to men and their attempts to save their children often lead to their drowning, as does the heavier clothing they wear, he said      - 'A tragedy' -      \\"It's a tragedy. The prosecutor's office will begin looking into it immediately,\\" Salerno's prefect Salvatore Malfi said.      \\"We will need to see whether there are suspects to concentrate on or whether the murder inquiry will proceed against persons unknown,\\" he said.      Investigators would be looking for signs of violence against the women, who are believed to have been Nigerian.      \\"They were on a dinghy that was also carrying men,\\" Malfi told Italian media in response to fears the doomed vessel may have been a sex-trade boat carrying victims destined for prostitution.      \\"The sex trafficking routes are different. Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' -- as they describe them -- in one fell swoop,\\" he said.      The Cantabria was also carrying 375 migrants rescued from the waves, including 116 women -- nine of whom were heavily pregnant.      According to Italy's interior ministry, more than 111,700 people have reached the country by sea in the first 10 months of 2017, 30 percent down on the previous year.      Despite the drop, traffickers are still sending migrant boats out into the Mediterranean: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Friday that more than 2,560 migrants had been saved over four days.      In all, 2,839 people have died while attempting the crossing so far this year, it said. ||||| Geneva – IOM, the UN Migration Agency, reports that 150,982 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2017 through 1 November, with about 75 per cent arriving in Italy and the remainder divided between Greece, Cyprus and Spain. This compares with 335,158 arrivals across the region through the same period last year.      2017 marks the fourth straight year migrant arrivals to Europe by sea reached the 150,000-person benchmark, but it is not the earliest time in the year that threshold was reached. In 2016 the Mediterranean region hit that benchmark in early March, and in July in 2015.      During the calendar year 2015, there were single months when as many as 150,000 migrants entered by sea, principally through Greece.      Nonetheless, this year may shape up as the first year since 2013 that Mediterranean sea crossings by migrants fell short of the 200,000 threshold. Just counting arrivals in Italy and Greece, totals were around 204,000 in 2014 and doubling to 355,000 in 2016 after cresting past one million (1,007,000) in 2015. (See chart below.)      IOM Rome reported Thursday (2 November) that 260 migrants were rescued on Tuesday, 31 October, in five different rescue operations, while another 975 were rescued the following day (1 November) in 12 separate rescue operations carried out by Italian and international ships. The remains of eight victims were recovered in waters north of the Libyan coast.      IOM Athens’ Kelly Namia reported Thursday (2 November) of at least two incidents this week off the islands of Lesvos requiring search and rescue operations. The Hellenic Coast Guard rescued 147 migrants and transferred them to the two islands.      Over 12,400 men, women and children have entered Greece by sea from waters of the Eastern Mediterranean since 1 August, or more migrants than entered during all of 2017’s first seven months. Namia further reported that nearly 800 migrants or refugees entered Greece by sea during the last week of October, bringing migrant sea arrivals to Greek territory to 23,826 for the year so far. (See chart below.)      IOM Cyprus’ Dimitrios Tsagalas reported that 34 migrants of Arab origin were picked up in the village of Pyla at Larnaca District this past weekend, in what appears to be growing use of a new pathway into Europe. Cyprus media reported these migrants departed Turkey’s Mersin port by boat Saturday (28 October), reaching Cyprus without detection and travelling by truck to Pyla, a village in the UN Buffer Zone, before crossing into the Republic. All migrants have since been transferred to Purnara’s Reception Centre.      According to Republic of Cyprus authorities, this is the seventh recorded incident of crossing via the UN Buffer Zone in 2017. Authorities have recorded 105 migrants using this route to enter the Republic this year. IOM Cyprus notes that the National Plan “NAFKRATIS” – which deals with the management and provision of help to persons in need – has been activated 15 times in 2017, and that a total of 850 migrants have arrived in Cyprus by boat, nearly three times 2016’s total of 345 migrants (through nine months).      IOM Libya’s Christine Petré reported Thursday that on 31 October, 299 migrants (231 men, 30 women and 29 children) were rescued from one rubber dinghy off the Libyan capital, Tripoli. IOM assisted at the disembarkation point. She reported one woman had to be transferred to a hospital for further medical assistance. The majority of the migrants came from Guinea Conakry, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon and Senegal.      So far in 2017, 19,134 migrants have been rescued or intercepted in Libyan waters, Petré reported.      Worldwide, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP) has recorded the deaths of 4,866 people migrating in 2017 – 16 persons per day – with just over eight weeks remaining in the year.      Deaths in the Mediterranean Sea continue to account for a majority of the world’s migrant fatalities – now up to 2,839 for the year, or nearly 60 per cent of the 2017 total. Last year at this time the region recorded deaths of 4,150 migrants (see chart below).      In the Central Mediterranean this past week, the remains of eight people were recovered Wednesday (1 November) during rescue operations off the coast of Libya. In the Western Mediterranean on Monday (30 October), two young men died after their boat capsized off the coast of Mostaganem in Algeria. The three migrants listed as missing from a shipwreck of 29 October off Tangiers are being counted now as fatalities.      Two accidents were recorded in Europe, near the Italian-Austrian border: one migrant lost his life on 30 October in a vehicle accident on the A23 motorway near Udine, in Italy; and another migrant was hit by a train in Bolzano, Italy, on 1 November. Additionally, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project recorded the first death this year off the coast of the Canary Islands: the remains of one man were recovered near Morro Jable in Fuerteventura on 31 October.      In Southeast Asia, six Rohingya died and one went missing after two boats carrying dozens of people fleeing violence in Myanmar capsized off the coast of Bangladesh over two days: on 31 October, four Rohingya (a woman and three children), drowned when a small wooden fishing boat capsized off Jaliapalong Union, Ukhiya sub-district. This tragedy came a day after (30 October) a boat carrying approximately 30 Rohingya capsized at Sabrang Union, Teknaf sub-district. Two people died and one remains missing.      Since 31 August, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project has recorded the deaths of 249 Rohingya on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.

Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal   signals is basic to the growth and development of language. Question: Frederick's experiment was extreme because   _  . Answer: A:","output":"Frederick's experiment was extreme because it involved preventing the babies from hearing any language at all by instructing the nurses not to speak to them, which resulted in all the babies' deaths within their first year of life. This level of language deprivation was combined with a lack of good mothering, thereby affecting the babies' survival and development."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: We are always using body language in our daily life. When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe  it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'. However, if we do this in France or Belgium, it means 'You're worth zero'. In Greece or Turkey, we should not make this gesture . Or we are thought to be very rude. The meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant 'peace'. However, during World War II, it meant 'victory'. In Greece, it is a very insulting sign. Though the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world, such as smiling and crying.

She had recently moved to the village after her parents inherited a picturesque cottage from her late grandmother. Emily was quick to make friends with the local children, and she discovered that they shared a deep love for adventure. They would often gather after school to explore the woods, the hills, and the nearby lake, creating fond memories as they experienced new sights and sounds. One day, Emily and her friends stumbled upon a mysterious cave hidden in the dense thicket. The entrance was dark and foreboding, enticing them with the alluring prospect of a great adventure. As children filled with curiosity, they couldn't resist the urge to uncover the cave's secrets. Upon entering the cave, they discovered that its walls were adorned with ancient paintings and symbols. The markings seemed to tell a story, perhaps one of treasure and danger hidden within the depths of the cave. The more they ventured, the deeper and more complex the cave's twists and turns became, and their enthusiasm began to wane as a sense of unease grew in their hearts. Determined to follow the adventure to its conclusion, they pushed onward until they found themselves in a cavernous chamber filled with an assortment of dazzling gems and relics of a bygone era. Overcome with a sense of awe, the children couldn't believe their eyes. Could this be the treasure they sought, or was it a clever trap set to ensnare the unwary? Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath them began to tremble. Rocks and debris started to fall from the ceiling, striking fear into their hearts. The cave was beginning to collapse, and they had no idea how to get out. Desperation and panic gripped them as they frantically searched for an exit, the walls of the chamber closing in on them. As they struggled to find their way out, Emily remembered the symbols on the cave walls and recognized a pattern that had eluded her before. Desperate to lead her friends to safety, she instructed them to follow her as she carefully navigated the seemingly endless labyrinth. Their hearts raced as they traversed the hazardous pathways, narrowly avoiding deadly obstacles. Emily's intuition and newfound understanding of the ancient symbols guided them through the darkness and back towards the entrance. Having only faith and trust in their friend, they pressed on. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of fear and chaos, Emily and her friends emerged from the cave, just as the last of the cave's passages collapsed with a thunderous roar. Out in the safety of the warm sunlight, the children hugged each other tightly, tears streaming down their faces. They knew that they had just escaped certain doom, and in the face of overwhelming adversity, their bond of friendship had grown stronger.

When using coconut oil on your hair, choose virgin or unrefined coconut oil. These coconut oils are less processed with no added chemicals, so they contain more nutrients that are beneficial and safer for your hair. High quality coconut oils are pure white when solid and clear when liquid. You can use either a solid or a liquid coconut oil as long as it is high quality. If your coconut oil is in solid form (as most products will be when you purchase them), warm 2 to 8 tablespoons (120 mL) on the stove or in the microwave until the solid has turned into a liquid. Remove the oil from the heat right when it has melted completely–you do not want the oil to get too hot, as you will be applying it to your hair.  The amount you use is entirely based on how much hair you have. If you have short hair that is above your chin, for example, begin with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil. If you have long, thick hair, you may need up to 8 tablespoons (120 mL) to cover your whole head. Before applying the oil to your hair, gently touch the surface of the melted oil with your finger to make sure that it has not gotten too hot. If the oil is uncomfortably hot to the touch, wait a few minutes and test it again. Once the coconut oil has melted, dip your fingers into the oil and gently message it into a section of your hair for about 1 minute. Repeat this until all your hair is covered in the coconut oil.  It might be a good idea to wear clothes that you don’t mind staining with oil, or you can wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. You can also apply the oil to your hair by slowly pouring it onto your head. To avoid making a mess, do this either in the shower or pour slowly while holding your head over the sink. To give the oil enough time to strengthen and add shine to your hair, leave it to rest in your hair for at least 30 minutes. You can leave your hair uncovered, or you can protect your clothes and surroundings by putting on a shower cap, or by lightly wrapping your hair in a towel.  If your hair is particularly dry, you can leave the coconut oil in your hair overnight. To do this, cover your hair with a towel or shower cap. You may also want to cover your pillow with a towel so that the oil does not stain your pillowcase. After leaving the coconut oil to condition your hair for at least 30 minutes, wash it out thoroughly with your regular shampoo. If your hair tends to absorb a lot of product, you may need to shampoo more than once to keep your hair from looking oily after. Coconut oil tends to weigh a bit heavily in hair, so you will likely want to skip using a bottled conditioner for at least one wash after the coconut oil wash. For best results, apply coconut oil to your hair every week. If your hair is particularly damaged or dry, you can use a coconut oil conditioning mask up to 3 times per week. If your hair is oily, however, you will likely want to stick to 1 treatment per week. Summary:","output":"Choose high-quality virgin or unrefined coconut oil for hair, melt the desired amount, apply evenly, and leave it on for at least 30 minutes or overnight before washing out for strengthened, shiny hair."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - Falsetto (Italian diminutive of \\"falso\\", \\"false\\") is the vocal register occupying the frequency range just above the modal voice register and overlapping with it by approximately one octave.  - Vibrato (Italian, from past participle of \\"vibrare\\", to vibrate) is a musical effect consisting of a regular, pulsating change of pitch. It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music. Vibrato is typically characterised in terms of two factors: the amount of pitch variation (\\"extent of vibrato\\") and the speed with which the pitch is varied (\\"rate of vibrato\\").  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Maurice Ernest Gibb, CBE (22 December 1949  12 January 2003) was a British singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer, who achieved fame as a member of the British pop group the Bee Gees. Although his brothers Barry and Robin Gibb were the group's main lead singers, most of their albums included at least one or two Gibb compositions, including \\"Lay It on Me\\", \\"Country Woman\\" and \\"On Time\\". The Bee Gees were one of the most successful rock-pop groups ever. Gibb's role in the group focused on melody and arrangements, providing backing vocal harmony and playing a variety of instruments.  - The Bee Gees  were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their line-up consisted of brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.     What entity does 'run to me ' has the relation 'follows' with?","output":"The information provided does not explicitly mention the song that \\"Run to Me\\" follows in the Bee Gees' discography or on their 1972 album \\"To Whom It May Concern.\\" However, considering that \\"Run to Me\\" is the lead single and the album's first track, it is likely that this song follows the last track of their previous album, \\"Trafalgar,\\" which was released in 1971.

Which one is a better option: 1. appearing for CAT or 2. appearing for GMAT? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"To provide the best advice on whether CAT or GMAT is tougher and which one is a better option, I will first gather information about both exams and compare them based on various factors. Step 1: Research and gather information about the CAT CAT (Common Admission Test) is a national-level entrance exam conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to screen candidates for admission into MBA (Masters in Business Administration) and PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) courses at various management institutions across India. Step 2: Research and gather information about the GMAT GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a standardized global business entrance exam conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). It is primarily created for admissions into international Business schools. However, some Indian institutions also accept GMAT scores for their MBA and PGDM programs. Step 3: Compare difficulty levels The difficulty levels of the CAT and GMAT can be quite subjective. However, some aspects can be compared: 1. CAT often emphasizes more on quantitative aptitude and time management, while GMAT emphasizes verbal and analytical skills. Some students may find quant-heavy CAT more challenging, whereas others may find GMAT more challenging due to a focus on verbal and analytical skills. 2. GMAT includes an Analytical Writing Assessment, which demands good essay writing skills that CAT does not have. It's important to identify your strengths and weaknesses to decide which exam may be more challenging for you. Step 4: Evaluate personal and professional goals The choice between CAT and GMAT comes down to individual preferences, goals, and aspirations.  1. If you aspire to study in a top Indian B-school and are specifically targeting IIMs or other prestigious management institutions in India, CAT would be a better option.  2. If you aim for an international MBA at leading global Business schools, or if you want to keep your options open for both Indian and international schools, GMAT is the better choice. Step 5: Assess the questions The questions you asked, 1. \\"CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?\\" - it compares the difficulty level of the two exams. 2. \\"Which one is a better option: appearing for CAT or appearing for GMAT?\\" - it asks for advice on which exam would suit the individual based on their goals and aspirations.  These questions are not the same, although related. They address different aspects of the decision-making process for choosing between CAT and GMAT. In conclusion, the choice between CAT and GMAT depends on your personal strengths, weaknesses, and long-term goals. Consider these factors and assess which exam aligns better with your aspirations before making a decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases  new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems.

Payable on Death (abbreviated P.O.D.) is a Christian nu metal band formed in 1992 and based in San Diego, California. The band's line-up consists of vocalist Sonny Sandoval, drummer and rhythm guitarist Wuv Bernardo, lead guitarist Marcos Curiel, and bassist Traa Daniels. They have sold over 12 million records worldwide. Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. The band headlined the first annual Spring Jam Fest in May 2011. They appeared on the Rock of Allegiance tour later that summer. On July 25, 2011, the band released a demo of the song \\"On Fire\\" as a free download on their official website.  In October 2011, P.O.D. announced a multi-album artist deal with Razor & Tie. On April 5, 2012, the song \\"Eyez\\" became a free download on the band's website for a limited time. Shortly after, an article on their website stated that \\"Lost in Forever\\" would be the first single from the new album, entitled Murdered Love.  Murdered Love was originally going to be released in June 2012, but was instead pushed back to July 10. The album was produced by Howard Benson, who also produced Satellite and The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. It was described by Curiel as \\"Back to our roots. A little bit of hip hop, a little bit of punk rock, or reggae\\". The band went on tour with Shinedown and Three Days Grace as an opening act.  In a 2012 interview with Broken Records Magazine, Sandoval said that the band had to get their lives back in order and take care of personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely happy about the response the band was getting from fans.  On October 22, 2013, P.O.D. released a deluxe edition of Murdered Love. The album contains the original songs, slightly remixed, along with bonus tracks \\"Find a Way\\", \\"Burn It Down\\", acoustic versions of \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"West Coast Rock Steady\\", a remixed version of \\"On Fire\\", and music videos for \\"Murdered Love\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Higher\\", and \\"Lost In Forever\\".

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.  Question: \\"Before the restoration of Portuguese control, what Portuguese holdings were taken over by the British and the Dutch?\\" Answer: \\"Many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil)\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

However, let's analyze each possible emotional reaction to the information provided by Casey to the parents.  A. Quite mad: If Casey shared information that caused parents to become upset or angry, perhaps it was sensitive or confidential news about their children that they were not expecting or did not want to hear. People might feel mad if the information was perceived as intrusive or offensive. B. Very nice: If Casey shared helpful and supportive information that the parents appreciated, then others might feel happy and appreciative with the effort. The information could have been about resolving a situation, providing solutions, or offering support to the parents. In this scenario, such kind of information could make others feel reassured and positive about the situation.  C. Very sad: If the information shared by Casey was tragic or disheartening, it could make others feel very sad. The news might have involved a disappointing event, an unfortunate happening, or even something that led to a challenging situation.

As the oceanic plate moves across the hotspot, the rising magma creates a series of volcanic islands or seamounts in the process. This movement of the plate leads to the formation of a chain of volcanoes, with the older volcanoes progressively becoming inactive and eroding away as they move farther from the hotspot, while newer volcanoes form closer to it. An example of such a volcanic chain is the Hawaiian Islands, which have been formed as the Pacific Plate moved over the Hawaii hotspot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The principal cities are Fredericton, the capital, Greater Moncton, currently the largest metropolitan (CMA) area and the most populous city, and the port city of Saint John, which was the first incorporated city in Canada and largest in the province for 231 years until 2016.  In the Canada 2016 Census, Statistics Canada estimated the provincial population to have been 747,101, down very slightly from 751,171 in 2011, on an area of almost 73,000 km. The majority of the population is English-speaking of Anglo and Celtic heritage, but there is also a large Francophone minority (31%), chiefly of Acadian origin. It was created as a result of the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 with the capital in Saint John before being moved up river. The name 'New Brunswick' was chosen by King George III despite local recommendations for the name to be 'New Ireland'. The provincial flag features a ship superimposed on a yellow background with a yellow \\"lion passant guardant\\" on red pennon above it.

However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a  .22 rifle. However Holmes manages to escape, and Lestrade and the police arrest Spedding, her gang, and the pygmy. Answer:","output":"Holmes allowed himself to be captured by Spedding and her gang at a nearby fairground."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: -  Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in the kidneys, also known as renal filtration, begins with blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery. The renal artery branches off the aorta, which is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.  When blood reaches the kidneys, it begins its journey through the nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney contains over a million nephrons, made up of a glomerulus, a tiny cluster of capillaries, and a tubule. Within the nephron, the renal filtration process can be broken down into several stages: 1. Glomerular filtration: Blood enters the glomerulus, where high blood pressure forces water, salts, glucose, amino acids, and nitrogenous waste like urea and uric acid out of the blood and into the nearby Bowman's capsule. This process separates the smaller molecules from the larger ones, such as blood cells and proteins that are too large to pass through the tiny capillary walls. 2. Tubular reabsorption: As the fluid, now called the filtrate, passes through the renal tubule, essential nutrients, ions, and water are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the peritubular capillaries. This process maintains the body's electrolyte balance and ensures that vital substances are not lost in the urine.  3. Tubular secretion: Some substances, like hydrogen ions, potassium ions, and certain drugs, are actively secreted from the peritubular capillaries and into the renal tubule. This helps to regulate blood pH and eliminate any unwanted substances from the body. 4. Concentration and dilution of the filtrate: As the filtrate moves through the Loop of Henle, the descending limb allows water to pass out of the filtrate while the ascending limb actively transports salts out of the filtrate and into the surrounding tissue. This concentrates the urine and helps to maintain the appropriate concentration of salts in the body. 5. Collection and excretion: The concentrated filtrate, now considered urine, continues to flow through the distal convoluted tubule, where any last necessary adjustments to the composition of the urine are made. The urine then enters the collecting duct and finally exits the kidney through the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra. In conclusion, the first step of the process is blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery, which carries oxygenated blood to the nephrons. The high blood pressure in the glomerulus forces water, salts, glucose, amino acids, and nitrogenous waste out of the blood and into the Bowman's capsule, effectively starting the renal filtration process. The kidney's exceptional ability to filter waste, prevent the loss of vital substances, and regulate the body's chemical composition makes these organs crucial to maintaining our overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wash the skillet thoroughly: Wash the cast iron with warm water and mild dish soap. Scrub with bristle brush, gentle scouring pad, or mesh sponge if needed.; Answer:","output":"II.

Scrub with bristle brush, gentle scouring pad, or mesh sponge if needed. The correct answer is option II, and here's why: Option I is incorrect because it says to scour the skillet until the area returns to \\"new cast iron.\\" This wording suggests removing the entire seasoning layer, which is not the goal in this process.  Option II is the correct answer because it instructs you to scour the skillet until the area is back to raw cast iron. This means that you are only removing the portions affected by rust while keeping the rest of the seasoning intact. This process ensures that the cast iron skillet maintains the much-appraised non-stick surface that it develops after the seasoning process. After removing the rust, you can re-season the skillet to provide a consistent and protective layer on the skillet's surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Pharrell Williams Takes a Stand on Cheery Musical Ground It can probably all be explained by the hat, the indelible success of Pharrell Williams. The hat, of course, is the signature Vivienne Westwood mountain hat that he wore to the Grammys in January. Sitting atop his head as if it were pasted on with adhesive, the hat — part cowboy, part park ranger — added several inches to his height and several months to his cultural relevance. With one small stroke — almost an afterthought, given that he’d bought the hat several years before — Mr. Williams managed to redraw himself completely. That night, he was a performer, a winner several times over, including for producer of the year, and also a very slick, gentle disruption. But that is Mr. Williams in a nutshell: taking an old idea, something that’s been in currency for quite some time, and, with a touch of panache and a willingness to look slightly out of place, make it seem utterly new. He makes the familiar seem idiosyncratic. Now 40, Mr. Williams has been producing and writing songs for over two decades, first a force in hip-hop and R&B, and later in pop. After a brief lull out of the spotlight, he’s been one of the most transformative music figures of the last year, with his hands on two of 2013’s biggest singles, Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky.” And now there’s “G I R L” (Columbia), his second album as a solo performer. It’s intensely catchy and harmlessly empty, and succeeds largely because of Mr. Williams’s bravery at standing firm on territory no one else is trying to claim. The sunny “G I R L” — which Mr. Williams wrote, produced and sung almost in its entirety — reaches back to the utopian black pop of the ’70s and early ’80s, full of soft funk and cushy soul. It’s an overwhelmingly positive album, cheery in mood and instrumentation, as if Mr. Williams knows something the rest of us do not. Take “Happy,” which first appeared on the soundtrack of “Despicable Me 2” and which is nominated for best original song at the Oscars on Sunday, at which Mr. Williams will also perform. The song is unrelentingly bright, like a peek of unfiltered sun between clouds on an overcast day. “Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof,” Mr. Williams sings. “Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth.” Were you so inclined — and certainly you are not — you could watch the 24-hour video for the song, with guest appearances from Jamie Foxx, Jimmy Kimmel and the rap collective Odd Future, among others. Again, this is 24 literal hours of happiness, punishment-level glee. And yet “Happy,” which is out of lock step with almost the whole of pop music, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Mr. Williams may be the most prominent pop music figure to have identified a bubbling shift away from cynicism in youth culture, or he may be the first person to make adult-contemporary pop that actually sounds contemporary. Either way, he manages to tap into broad pleasures while coming off like a minimalist or an aesthete. There are moments of musical ostentation on “G I R L,” but they are few. Instead, Mr. Williams delivers a gut check of pared-down R&B and disco with almost military rigor. “Lost Queen” is among the highlights — a virtual lullaby, with nods to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” Dance-floor strings pulse vibrantly through “Gust of Wind,” “Gush” and “Marilyn Monroe.” “I Know Who You Are” has the faintest contour of lovers-rock reggae, with Alicia Keys singing dully about empowerment. (In fairness, Ms. Keys’s voice was not built for subtlety.) “Brand New,” with its wanton Jackson 5 horn homage, shows that Mr. Williams hasn’t been too troubled by the lawsuit filed by the heirs of Marvin Gaye, who alleged that “Blurred Lines” was too derivative of Mr. Gaye’s work without proper remuneration. Justin Timberlake sings on this song, and Mr. Williams manages to de-emphasize him, turning an unfair vocal fight into a clear victory for Mr. Williams. None of the ideas on these songs are original, but they are for the most part out of fashion, and therefore Mr. Williams’s boldness and facility with them feels refreshing. The album is a light massage, fingertips gently brushing your back, a reminder of deeper and more nuanced pleasure. Mr. Williams has always been a believer in sketches. Most of the genre-shifting beats he made as half of the Neptunes (alongside Chad Hugo) — Clipse’s “Grindin’,” Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” and so many more — were mere outlines, emphatic in their simplicity. Mr. Williams is an expert at pointing a listener in a direction, then stepping out of the way, confident that the rest of the path is clear. In his music and his public presentation, Mr. Williams glows with an incandescent calm that’s part naïve, part smug — where he is is the only place he can be — and exactly where everyone else should be. The most vital comparison point for “G I R L” may be its opposite, the other extreme black pop album of the last year, Kanye West’s “Yeezus,” a stern album through and through. “G I R L” is in many ways the anti-“Yeezus” (though both albums have a dirty streak). Mr. Williams and Mr. West have grown up in parallel, though Mr. Williams’s ability to transform pop predates Mr. West’s. While Mr. Williams helped set the table for Mr. West’s avant-gardeness, he has never craved it for himself. Instead, he’s satisfied with being contemporary pop’s great reconciler. He has worked with Britney Spears, Mystikal and Hans Zimmer. He was a spirit guide for Miley Cyrus during her recent transition from country-inclined post-Disney upstart to salacious pop phenom. Mr. Williams produced a pair of songs on her album “Bangerz” (RCA), and she returns the favor here with guest vocals on “Come Get It Bae.” As a performer, Mr. Williams is a true chameleon, but he has no natural home. He’s a tremendous accent piece, but can you build a room around him? He has a neutral, almost ahistoric voice. He’s not a powerful singer — so many times on this album, his vocals are thickened, bolstered with harmonies, and so on. His tone is unmistakable, but his force is on loan. And there’s nothing gnomic about his lyrics — coming from almost anyone else, they’d be pilloried for excess simplicity. Plenty of times on this album, he sings lines that are vexing: “ ‘Duck Dynasty’ is cool and all/ But they got nothing on the female’s call,” on “Hunter.” On “Marilyn Monroe,” he sings lyrics that sound like Mad Libs: “We cannot help who/We’re attracted to/So let’s all dance and elevate each other.” Instead, where Mr. Williams excels is in pacing and rhythm, and finding pockets of delivery that feel intuitive, or at least lined so deeply with historical memory that they’re instantly familiar and comforting. He sings in a percussive manner, full of vocal stabs, and his voice congeals easily into a sweet coo, precise and seemingly effortless. Mr. Williams has released one other solo album — “In My Mind” (Star Trak/Interscope), in 2006. This was a different Pharrell — mostly a rapper, a wry braggart, bawdy and thrilled to get away with it. He hadn’t yet transcended category. But Mr. Williams has shifted the culture in a fashion similar to “G I R L” once before. As the Neptunes were reaching their commercial peak as pop and hip-hop producers, they chose to spend that clout by effectively reformatting (with the addition of a vocalist) into a rock band, N.E.R.D. The debut N.E.R.D. album, “In SearchOf ...” (Virgin), originally released in 2001, was a brilliant hodgepodge of rock, soul, electro, hip-hop and more, the tablet on which Mr. Williams laid out his polyglot vision. It had no clear precursor, and no clear peers. And though it wasn’t a breakthrough commercial success, it’s been a quiet influence in the years since. Like “G I R L,” and like that hat, that, too, was something dug out from the back of the closet, a backward look that turned out to be the way forward.","output":"Pharrell Williams is a famous singer who has been making music for over 20 years. He wore a unique hat at the Grammy Awards, which made him even more popular. His latest album, \\"G I R L,\\" is a mix of old ideas in music, but makes it feel new and fresh. It has a happy and positive vibe, making it different from much of pop music today. Even though he's not a powerful singer, his sense of rhythm and pacing in songs make them catchy and fun.

Q: Question: what is the main source of power in today's america factories?? Would \\"These advantages are global.\\" be a reasonable answer? Options: (a). No (b). Yes The answer is:","output":"(a). No The main source of power in today's American factories is not suitably addressed by the statement \\"These advantages are global.\\" This answer does not provide any information about the actual source of power that drives American industries. A detailed answer to the question would be as follows: The main source of power in American factories today comes from a mix of energy sources, including fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear power, and renewable sources. The most common among these sources is electricity, which is generated from various means and serves as an essential utility for most industries in the United States. For many years, coal and natural gas were the dominant sources of power for American factories, providing reliable and affordable power options for industry. However, recent years have seen a shift towards more sustainable energy sources due to environmental concerns, government regulations, and technological advancements. Currently, natural gas has become a more prominent player in the American energy mix since it is a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal. The increased production and availability of shale gas have contributed to the increase in natural gas use. Moreover, we see an increasing focus on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. These energy sources are beneficial for the environment and provide stable energy costs over time. In addition, many factories utilize cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) systems, which generate electricity and thermal energy simultaneously, to maximize overall energy efficiency. CHP systems come in various sizes and can be powered by natural gas, biomass, or other energy sources. As the manufacturing industries continue to evolve in today's America, there is a growing consciousness for eco-friendly energy solutions, improving energy efficiency, and minimizing carbon emissions. This shift enables the adoption of a mix of power sources incorporating conventional energy resources such as fossil fuels and nuclear power with renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power to maintain a stable supply of power to American factories. So, while the statement \\"These advantages are global.\\" suggests that there may be universally accepted benefits in the context of the question, it does not identify the primary source of power in American factories or provide specific details.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of person was Kat's mom before she got married? ?  In 1988, when Katrina \\"Kat\\" Connors was 17, her beautiful but mercurial mother, Eve, disappeared without a trace. The story weaves back-and-forth with flashbacks of Eve's past life and the present day. In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker. The detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating. Kat dismisses this theory, just like she did three years ago, but after mentioning the topic to her friends Beth and Mickey they tell her they suggested this same theory to her and she dismissed them as well. Kat suspects Phil of having slept with Eve and confronts him the night before she is to return to college, but Phil angrily rebuffs it and tells her that her father knows where her mother is. A:","output":"Before Kat's mother Eve got married, she was depicted as a wild and free-spirited individual. The narrative suggests that Eve was a vivacious and lively character, embodying the spirit of youth and rebelliousness. She was the kind of individual who lived life on her own terms without caring much about social norms or societal structure. This rebellious streak is evident from the fact that she was described as a \\"wild girl\\" during her past life in the flashbacks. This descriptor indicates that she was possibly outgoing, uncontained, and loved adventure, typical characteristics of someone who is considered 'wild'. Moreover, Eve seems to have had a capability to attract attention on her terms, evidenced by the fact that she was described as 'beautiful' and 'mercurial.' Her beauty was a defining trait that she carried even after marriage, using it to maintain her appeal and allure in her ongoing struggle with age. The term 'mercurial' denotes 'quick and changeable in temperament,' which suggests Eve was a person characterized by unpredictability, changeability, and impulsive behavior. This further reinforces the idea of her wild and free-spirited nature. However, with marriage to Brock, a man described as ordinary and leading an 'uneventful' life, her 'wild' personality gradually became domesticated, signaling a shift from her earlier outgoing character to a more home-centered life. Even after this transition, it's worth noting that the 'wild' edge was never truly erased from her character, as she still sought to keep alive her youthful wildness and behaved in a seductive manner when her husband Brock was away. This duality in her nature indicates that Eve was a complex character with a mix of qualities - initially nonconformist and vivacious, who turned into a housewife but still sought fun and adventure, suggesting a struggle to conform to her role fully. Therefore, prior to her marriage, Kat's mother Eve was essentially a beautiful, mercurial, and wild woman."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is up on posthumous heresy charges due to his controversial writings. Apparently, Vatican authorities are trying to modernize and do not want to acknowledge that Satan as an actual evil entity exists.Meanwhile, the teenage Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with her guardian Sharon Spencer in New York while her mother is away on location filming a movie, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Regan claims she remembers nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C., but Tuskin believes her memories are only buried or repressed.

Write an article based on this summary: Fill out pro and con columns on a sheet of paper. Keep emotional distance from the issue you’re evaluating. Consider how the “cons” can be overcome.","output":"Title: A Balanced Approach: Utilizing Pro and Con Lists for Effective Decision-Making Introduction In a world where decisions are the stepping stones towards success, it is essential to approach them with a level head and clear perspective. One classic and effective technique to help individuals and businesses analyze complex issues is the creation of pro and con lists. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to utilize pro and con lists for well-informed decision-making, remaining emotionally detached from the issue, and overcoming potential setbacks. Step 1: Fill out Pro and Con Columns on a Sheet of Paper The first and most basic step in creating a pro and con list is to take a sheet of paper and divide it into two columns. Label one column \\"Pros\\" and the other column \\"Cons.\\" Write down every conceivable advantage and disadvantage you can think of for the issue you're evaluating. It is helpful to consider both short-term and long-term implications. Step 2: Keep Emotional Distance from the Issue As humans, it is natural to have an emotional attachment to the decisions we make. However, emotions can cloud our judgment and lead to choices that may not be the most beneficial in the long run. To effectively utilize pro and con lists, it is essential to distinguish personal feelings or biases from logical reasoning. By focusing on facts and objective criteria, you can make a well-rounded decision that weighs the option's effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Step 3: Consider How the \\"Cons\\" Can Be Overcome One common drawback in using pro and con lists is the tendency to view the \\"Cons\\" column as insurmountable barriers. However, it's important to remember that many of these obstacles can be overcome or mitigated with proper planning and resources. After completing your list, dedicate time to actively brainstorming strategies and solutions to address each drawback. This proactive approach helps paint a clearer picture of the overall feasibility, enabling you to make a more informed decision. Conclusion Employing pro and con lists as a decision-making tool is a simple yet powerful practice that paves the way for intentional and informed choices. The key to unlocking the full potential of pro and con lists lies in maintaining an emotional distance from the issue under consideration while taking a balanced view of the advantages and drawbacks.

In early March, the administration postponed action on proposals for increasing aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.

Over the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year. In 1661 Louis XIV, who was particularly hostile to the Huguenots, started assuming control of his government and began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict. In 1681 he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace. Ask a question about this article.","output":"From the information provided, we can delve into multiple aspects of the relationship between political decisions and religious tensions in the period of Louis XIII and Louis XIV in France. Notably, the course of action they took affected not only the Huguenots but also impacted the politics, economy, and social dynamics of the country. Starting from Louis XIII's reign, the implementation of the Edict of Nantes, which granted certain rights to the Huguenots, varied wildly based on the contemporary political climate. After Louis XIII's death, his son, Louis XIV, started to gain control of France. Known for his hostility towards the Huguenots, Louis XIV began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict, thus weakening the protections it offered to the Protestants. This shift in approach was notably apparent in 1661, marking the start of a gradually intensifying campaign against Protestantism in France. In 1681, Louis XIV furthered his efforts to suppress the Huguenots by implementing the policy of dragonnades. This policy employed the use of military troops, specifically dragoons, to pressure Huguenot families into converting to Roman Catholicism or leaving the country under the threat of violence and harassment. The dragonnades, while not explicitly outlawing Protestantism, made life very uncomfortable for Huguenots, pushing them towards a difficult choice of religious compromise or migration. However, Louis XIV took the final and most significant step against the Huguenots in October 1685, with the issuance of the Edict of Fontainebleau. This edict affected a complete turnaround, revoking the Edict of Nantes and making Protestantism illegal in France. Consequently, this move stripped Huguenots of their previously acknowledged religious and civil rights, pushing religious tolerance in France to a breaking point. The revocation had severe repercussions for France. While it did not lead to renewed religious warfare, it still prompted a wave of migration from France. Many Huguenots chose to leave the country rather than convert to Catholicism. These individuals primarily found refuge in regions like Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic, and Switzerland where Protestantism was more prevalent and accepted. Notwithstanding the exodus, a significant population of Protestants remained in France, specifically in the Cévennes region of the Massif Central. Known as the Camisards, this group of Protestants initiated a resistance against the government in response to Louis XIV's anti-Protestant policies. They launched a revolt in 1702, leading to intermittent skirmishes that didn't conclusively end until 1715. Despite continued oppression, the government substantially reduced their assault on the Camisards post-1715. In conclusion, the religious policies under the reign of Louis XIII and Louis XIV significantly influenced the practice of Protestantism in France. From fluctuating enforcement of the Edict of Nantes, through the intimidation campaigns of dragonnades, to the final revocation of the Edict, their reigns marked a dramatic curbing of religious liberty and the resulting migration and revolt. These events underline the profound impacts of politics on religious freedom and societal dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: A Charlotte, N.C., man was charged with first-degree murder of a 79-year-old woman whom police said he scared to death. In an attempt to evade policemen after a bank robbery, the Associated Press reports that 20-year-old Larry Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell. Police say he didn't touch Parnell but that she died after suffering a heart attack that was caused by terror. Can the guy be held responsible for the woman's death? Prosecutors  said that he can under the state's murder rule, which allows someone to be charged with murder if he or she causes another person's death while committing or fleeing from a severe crime like robbery--even if he or she doesn't kill someone on purpose. But, medically speaking, can someone actually be frightened to death? We asked Martin Samuels, chairman of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Absolutely, no question about it. The body has a natural protective method called the fight-or-flight response , which was originally described by Walter Cannon,the chairman of Harvard University's physiology department from 1906 to 1942. If, in the wild, an animal is faced with a life-threatening situation, the autonomic nervous system responds by increasing heart rate, increasing blood flow to the muscles, and slowing digestion, among other things. All of this increases the chances of succeeding in a fight or running away from an aggressive beast. This process certainly would be of help to primitive humans. However, in the modern world there is obvious decline of the fight-or-flight response. The autonomic nervous system uses the chemical messenger to send signals to various parts of the body to activate the fight-or-flight response. This chemical is toxic in large amounts; it damages the organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. It is believed that almost all sudden deaths are caused by damage to the heart. There is almost no other organ that would fail so fast as to cause sudden death. Kidney failure, liver failure, those things... Question: Why the Charlotte, N.C., man was charged? Options: A: Because he threatened the policemen to kill an old woman. B: Because he caused an old woman's terror and she died.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: How do geese normally get from place to place? Possible A: carried by people, guard house, fly, follow ultralight airplane, group together  Why is \\"fly\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Fly\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects the most natural and predominant form of locomotion exhibited by geese. Geese, like many species of birds, rely primarily on their ability to fly when moving to different locations, whether it be for the purposes of migration, foraging, or simply moving around within their habitat. Flying is not only an essential aspect of geese's biological and anatomical makeup but also plays a critical role in their survival and adaptation to various environments. In contrast, the other possible answers given do not conform to the same level of common sense understanding, and here are the reasons why: 1. Carried by people: Geese are wild animals, and in general, they do not rely on humans for transportation. While it is true that domesticated geese or injured/geese under rehabilitation might occasionally be carried by humans, this is not the norm for geese as a species. Therefore, considering this an expected mode of transportation for geese would not align with human common sense. 2. Guard house: This answer does not pertain to any form of transportation but instead refers to a general concept of geese being used as \\"guard animals\\" due to their territorial and protective nature when they are on the ground. This doesn't explain how they get from place to place, so it does not make sense from a human common sense perspective. 3. Follow ultralight airplane: While there have been instances of researchers using ultralight aircraft to guide migratory birds like geese, this is an artificial and rare event that is not representative of how geese naturally get from one place to another. Though it can be an interesting example, human common sense understands that geese primarily rely on their innate ability to fly rather than following external devices or human-made objects for navigation. 4. Group together: Though geese do form groups, known as flocks or gaggles, when traveling, this answer does not address the actual mode of transportation utilized by geese. Grouping together is a behavior exhibited by geese during their journey, but it's not how they literally move from one place to another, so it does not align with human common sense as a complete answer. In summary, the reason \\"fly\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense is that it is the most accurate, widespread, and natural method of transportation employed by geese. Flying is an intrinsic part of their life cycle and a primary means of getting from place to place that has evolved over time to ensure their survival, adaptation, and continuation as a species. Other suggested answers either inaccurately describe the natural behavior of geese or only provide a partial understanding of their movement strategies, making \\"fly\\" the most reasonable and logical answer from a human common sense standpoint."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: After the hot water passes through the ground coffee, it absorbs the flavors and aroma, transforming into brewed coffee. This brewed coffee then drips down and collects in the coffee pot below.

Read this and answer the question A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period. The Pennsylvania period is separated by the drop in Carboniferous era sea levels from what other period?","output":"Alright, let me make this simple for you. There were two important periods of time long, long ago - the Mississippian Period and the Pennsylvanian Period. They both happened during a big time called the Carboniferous Era. The Pennsylvanian Period started when the sea levels dropped during the Carboniferous Era. So, the Pennsylvania period is separated from the Mississippian Period by this drop in sea levels."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head includes an event or an action in the Tail or not. This happens when the Tail denotes a step within the larger head event.

Here, the Head is \\"exercise\\" and the Tail is \\"work up sweat.\\" The two phrases are given and separated by \\"<sep>\\". Part #2: Recognize the participants and their roles. Usage: PersonX is always the subject of the event. In this case, PersonX is not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume that PersonX is performing both the exercise and working up sweat.  Part #3: Determine if Tail denotes a step within the larger Head event. Usage: \\"Yes\\", working up a sweat is a step within the larger event of exercising. In this example, working up a sweat is a result or part of the exercise, so the Tail denotes a step within the larger Head event. Part #4: Classify the answer as \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\".

Question: who makes good investments? Movie title: Brewster's Millions Movie plot: Monty Brewster is a Minor League Baseball pitcher with the Hackensack Bulls. He and his best friend Spike Nolan, the Bulls' catcher, are arrested after a post-game bar fight and cannot afford bail. A stranger offers bail, if they will come to New York City with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville &amp; Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, whom he has never met, has left him his entire fortune but with several conditions. Brewster is challenged to either take 1 million upfront, or spend 30 million within 30 days to inherit 300 million. If he chooses the former, the law firm becomes the executor of the estate and divides the money among charities (after taking a fee). In the latter case, after 30 days, he may not own any assets that are not already his, and he must get value for the services of anyone he hires. He may donate only 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling, and he may not waste the money by purchasing and destroying valuable items. Finally, he is not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. If he fails to spend the entire 30 million, he forfeits the balance and inherits nothing. Brewster decides to take the 30 million challenge, and Angela Drake, a paralegal from the law firm, is assigned to accompany him and keep track of his spending. Brewster, who has no concept of money (never having earned more than 11,000 a year), rents an expensive hotel suite at the Plaza Hotel, hires personal staff on exorbitant salaries, and places bad bets. However, Spike makes good investments, earning Brewster money. Realizing that he is making no headway, Brewster decides to run for Mayor of New York City and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for \\"None of the Above.\\" The two major candidates threaten to sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, but they settle out of court for several million dollars. Brewster then hires the New York Yankees for a three-inning exhibition against the Bulls, with himself as the pitcher. He is forced to end...
