You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: BY SALENA ZITO szito@tribweb.com      It’s been 40 years since Republicans have gone to their convention without a clear nominee, but when they did, Pennsylvania was right at the heart of the struggle – because of the state’s unusual process of assigning delegates.      Pennsylvania’s primary contest is unlike others.      For years, the Keystone State primary has been a “preferential primary” – simply a beauty contest – and had no connection whatsoever to delegate selection.      It’s not winner-take-all. It’s not winner-take-most. It’s not even proportional.      The vast majority of Pennsylvania’s Republican delegates are technically “unbound” or “uncommitted.”      Used to be they all were, but this year party rules changed slightly, making 14 “at large” delegates bound to vote for the winner of the PA Primary, but on the first ballot only.      There are also three “automatic” delegate slots for the state party chairman (Rob Gleason), the National Committeeman (Bob Asher) and National Committeewoman (Christine Toretti).      The remaining 54 delegates, elected by Republican primary voters in each of Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional districts (three per district) remain legally “uncommitted.”      They are not bound to vote for any particular candidate and are free to exercise their own judgment in selecting a nominee.      They may have their own preferences and loyalties, but they appear on the primary ballot without any indication of what those might be.      That means there is no guarantee – whatsoever – that the majority of Pennsylvania’s delegates will go with the winner of the Pennsylvania primary.      It has happened before.      “Pennsylvania’s huge bloc of uncommitted delegates would be pivotal in a contested convention. Pennsylvania would be in the center of every discussion and at the heart of every action,” said Charlie Gerow, a Harrisburg based media strategist.      Gerow had a front-row seat to the importance of Pennsylvania’s unique delegate set-up as a member of Ronald Reagan’s political team in the last contested GOP convention in 1976.      The 1976 primary race between Reagan and Gerald Ford was so close that Reagan chose Pennsylvania Senator Dick Schweiker as his running mate far in advance of the convention, believing it would help him siphon delegates from Ford.      But the delegates – all legally uncommitted – were effectively controlled by Drew Lewis, who held the delegation for Ford, according to Gerow.      “Four years later, Lewis devised and executed the strategy that won Reagan the majority of the delegates in that year’s Pennsylvania primary even though (Reagan) lost the primary to George H.W. Bush,” Gerow explained.      In 1980, Ronald Reagan lost the primary popular vote to Bush by about 100,000 votes, but he took the lion’s share of delegates because of the state’s unique rules – and thus won the only part of the primary that counts.      In short, Donald Trump could win the popular vote in Pennsylvania but lack the organizational infrastructure to fill a slate of delegates who support his candidacy. To date, Marco Rubio had the most impressive organization for getting supporting delegates on the ballot. The John Kasich campaign had been reaching out to people on the ballot even before Rubio dropped out.      Gerow has attended 10 consecutive conventions – more than any other Pennsylvanian Republican. He has been a delegate three times and is on the ballot again.      “I am currently undecided,” he said, having been an early supporter and national co-chair of Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign.      This story was first posted 1:32 p.m. Thursday, March 17      Comments ||||| HERSHEY, Pa. — Ted Cruz declared definitively on Wednesday that the fight for the Republican presidential nomination is “definitely headed to Cleveland,” where, he said, “the people are going to prevail.”      “Nobody's getting 1237 [delegates] – Donald knows that. We’re headed to a contested convention,” Cruz told NBC News while shaking hands after his rally here in a state with 71 delegates up for grabs in next Tuesday's primary.      “The reason why he has so many of his media surrogates repeating the mantra that the race has got to be over now is because he knows he cannot earn a majority of the delegates in Cleveland,” Cruz continued, calling Trump “a fringe and marginal candidate.\\"      Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed Ted Cruz: We're fighting for the young people 3:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      Cruz exited New York’s primary without winning a single delegate, nearly mathematically vanishing his ability to win the nomination before the convention – a standard he often used last month to indirectly suggest John Kasich and, then, Marco Rubio should leave the race.      Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do.”      Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2016      But Trump – in order for him to win outright and avoid heading to a contested convention -- would still have to win 57 percent of the remaining delegates.      The Cruz campaign is now turning its attention to Pennsylvania, where 54 unbound delegates are in play next Tuesday.      A top Cruz campaign aide, while acknowledging the narrative is unfavorable to Cruz in the northeast, said it’s “highly likely” Cruz will pull at least 30 delegates out of Pennsylvania.      “Donald and the media want to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is a suburb of Manhattan,” said Cruz, adding: “That's their telling -- Manhattan has spoken and Pennsylvania will quietly file into obedience.”      The crowd defiantly jeered before Cruz finished his thought: “You know what, I've got a lot more faith in the people of Pennsylvania.”      Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed Cruz: I've got 'more faith in the people of Pennsylvania' 1:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      While addressing the crowd, Cruz reframed the race and the role of Pennsylvania’s delegates, exclaiming he’ll “take ‘em” next week.      A campaign aide told NBC News it does not anticipate beating Trump in the popular vote in the state, meaning Cruz would lose out on its 17 at-large delegates, which go to the victor. Polls currently show Cruz losing by around 20 percentage points.      But each of the state’s 18 congressional districts will elect three delegates to the national convention. The Cruz campaign is pushing a slate of Cruz-loyalists for 26 of the 54 unbound slots up for the taking. It says others eligible on the ballot to become delegates, particularly longtime state activists able to win on their name alone, have committed to Cruz as well. Cruz has personally met with several of the potential delegates.      At Cruz’s Hershey rally, the campaign passed out a flier telling people to “please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.”      The Cruz campaign passed out a flier telling people to “please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.” Frank Thorp/NBC News      Those delegates will be able to vote for whichever candidate they desire at the national convention in Cleveland, but the Cruz campaign says it recruited these specific individuals this winter to run as delegates after they pledged to vote for Cruz on the convention floor.      The campaign is now looking to target particular congressional districts where it sees itself as having the most viable opportunities to coalesce its supporters around its pre-designated slate of delegates.      “As you look at Erie, central Pennsylvania, look at the districts in southwestern Pennsylvania, you’re going to see a lot of Senator Cruz in those areas over the next few days,” said Lowman Henry, the state chair for Cruz, who compared the politics of the state to Wisconsin, where Cruz won big two weeks ago.      Patti McCorkle, a mother who attended Cruz’s rally at Hershey’s antique car museum, defended the state’s delegate system, adding she hoped “it’ll work out in this day and age to give us a Ted Cruz presidency.”      And citing the Constitution, she noted: “Ted Cruz is for strong states’ rights – as per the Constitution – and the states get to choose how their delegates are going to be chosen and how they’re going to use those delegates.” ||||| Pennsylvania, which holds its primary next Tuesday, uses a nonbinding “loophole” primary — and that could cost Donald Trump the Republican nomination.      If the state adopted the delegate rules of any other primary, he would probably be an even-money favorite, or better, to amass the 1,237 delegates needed before the convention.      Instead, his chances may come down to the whims of 54 unpledged Pennsylvania delegates.      No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound — allowed to vote for whomever they please at the convention. That’s because it conducts its loophole primary in two parts. First is the “beauty contest,” which is a presidential primary preference vote. The winner of the beauty contest gets all of Pennsylvania’s 17 at-large and bonus delegates.      But the remaining 54 — the three delegates awarded to each congressional district — are unbound and elected in the delegate selection primary. In this part, voters directly elect delegates to the national convention. What makes Pennsylvania’s G.O.P. delegate selection primary so distinctive is that the ballot includes no guidance on whom a delegate will support at the national convention (the prospective Democratic delegates commit to a candidate). A voter will just see a list of names — some of whom might be recognizable, but others might as well be Joe Schmo. |||||Summary:","output":"Pennsylvania's primary contest is unlike other states, as the majority of its Republican delegates are technically unbound or uncommitted which means that they are not tied to voting for any particular candidate and can exercise their own judgment in selecting a nominee. This makes Pennsylvania significant in a contested convention and is important to the current GOP race. In this context, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has declared that the fight for Republican presidential nomination is definitely headed for a contested convention in Cleveland. Pennsylvania holds its primary next Tuesday and Cruz has turned his attention to the state, telling a rally that Donald Trump and the media want to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is a suburb of Manhattan, which he does not believe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence states that a grapefruit can roll a greater distance across an orchard compared to one rolling across a cannery. Step 2: Understand the question. The question is asking which surface (orchard or cannery) will cause the grapefruit to get hotter. Step 3: Make assumptions if necessary. Since we are given no information on the temperature difference between the orchard and the cannery, nor how they might affect the grapefruit, we must make an assumption to solve the problem. Let's assume that the temperature of the grapefruit depends on the rolling distance and the difference between the two surfaces doesn't affect the temperature directly. Step 4: Apply the assumption to the given sentence. Following our assumption, a grapefruit rolling a greater distance in the orchard will generate more heat due to friction between the grapefruit and the ground. Step 5: Compare options A and B. Option A (orchard) aligns with our assumption that the longer rolling distance results in the grapefruit getting hotter. Option B (cannery) suggests the opposite. Step 6: Identify the incorrect answer based on our assumption. The incorrect answer is option B (cannery), so we will return the string \\"cannery\\" as our solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

В настоящее время экономика многих стран Европы имеет сравнительно хорошую динамику, и это обусловлено рядом особенностей и факторов. Прежде всего, стоит отметить стабильность политических и экономических систем на континенте. Большинство государств Европы функционирует на основе свободного рынка и демократии, что создает устойчивые условия для экономического роста. Благодаря развитой инфраструктуре, привлекательным для инвестиций ставкам налогообложения и высокой квалификации рабочей силы, страны Европы способны привлекать инвестиции из разных частей мира. Инвестиции, в свою очередь, создают рабочие места и способствуют увеличению экономической активности. Европейский союз, как крупнейший интеграционный блок, сыграл значимую роль в поддержании благоприятных экономических условий на континенте. Введение единой валюты – евро – сделало более прозрачным валютный обмен и улучшило экономическую интеграцию между странами-участницами. Кроме того, ЕС использует систему единого рынка, которая позволяет товарам, услугам, капиталу и рабочей силе двигаться свободно между странами-членами, содействуя тем самым экономическому росту. Несмотря на несколько глобальных экономических кризисов, в том числе и последний, вызванный пандемией COVID-19, страны Европы продемонстрировали умение справляться с неблагоприятными ситуациями.

Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeb Bush. He was talking to some people on a show called Fox News. Jeb is the brother of a former leader of the country, so people listen to what he has to say. One day, a lady named Megyn Kelly asked Jeb if he would have made the same choice as his brother to go to a big event that happened in the past. Jeb said yes, he would have, and so would many other people at that time.  But then some people, even those who liked him, said they did not agree with him. One person, named Chris Christie, said if he knew back then what he knows now, he would not have made that choice. This made Jeb think about what he said. Later, Jeb talked to a man named Sean Hannity, and told him that maybe he did not understand the question right the first time. He thought the question was about what people knew back then, not what they know now. So he didn't really know what he would do if he had today's knowledge. Jeb agreed that some mistakes were made in the past, and it was important to learn from them. As time went on, people kept talking and learning more about how to make good decisions for their country. They also talked about how to save and spend money for big events called elections. And everyone hoped that they could work together to make the best choices for everyone."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In the given example, two distinct sentences are provided, one labeled sentence_A and the other labeled sentence_B. This part of the definition asks you to understand that the task involves comparing the content and meaning of these two sentences. Part 2: Determine the relationship between the sentences (entailment, neutral, contradiction) Usage: Analyzing sentence_A and sentence_B and figuring out whether they entail, contradict, or neither (neutral). In this example, both sentences describe a man and two women in a room with candles and a table. However, there are differences in lighting and positions (standing vs. sitting). Since the sentences do not clearly agree or disagree with each other, the relation is deemed neutral. Part 3: Encode the relationship as a numeric value (0, 1, or 2) Usage: Assigning the value 1 to represent a neutral relationship between sentence_A and sentence_B. Based on the analysis in Part 2, we determined the relationship between the two sentences is neutral. The instructions associate the number 1 with a neutral relationship.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Pick a wall that allows the whole room to see the TV and will provide the best picture quality and won’t be affected by sunlight coming in from windows. You also need to consider the position of the furniture in the room and what direction they face.  Because you need to screw holes into the wall to mount your LCD TV, be sure of your placement before you begin mounting it! In a living room, the center of the wall across from the main entranceway allows for a wider viewing angle. Place your TV on the wall where it’s most likely to be at eye level when you’re viewing it. If you plan to mostly watch it while sitting on the sofa you’ll want to place it lower than you would if you plan to mostly watch it while standing or at a bar. Use a ruler or tape measure to measure from the floor to the best height to put the TV at eye level and lightly mark the height with a pencil.  Placing your TV with the center at 42 inches (110 cm) off the ground will put the screen at eye level with the average adult sitting down. If you plan to view the TV more often while standing, then mount it with the center of the TV 53 inches (130 cm) from the ground. Mount the TV as close to eye level as possible if there’s an obstruction such as an existing appliance or piece of furniture. The cables and wires of your TV and any devices you plan to connect to it can be unsightly. When you’re picking a place to mount your TV, think about how difficult it will be for you to conceal them to help inform your decision.  Centering the TV on a bare wall in the center of the room may make it difficult for you to hide the wires. Use furniture placement to help conceal the wires. You need to have a clear area to work in when you’re mounting your LCD TV. Slide over any chairs, tables, or sofas so you can access the wall easily. Take down any paintings, pictures, or decor so they’re out of your way.  Gently place the items that were hanging on the wall nearby so you don’t crack or break them. Take down anything hanging on the wall so they can’t wobble, shake, or potentially fall when you’re drilling into the wall.

However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

They both could laugh together, appreciating the humor in the cat's name.    2. If Aubrey picked the cat's name seriously, they might feel hurt or offended by Riley's laughter. In this case, Aubrey could interpret the laughter as a sign of disrespect or insensitivity towards their choice. They may become defensive or even question their decision about the chosen name.    3. If Aubrey is open-minded, they might not be too affected by Riley's laughter and consider it as just a difference of opinions. They could either agree to disagree on the name selection, or perhaps even reconsider the chosen name based on Riley's input.    4.

Sentence 1: A bunch of people twirled past me, dancing. Sentence 2: People were doing the salsa. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the truth of the second sentence, we need to consider the relationship between the two sentences and the context in which they are presented. Both sentences describe people's actions in a context of dancing. However, they do not specifically mention the same group of people or the same moment in time. In sentence 1, people are described as twirling past the speaker, which suggests a type of dance that includes spinning or rotational movements. Twirling is a general term that can apply to various forms of dance, including but not limited to salsa dancing. This sentence does not specify the style of dance that people are engaging in, but it provides information about the nature of the movement (twirling). In sentence 2, the action becomes more specific - people are stated to be doing the salsa. Salsa, as a distinct style of dance, has identifiable and characteristic movements that include twirling, among other elements. However, it is important to note that the second sentence does not specify that the people doing the salsa are the same as the ones mentioned in the first sentence or that these two instances are happening at the same time. Given this information, we can determine that if sentence 1 is true, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that sentence 2 is also true. The truth of the second sentence depends on whether or not the twirling people in the first sentence are indeed engaging in salsa dancing. In conclusion, while there is some overlap in the actions described in the two sentences, the truth of the first sentence does not automatically guarantee the truth of the second sentence. More information and context would be required to deduce whether the second sentence is true."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions? ?  In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell is George W. De Long."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South.

Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Answer:","output":"Randy Jackson, an accomplished musician, songwriter, and producer, is best known for his role as a judge on the hit television series \\"American Idol.\\" However, in the early 1980s, he was also a member of the iconic rock band Journey. In Journey, Randy Jackson played bass guitar and contributed backing vocals during his brief tenure with the band. Jackson was a member of Journey for a short period between 1985 and 1987. He was brought in to replace founding member and bassist Ross Valory after some internal conflicts within the band. During this time, Journey underwent a slight lineup change, as the band was transitioning from its height of success in the early 1980s to a period of uncertainty. As the band's bassist, Jackson played on their ninth studio album \\"Raised on Radio,\\" which was released in May 1986. The album, produced by lead vocalist Steve Perry, features some of Jackson's best work as a bassist. With his signature groove, he added depth to songs such as \\"Be Good to Yourself,\\" \\"I'll Be Alright Without You,\\" and \\"Girl Can't Help It.\\" Despite some negative reviews regarding the album's commercial sound, \\"Raised on Radio\\" achieved platinum status and peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200 chart. Simultaneously, Jackson contributed to Journey's live performances during this era. The band embarked on a North American tour called the \\"Raised on Radio Tour\\" between 1986 and 1987 to support the album. Thanks to his remarkable musical skills, Jackson quickly became an essential part of the live shows, even though his tenure with the band was short-lived. Unfortunately, Journey disbanded temporarily in 1987 due to personal issues and a need for a break. Consequently, this marked the end of Randy Jackson's time with the band. When they regrouped in 1991, Ross Valory returned to his role as Journey's bassist. In summary, Randy Jackson played bass guitar and provided backing vocals in Journey during a pivotal time in their history. He performed on the \\"Raised on Radio\\" album and participated in the subsequent tour. Although his time in Journey was brief, his talent and contributions to the band should not be overlooked. Today, Randy Jackson is fondly remembered for his work with the band, along with his long and successful career in the music industry."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The Grizzly Bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him. The other two arrive and rescue Wes, but are unable to help Ritch. The Bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep. The vehicle starts again and they leave, but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff.

In 1958, some workers, who were building a road through the jungles of Northern California, often found huge footprints in the earth around their camp. Then in 1967, Roger Patterson, a man who was interested in finding Bigfoot, went into the same jungles with a friend. While riding, they were suddenly thrown off from their horses. Patterson saw a tall apelike animal standing not far away. He managed to take photos of the hairy creature before it disappeared in the jungles.

Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Berman and Company is a Washington , D.C. based public affairs and non-profit management firm founded by lawyer and former lobbyist Rick Berman . In addition to its public relations clients , Berman and Company runs several industry - funded non-profit organizations such as the Center for Consumer Freedom , the Center for Union Facts , and the Employment Policies Institute . The non-profits have worked on issues including obesity , health care , food safety , labor law , alcohol , and government regulation . The firm is known for campaigns that include aggressive advertising , opposition research , and online communications .  - The Employment Policies Institute is a fiscally conservative non-profit American think tank that conducts research on employment issues such as minimum wage and health care. It was established in 1991 and has been described as \\"a nonprofit research group that studies issues of entry-level employment.\\"  - Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.  - Public interest, according to the \\"Random House Dictionary\\", is \\"1. the welfare or well-being of the general public; commonwealth. 2. appeal or relevance to the general populace: a news story of public interest.\\"  - A think tank, policy institute, or research institute is an organization that performs research and advocacy concerning topics such as social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture. Most policy institutes are non-profit organizations, which some countries such as the United States and Canada provide with tax exempt status. Other think tanks are funded by governments, advocacy groups, or businesses, or derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects.  - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - The Center for Union Facts (CUF) is an American interest group that is critical of labor unions. It is one of several advocacy and public relations groups founded by Richard Berman, whose Washington, D.C.-based public affairs firm, Berman and Company, specializes in research, communications and advertising.  - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'berman and company' with the relationship of 'founder'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jesse Donald Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (nee Moore). His parents were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors immigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph. In 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own sitcom, The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy--and originally cousin--of Sheriff Andy Taylor (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy, three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.  A summary of the show from the website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Deputy Barney Fife:  Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.  When the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his straight man, similar to their roles in No Time for Sergeants. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \\"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\\"  Knotts believed remarks by Griffith that The Andy Griffith Show would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with Universal Studios. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \\"big time,\\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force. When did the show run for","output":"The Andy Griffith Show ran for eight seasons, from October 3, 1960, to April 1, 1968. Don Knotts, who portrayed Barney Fife, left the show in 1965 after the fifth season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the following context:  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Given the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\", is \\"make a chicken\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"make a chicken\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" after spending all day cooking a pot roast. Firstly, when considering the context provided, it is clear that Kendall has devoted significant time and effort into preparing the pot roast. The phrase \\"all day\\" suggests that the process has been lengthy, and the information that the roast is \\"finally\\" done implies a sense of completion and satisfaction. Therefore, it is unlikely that Kendall would immediately want to undertake another potentially time-consuming cooking task, considering that one has already been completed. Furthermore, pot roast is generally considered a main dish that is wholesome and filling on its own. It is more plausible that Kendall would be interested in preparing accompaniments to the pot roast, such as side dishes, a salad, or a sauce that complements the dish. Alternatively, Kendall might want to set the table, serve the pot roast, and perhaps enjoy eating the meal with family or friends. Additionally, it is important to consider the logical sequence of events. It is more reasonable to assume that, after spending all day cooking a dish, Kendall would likely want to focus on the next steps that involve sharing and enjoying the meal, rather than immediately starting another cooking project. This could include cleaning up, storing leftovers, or discussing the pot roast with others. Finally, even if Kendall were interested in making a chicken dish in the near future, it would most likely be planned for a separate mealtime (such as the following day) rather than immediately after finishing the pot roast. Cooking and preparing multiple dishes simultaneously is usually done for special occasions, large gatherings, or when catering for a group with diverse dietary preferences. In this context, there is no indication that any of these scenarios apply. Taking all of these factors into account, \\"make a chicken\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" after spending all day cooking a pot roast. Instead, a more appropriate answer might involve serving the pot roast, enjoying the meal, or preparing complementary dishes to enhance the dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Subject: The boy Bill, who I watched (referring to Bill) Verb: was 2. Check for agreement between the subject(s) and verb(s). The subject \\"The boy Bill, who I watched\\" agrees with the verb \\"was\\" since it is a singular subject. 3.

Former NFL player Darren Sharper was in Los Angeles police custody Thursday night, having turned himself in after New Orleans police issued an arrest warrant alleging he raped two women in that city last year.      Sharper had already been charged with raping and drugging two women in Los Angeles and was free on bail.      The former New Orleans Saints player surrendered at his attorney's office to LAPD detectives. Police said he is being detained on the fugitive warrant from New Orleans.      In addition to Sharper, detectives and investigators with the Orleans Parish district attorney's office obtained an arrest warrant for 26-year-old Eric Nunez, described as an acquaintance of the former football player.      Sharper is now accused of raping at least eight women and committing sexual battery against a woman in Miami.      New Orleans police had previously said they were investigating at least one rape allegation against Sharper.      Authorities revealed that detectives had learned that two woman were allegedly assaulted by Sharper, both on the night of Sept. 23.      \\"New information uncovered also indicates that Nunez allegedly raped both women at the same location,\\" said Remi Braden, a department spokeswoman.      In issuing a statement Thursday, the department noted that the crime of aggravated rape carried a potential life sentence of hard labor.      Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Sharper with two counts of rape and five other drug charges in connection with two incidents in October and January. He is also being investigated in Las Vegas and Tempe, Ariz.      Sharper, 38, who has pleaded not guilty to the other charges, was ordered to surrender his passport, stay in Los Angeles and avoid all women. He was free on 1-million bail.

Police provided no other details.      In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said.      According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place.      Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week.      One of Sharper's lawyers disputed all the rape allegations last week at his hearing.      \\"It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company,\\" Leonard Levine said.      Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. ||||| Former NFL safety Darren Sharper, right, huddles with attorney Blair Berk in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Feb. 20. Sharper has pleaded not guilty to charges that he drugged and raped two women he met at a West Hollywood nightclub. (Bob Chamberlin / AP / )      New Orleans police have obtained an arrest warrant for former NFL football player Darren Sharper, who is already charged with drugging and sexually assaulting two women in Los Angeles and raping two others in New Orleans.      In addition to Sharper, detectives and investigators with the Orleans Parish district attorney's office obtained an arrest warrant for 26-year-old Eric Nunez, described as an acquaintance of the former football player.      Sharper is now accused of raping at least eight woman and committing a sexual battery against a woman in Miami.      New Orleans police had previously said they were investigating at least one rape allegation against Sharper.      Authorities revealed that detectives had learned that two woman were allegedly assaulted by Sharper, both on the night of Sept. 23.      \\"New information uncovered also indicates that Nunez allegedly raped both women at the same location,\\" said Remi Braden, a department spokeswoman.      In issuing a statement Thursday, the department noted that the crime of aggravated rape carried a potential life sentence of hard labor.      Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Sharper with two counts of rape and five other drug charges in connection with two incidents in October and January. He is being investigated in Las Vegas; Tempe, Ariz.; and another in New Orleans.      Sharper, 38, who has pleaded not guilty, was ordered to surrender his passport, stay in Los Angeles and avoid all women. He is free on 1-million bail.      “We look forward to the true facts being revealed in this case and we are hopeful that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated before this case is concluded,” Blair Berk, one of Sharper's attorneys, has said.      Court documents allege a disturbing pattern in the incidents, which occurred between Sept. 22 and Jan. 15.      Victims reported meeting the five-time Pro Bowl player -- usually at a nightclub -- then going back to his hotel room or home.      Sharper allegedly offered the women shots to drink, after which they reported immediately blacking out. Many of the women woke up with little or no memory of what happened after the drinks, but felt as though they had been sexually assaulted, authorities said.

They're especially common in athletes, because they often result from overuse and repetitive stresses, such as those that long-distance runners endure.  Sudden increases in activity can also cause stress fractures. For example, if you're usually fairly sedentary but take a hiking holiday, you might end up with a stress fracture. Osteoporosis and certain other conditions that affect bone strength and density make you more prone to stress fractures. Trying to do too much too soon can cause stress fractures. For example, if you're new to exercise and start trying to run a 10k every week, you could end up with a stress fracture. If you feel pain in your foot or ankle that eases when you rest, you may have a stress fracture. If the pain gets worse during normal everyday activities, it's a good sign you have a stress fracture. The pain will also get worse over time.  The pain may feel deep inside your foot, toe, or ankle. Pain isn't just weakness leaving your body. If you experience consistent foot pain, especially if it's even during everyday activities or persists when you rest, see your doctor. Ignoring it could lead to worse injury. If you have a stress fracture, you may notice that the top of your foot is swollen and tender to the touch. Swelling may also occur on the outside of the ankle. Sharp pain when you touch an area of your foot or ankle isn't normal. If you experience pain or tenderness when you touch your foot, see your doctor. Bruises don't always occur with stress fractures, but they can. You may be tempted to \\"tough it out\\" with the pain from a stress fracture, but don't. If you do not seek treatment for a stress fracture, it can get worse over time. The bone may even break completely. Summary:","output":"Stress fractures are common foot and ankle injuries that can happen to people who do too much activity too quickly, especially athletes and those with weak bones, and it's important to see a doctor if you have pain or swelling so it doesn't get worse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87.

Q:Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  Which lake had fewer dissolved nutrients? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, High Lake had fewer dissolved nutrients due to the presence of stratified water layers which limited the mixing of nutrients from the benthos to the photic zone. As a result, this led to lower primary production and lower net productivity in High Lake compared to Low Lake which had no such problems and was an abundant and prolific fishing spot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua? Answer:","output":"The ecosystem functions would likely be less stable in England than in Nicaragua. This is primarily due to the significant differences in biodiversity between the two countries.  Biodiversity plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and resilience of ecosystems. A higher level of biodiversity ensures that a wide range of species is present, interacting with each other and the surrounding environment in complex ways that keep the ecosystem balanced and functional. This allows ecosystems to better withstand disturbances, such as natural disasters, climate change, or human activities, and recover more quickly from such events. As mentioned in the paragraph, Nicaragua is known for its rich biodiversity, with numerous species of birds, plants, and other organisms inhabiting its various ecosystems. In contrast, England has suffered from the effects of intensive farming, industrialization, and urbanization, which have significantly reduced its biodiversity. As a result, England's ecosystems are likely to be less stable and resilient compared to those in Nicaragua.  In a less diverse and stable ecosystem, such as England's, the loss or decline of even a single species can have a more detrimental impact on the overall functionality and balance of the ecosystem. On the other hand, a highly biodiverse ecosystem like Nicaragua's may be more robust in the face of stressors because the numerous species present can fill in gaps and maintain ecological processes even if some species are lost or their populations decline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[4]. Summer.","output":"In July, Australians experience winter. Therefore, the correct answer is option [3]. Winter. The seasons in Australia, just like any other location on Earth, are determined by the Earth's position relative to the sun. There are significant changes in both temperature and the environment during the various seasons. The southern hemisphere, where Australia is located, experiences opposite seasons compared to the northern hemisphere. During the winter season in Australia, which occurs between June and August, the country experiences cooler temperatures as the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. These cooler temperatures mean that the environment changes considerably during this season. In the coastal areas, there is more rain, whereas the snow falls on the higher altitude regions and mountain ranges. In addition to the temperature difference, there are also changes in the natural environment during the winter months. Animals and plants are affected by the cooler conditions. Some animals may go into hibernation to conserve energy, while others, like migratory birds, may move to warmer climates. Additionally, many plant species become dormant or slow down their growth during this time. Australia is a large and diverse country, and the winter season's impact on the environment varies between different regions. For example, the northern part of the country has tropical climate areas and experiences a dry season during this time, which means there is less rainfall and the environment is generally drier compared to the southern regions. In the southern parts of Australia, especially in Tasmania and Victoria, winter can be wet, cold, and sometimes snowy. In conclusion, during the month of July, Australians experience the winter season, which brings about various changes in the environment, such as cooler temperatures, increased precipitation in some areas, and adaptations in both plant and animal life to cope with the seasonal changes. While the specifics vary depending on the region in Australia, the overall environmental impact of winter can be observed throughout the country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James has been HIV positive for 20 years. HIV, by itself, is not a direct cause of death but can lead to AIDS, which is a life-threatening condition. With proper medical treatment, an HIV-positive individual can delay the progression to AIDS indefinitely and live a relatively normal life. With advancements in modern medicine, individuals with HIV can now expect to reach an average human lifespan, assuming they receive and adhere to the appropriate care. Bill, on the other hand, is not HIV positive. However, being 54 years old and homeless can expose him to numerous health risks, although he does not have a specific disease like HIV. In summary, neither individual can be definitively said to be free from diseases or health issues that can lead to death. While James has a manageable chronic condition (HIV), Bill faces the potential for a range of health problems due to his age and living situation. It is essential to recognize the complexity of their health status and refrain from oversimplifying their situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film starts with a brief pre-title clip from presenter Greg Palast s aborted interview with Florida Director of Elections Clayton Roberts , who walks out . Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech . However Palast alleges that Bush used his father s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard Which he subsequently failed to serve . Palast picks up the story with Bush s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the fake felons list compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US 4 million . Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush s election campaign , such as Enron CEO Ken Lay , who as members of Bush s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends , and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments , no-bid contracts , executive orders and deregulation . Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle , where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money , dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family s entry into the oil business , citing the example of Bush s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr s presidency .

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the film 's appeal","output":"In order to determine the sentiment of this sentence – \\"the film 's appeal\\" – it is important to have a larger context as it lacks definitive clues about whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The statement does not convey any specific emotion or opinion towards the film's appeal without additional information surrounding it.  However, I can provide a more insightful analysis of possible interpretations in different contexts: 1. If this phrase is part of a longer sentence or statement that describes the film's appeal in a positive manner, then the sentiment can be considered positive. For example, \\"The film's appeal lies in its fantastic storyline and brilliant acting performances from the whole cast.\\" In this case, the sentiment is positive as it highlights the appealing aspects of the film. 2. Alternatively, if the sentence or statement has a negative connotation, the sentiment would be considered negative. For example, \\"Despite the film's appeal, it failed to deliver on its promise due to a weak script and lackluster direction.\\" In this case, the sentiment is negative, as the mentioned appeal doesn't outweigh the shortcomings of the film. 3. The phrasing could also be used in a neutral context, with neither positive nor negative sentiment. For example, \\"The film's appeal varies depending on the viewer's personal taste and interests.\\" In this instance, the sentiment would be neutral because it presents the appeal as subjective and dependent on individual preferences. In summary, without further context, it's not possible to definitively determine the sentiment of the phrase \\"the film's appeal\\" as either positive or negative. It requires additional information to understand the speaker's emotions or opinions towards the subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She wanted to go to Beijing to watch the 2008 Olympics. Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult. In the past Tibet had no railroad  . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money. However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau  . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours! About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth  . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses   for animals like Tibetan antelopes   to go through. \\"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  . As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school. The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet. With the new railroad, shopping can be more convenient   and faster. Question: Which of the following about the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is TRUE? Options: A: It is not the highest railroad in the world.

That you can order them online is great\\"","output":"Title: Face it: Girl Scout cookies aren't good. That you can order them online is great Introduction There are no two ways about it: Girl Scout cookies have a special place in the hearts and homes of millions of Americans. Purchasing these cookies is often seen as a way to support charitable causes and give girls the opportunity to grow and develop essential life skills. However, as much as we may hate to admit it, Girl Scout cookies simply aren't as delicious or appealing as many other treats on the market. The idea to allow customers to order and purchase these cookies online is a blessing, and in this article, we'll explore why this is the case. A Nostalgic Disappointment The appreciation for Girl Scout cookies often stems from nostalgia, a throwback to a time when life was simpler, and friendships were forged through the sale of these not-so-gourmet treats. These cookies, however, fail to stand the test of time and live up to their hype in terms of quality and taste. In reality, many of these sugar-laden products fall short in comparison to other store-bought baked goods or homemade desserts. Their often dry, crumbly, and overly sweet nature makes it ever-more apparent that a customer's purchase decision is based largely on supporting a cause rather than pure enjoyment. Unhealthy Ingredients It's a well-known fact that Girl Scout cookies are not the healthiest of snacks, often loaded with high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, and calories. Although the Girl Scouts of the USA have made efforts to update their recipes and use better quality ingredients, many of these cookies still contain controversial ingredients like palm oil and high-fructose corn syrup. These concerns about nutrition and sustainability have given customers pause when considering their cookie purchase. Considering today's health-conscious society and increased awareness of sustainable and ethical food choices, there's no doubt that modern consumers are seeking better options in terms of snacks and treats. Savoring the Online Experience In contrast to the quality of the cookies themselves, the introduction of online sales for Girl Scout cookies seems to be hitting the right notes. Although traditional door-to-door or booth sales are nostalgic and a part of the Girl Scout experience, allowing customers to order these cookies online provides convenience and accessibility to those who may not have a scout in their area. The online platform introduces opportunities to widen the customer base and increase Girl Scout cookie sales, even if the primary goal is to support a worthy cause. Online ordering also allows people to choose from a wider range of cookie flavors, taking away the limitations imposed by in-person sales, where scouts may run out of certain types of cookies quickly. This way, customers can simultaneously support their local scout troops and indulge in their \\"guilty pleasure\\" of choice. Supporting the Cause Although the notion that Girl Scout cookies aren't good in terms of taste or nutrition may be disappointing, we cannot forget the ultimate goal behind these sales: supporting the Girl Scouts of the USA and their mission to empower young girls. By purchasing these cookies, customers help fund activities, programs, and experiences that develop leadership skills and build confidence in young women. Conclusion While the quality and nutritional value of Girl Scout cookies may be lacking when compared to other tasty treats on the market, their continued popularity and ability to evoke nostalgic memories keep the sales going. In the end, utilizing an online sales platform to sell Girl Scout cookies is an undeniably smart move. Even if our taste buds no longer crave these cookies, we can still easily support the cause and help create a brighter future for young girls."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The author Meir Shalev was brought to this spot as a boy to look across at the Western Wall - which at the time could not be accessed by Israelis. He would gaze at the top few bricks of this holy Jewish site while his father told him: \\"You will grow up, you will become a soldier and you will fight over this city.\\" At the time Jerusalem was divided between Israeli and Jordanian control. It followed the 1949 armistice that divided the new Jewish state of Israel from other parts of what had been British Mandate Palestine. For Meir Shalev's father, a well-known Israeli poet, the exclusion of Jews from their holiest sites represented a tragedy for his people. The outbreak of war on 5 June 1967 would change many lives - and reshape that part of the Middle East. Israel launched a pre-emptive attack on Egypt and battled Jordanian and Syrian forces the same day. Mr Shalev was about to turn 19 - the age of his country at the time - and remembers a national mood of panic before the conflict. \\"People were talking about the possibility of Israel being destroyed and us being exiled or killed,\\" he says. \\"We were very eager to fight,\\" he remembers. \\"We thought: 'This is our chance'.\\" Mr Shalev found himself in action against Syrian troops on the Golan heights during a series of battles that would lead to Israel's capture of that territory. But it was the occupation of the West Bank that he believes consumed Israel's energy - something he says it has had to \\"deal with\\" ever since its victory in 1967. He recalls how after the war he told his father in a heated confrontation: \\"We took a bite we will suffocate on.\\" Other Israelis saw a divine purpose in the fighting to bring a return to their biblical Jewish lands. In Jerusalem, the conflict saw Israeli troops involved in close quarters fighting with Jordanians. Another young soldier, Yoel Ben Nun, was being transported to a checkpoint that separated control of the city. He speaks of surrounding the Old City at night, facing a battalion of the Jordanian Legion which rapidly retreated. \\"That was a miracle,\\" he says, recalling Israel's victory in six days. Yoel Ben Nun told his commander at the time that he felt like two millennia of history had passed. \\"The meaning was that for 2,000 years the people of Israel were in exile - persecuted, tortured, subjected to anti-Semitism. Those 2,000 years were over,\\" he says. \\"This is what I felt on the Temple Mount at the time,\\" referring to the revered hilltop also known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. Yoel Ben Nun later became a rabbi and joined the movement building Jewish settlements in the West Bank - the territory that Palestinians want for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. For Palestinians, the war represented the loss of land following what they saw as the catastrophe of the first Israeli-Arab conflict two decades earlier. Fatima Khadir was eight years old in 1967 when her family - whom she says were already displaced from their village in the previous war - fled Jerusalem's Old City. She points to the side of her left eye, explaining she was injured by shrapnel from the debris of Israeli bombing. \\"I was looking around me, everyone was grabbing whatever they could - mothers and fathers carrying their babies and children\\". She ended up with her parents in a refugee camp in the desert border area of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Fifty years on, from her home in East Jerusalem, she speaks of her desire to return to her family's village of the 1940s. \\"I still feel the hurt, pain and intolerable struggle,\\" she says. \\"We were never able to go back. I'm still hurting. We are still suffering.\\" The outbreak of war had been accompanied by enthusiastic, but false, radio reports of Arab success in the fighting. Mahmoud Erdisat was training to be a fighter pilot - and would later become a major general in the Jordanian air force. \\"We were very excited that finally we would get the chance to fight the Israelis and get Palestine back,\\" he recalls. But he says it soon became apparent that Israel was overwhelming its opponents. The Israeli territorial increase, claims Mr Erdisat, made it harder to negotiate a \\"just solution\\" on the issue of Palestinian statehood. He believes the Arab defeat also had a profound impact on the way Israel's neighbours came to view themselves. \\"It was a blow to Arab nationalism,\\" he says. But its legacy further fuelled Palestinian national aspirations. Occupation became central to their calls to activism and militancy, placing it firmly on the international agenda for years to come. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This story is about Meir Shalev, a Jewish boy in Israel, who was told by his father that one day he would fight for their city, Jerusalem, that at that time was split between Israeli and Jordanian control. In 1967, when the war broke out, Meir was 19 and eager to fight, thinking it was his chance to change things. During the war, Israel gained more territory but he believed this made things more complicated for them. Meir describes his disagreement with his father, saying that Israel might choke on the bite it took by becoming an occupier of other lands.  Another soldier, Yoel Ben Nun, felt that the war was a miracle, ending 2000 years of Jewish suffering. He eventually became a rabbi and helped set up Jewish settlements in West Bank, although these settlements are considered illegal by international law. Meanwhile, for Fatima Khadir, a Palestinian girl, the war meant losing her home and becoming a refugee. She wished to go back to her old land. The war also made it harder for the Palestinians to negotiate their statehood.  So, in short, the war of 1967 had big effects on Israel, the Palestinians, and this area of the world.

Wang Leehom (born May 17, 1976), sometimes credited as Leehom Wang, is a Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor and film director. Formally trained at the Eastman School of Music, Williams College and Berklee College of Music, his musical style is known for fusing Chinese elements (such as Beijing opera, traditional styles of ethnic minorities, Chinese classical orchestra) with hip-hop and R&B. Wang debuted in 1995 and since then has released over 25 albums, with sales of over 50 million copies. He is also a four-time winner and 19-time nominee of Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards, the \\"Grammys\\" of Chinese music. Born in Rochester, New York, Wang is the second of three sons of immigrants from Taiwan of waishengren heritage. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, moved to the United States to further their college studies in the early 1960s. Influenced by his older brother, Leo Wang, who had been taking violin lessons since he was seven, Wang began to develop a curious interest towards the violin and its musical counterparts when he was three. He begged his mother to put him in violin lessons with his brother but his mother was against it, reasoning that he was too young. When Wang turned six, his mother enrolled him in violin classes, performing along with his brother. As he became a teenager, he began taking piano lessons, also teaching himself the guitar. He also worked several jobs to earn money to buy a second hand drum kit.  He attended Jefferson Road Elementary School, Pittsford Middle School, and Pittsford Sutherland High School in Pittsford, New York. He graduated from Pittsford Sutherland. Passionate for a career in music, he chose to attend Williams College double majoring in music and Asian studies. He joined an all-male a cappella group, The Springstreeters, and the group recorded several demo tracks.  In the summer of 1995, while Wang was visiting his grandparents in Taiwan, he was offered a professional recording contract by Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) after he participated in a talent competition hosted by the label. Not wanting to lose the opportunity, he immediately began preparing for his debut, and released his debut album Love Rival, Beethoven (Qing Di Bei Duo Fen ) that December. The record received little limelight, forcing him to leave the label. He signed with Decca Records the following year, a label then famous for producing \\"powerful singers\\" (Shi Li Pai Ge Shou ) in Taiwan. Wanting to also have control in the idol market, the label initially planned to market Wang as the mainstream \\"romantic idol\\", like with their previous artist Mavis Fan. However, after discovering Wang's talent in music-making, Decca began promoting him as Taiwan's \\"quality idol\\" (You Zhi Ou Xiang ) instead. Wang released his second album If You Heard My Song in 1996, which included some of his own compositions. He co-wrote the album's eponymous title song, which earned positive responses from the audience. The album drew moderately successful sales, and he became a rising star in the idol market, also finding similar successes with his third and fourth albums. During this time, Wang was asked to leave his college studies to pursue a full-time singing career, but he insisted on finishing school first.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he belong to a recording label?","output":"Yes, Wang Leehom belonged to a recording label.

Summarize this article: Sir Tom Winsor said Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings' decision was based on three \\"misunderstood\\" words in a press release. Mr Crompton was suspended after the Hillsborough inquest verdicts in April. He said the PCC's decision was wrong and he will be taking legal action. Mr Crompton - who was due to retire in November - was suspended the day after the Hillsborough inquests concluded police conduct contributed to or caused the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans in 1989. A statement he issued on 27 April, included the phrase \\"these [police] failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors\\". Dr Billings said the words \\"other contributory factors\\" showed insensitivity to the victims of the disaster. Following the suspension, Dr Billings instigated dismissal proceedings against Mr Crompton under Section 38 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, which required him to consult others on the proposal - among them, Sir Tom. Speaking to the Today programme Sir Tom said: \\"Dr Billings is firing the chief constable for nothing other than three words in a press release which could not fairly mean anything other than he was not blaming the fans.\\" He said the PCC's interpretation of the statement was \\"mistaken and the High Court will correct him\\". \\"The Police and Crime Commissioner cannot fire the chief because people have misunderstood what was said and, let's remember, the PCC was shown the statement before it was made an he did not say 'Do not issue that statement'.\\" In published documents relating to the dismissal proceedings Mr Crompton claims he took the statement to Dr Billings on the morning of 27 April but was told the PCC could not advise on it. According to Dr Billings, Mr Crompton was told it was \\"unwise\\" to make a comment seeking to justify the force's legal stance at the inquests. Summary:","output":"Sir Tom Winsor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary, has criticised the decision to fire South Yorkshire Police Chief David Crompton over his response to the Hillsborough inquest verdicts. Winsor claims that Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Dr. Alan Billings' decision was based on three \\"misunderstood\\" words in a press release, and suggests that the High Court may correct the PCC's interpretation. Crompton plans to take legal action over his suspension, which occurred shortly before his planned retirement in November."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Inside Context: After succumbing to a drug addiction that cost him his job, almost all of his money, and his dignity, Miles Berrett (Luke Goss) is entering his new home: a tiny cell in an old, run-down prison. Determined to get his life back on track, Miles plans to serve his time and make things right with his wife and daughter. While asleep on his bunk during his first night locked up, Miles is ripped awake by a terrifying crash. A moment later, in the dark, guards rush past his cell. Working with Anthony (Paul Rae), the \\"lifer\\" in the cell next to him, Miles tries to determine what is going on, but this is unlike anything that has ever happened in this prison. Soon, Miles and Anthony hear gunfire. And then screaming... the horrible, sickening screams of a man being torn apart. Something bad is happening in this prison. Outside of his cell, through the darkness, Miles can hear other inmates talking, yellingâtrying to figure out what is happening. A voice over a PA system instructs all of the prisoners to remain calm and quiet. \\"There has been a situation. It has been contained.\\" But Miles and Anthony know that is a lie.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the lovers who have a secret romance? ?  Tessibel Skinner is a young woman in a squatter village on the coast, where she lives with her father, a local fisherman. Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick's sister, Teola. Soon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan. Her decision is made for her soon enough, as she receives a letter informing her that Dan has died heroically in a fire at the fraternity. Unable to confide in her very stern father, Teola is distraught and turns to Tess for support. Once the baby is born, Tess agrees to take the child and bear the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock. Upon his return, Frederick is forced to shun Tess for her sin despite his remaining love for her. Soon, however, Teola's baby falls ill and Tess decides to take him up to Elias' church to be baptized. Disgusted by Tess and the child, Elias refuses, shaming them publicly. Teola, having witnessed her father's anger, decides to step forward and admit the truth about her child. Tess is forgiven and it is decided that Teola will die with her son. Meanwhile, the true murderer is found, allowing Tess' father to be released from prison.

I was so-o-o excited,\\" the widow and former duplex dweller said of the purchase of her first home, a sagging frame structure on Snowden. \\"I was glad to get me a house.\\" When James realized she had been swindled she turned to Memphis Area Legal Services, which represented her in a lawsuit. Now, James's monthly house notes have dropped from 796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable 247. Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail. \\"I don't know what I would have done without Legal Services,\\" said James. \\"They solved a lot of my problems.\\" James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS, which provides assistance for civil matters, such as domestic abuse and family-related problems, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, veterans, housing and consumer fraud cases. Like James, most clients are elderly or female. Some are handicapped. Some need medical care or veteran's benefits. Some are trying to escape eviction or an abusive marriage. And 87 percent live at or below poverty level. Shelby County Mayor A C Wharton recently said Legal Services is important for those who, because of poverty or other struggles in life, think justice is an empty word. \\"They must be given reason to believe that the law is for them too,\\" said Wharton, a former executive director of MALS.

The text does not mention that James is handicapped. James fits into the usual clientele of MALS (Memphis Area Legal Services) because she was an elderly woman who had been taken advantage of through a questionable loan program and needed assistance. She needed help with housing and consumer fraud cases, which is something MALS provides assistance for.

Context: The flaw in the Chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence about the UN forces. Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the 5th Marine Regiment (United States), 7th Marine Regiment (United States) and 11th Marine Regiment (United States), to be concentrated at Yudami-ni. Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, where a Douglas C-47 Skytrain-capable airfield was under construction and a supply dump, was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st Marine Regiment (United States) and 7th Marines. Only Task Force Faith (RCT-31), an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir. Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults. As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men at the start of the battle, and it was further reinforced by the British 41 Commando and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and 7th Army Infantry Divisions. The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle. The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War, since the 1st Marine Air Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navys Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy) were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle, while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next. Answer:","output":"FBI agent Jim Block is going to watch Sam Lawton closely as the story progresses. After the North Bay Bridge collapse, Sam successfully persuades several people to leave the bridge, saving their lives. Despite Jim Block's skepticism about Sam's responsibility for the disaster, he promises to keep an eye on him, likely to ensure Sam's involvement in the collapse was not malicious and to monitor any further unusual incidents. As the story continues, the survivors of the bridge collapse start to die in mysterious circumstances. This pattern of deaths draws attention to the possibility of a supernatural force at play, specifically the phenomenon of Death seeking to claim the lives of those who cheated it on the bridge. This concept is further supported by the cryptic warnings given by coroner William Bludworth, who tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated.\\"  Given this context, it becomes evident that Jim Block will be watching Sam Lawton in an attempt to unravel the reasons for the strange coincidences and determine whether Sam has any direct involvement or knowledge of these incidents. Moreover, Block may also be monitoring the behavior of the remaining survivors to ensure their safety and further investigate the mysterious events following the bridge collapse."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Posted on the brand's YouTube channel and Facebook page, the short video features a faceless female surfer waking up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves... but the star of the show is her bottom. Moreover, since the video ends when she paddles out to sea, none of the video actually features any surfing, which fans have found unpalatable. Fans were angered that the OPTIONS: - Australian video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Facebook video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Martha De Lacey video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Roxy video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Roxy Pro Biarritz video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Stephanie Gilmore video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Video video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - YouTube video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin","output":"Fans were angered that the Roxy video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfing. This issue sparked a significant backlash from the brand's target audience, who felt that the video's focus on the surfer's physical appearance rather than her athletic prowess went against the core values that Roxy is meant to represent. As a brand that aims to empower women in the world of surfing, this kind of content was viewed as a step in the wrong direction. The controversy surrounding the video can be attributed to a few key factors. First and foremost, the approach taken in the video was seen as objectifying the female surfer, reducing her to nothing more than a body being showcased for the male gaze – an unfortunate and pervasive problem in the portrayals of women in advertising. Additionally, the fact that the video did not feature any actual surfing further reinforced the perception that the brand was more interested in selling a sexualized image than promoting the sport and the skills of the surfer. In response to this backlash, Roxy should consider reassessing its marketing strategy and ensuring that future content reflects the brand's intended values and mission of empowering women in surf culture. One approach could be to shift the focus from the physical appearance of the athletes to their impressive athletic abilities and achievements. For example, showcasing women successfully riding powerful waves, taking part in competitions, and engaging in other aspects of the surfing community could help to emphasize the importance of women's place in the sport. Moreover, Roxy could work to engage with fans and foster a positive and inclusive dialogue about the representation of women in the world of surfing. Hosting events, creating social media campaigns, and partnering with organizations that advocate for women's equality in sports are just a few ways in which the brand could demonstrate its commitment to supporting female athletes and countering the objectification that often occurs in advertising. In conclusion, the Roxy video controversy highlights the importance of brands staying true to their core values and ensuring that the content they produce is consistent with the message they aim to convey. By refocusing on the athletic prowess of female surfers and prioritizing their empowerment in the sport, Roxy can work to regain the trust of fans and continue to be a symbol of female strength and skill in the surfing world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In an ashram in Varanasi Answer:","output":"Title: The River's Embrace Step 1: Establish the setting and the main characters The movie is set in Varanasi, India, mainly in and around an ashram that houses unwanted widows. Our protagonist, Meera, is a young widow sent to live in the ashram by her in-laws after her husband suddenly passes away. Alongside her, there are several other widows, some older like Mala, who have spent most of their lives in the ashram, and newer ones like Preeti, who is also struggling to adapt to her unwanted new life. Step 2: Introduce conflict A local developer, Mr. Kapoor, wants to seize the ashram land to build a luxury hotel along the riverfront. This threatens the only home the widows have known and forces them to come together to protect their sanctuary. Step 3: Create subplots to add depth Meera develops a romantic interest in Rahul, a local journalist who takes an interest in the widows' plight and wants to expose Mr. Kapoor's plans. Meanwhile, Mala gets diagnosed with a terminal illness, which adds a sense of urgency to their fight to save the ashram. Step 4: Climax As the pressure rises from Mr. Kapoor to vacate the ashram, Meera, Preeti, and the other widows join together to host a large-scale public event celebrating the beauty and history of Varanasi. With the help of Rahul's expose, public opinion turns against Mr. Kapoor, and the government steps in to prevent the ashram's demolition. Step 5: Resolution In the end, the widows emerge triumphant, empowered by their unity and new sense of identity. With the ashram saved, Mala passes away peacefully, leaving her legacy to Meera and her newfound family. Meera and Rahul also explore their budding relationship, challenging societal norms that say widows must not remarry.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","output":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is Handel."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Pick from:  * negative;  * positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the performers are so spot on","output":"The phrase \\"the performers are so spot on\\" can be classified as a positive statement. This is because the term \\"spot on\\" is often used to convey approval or admiration for something, or to express that a situation, object, or performance is accurate or well-executed. In the context of the phrase under consideration, it highlights the exceptional performance of the performers and implies that their delivery has impressed the observer. The observer likely believes that the performers have either met or surpassed their expectations, thereby resulting in an enjoyable experience. In a broader context, positive language often encompasses words or phrases that elicit a sense of satisfaction, appreciation, happiness, or excitement. In contrast, negative language includes statements that induce feelings of unease, disappointment, sadness, or anger. The phrase in question aligns with the general characteristics of positive language, as it implies that the performers have done a great job and have met or exceeded the expectations of the person making the observation. In summary, the phrase \\"the performers are so spot on\\" can be considered positive due to the use of \\"spot on,\\" which indicates the observer's admiration and appreciation for the performers and their presentation.

Question: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Two farms were selling on Seattle markets. Berry farm, which used organic methods, no fertilizers and pesticides, and Rose farm, which used conventional agricultural methods, including fertilizers and pesticides.  Which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the main differences between the two farms: - Berry farm uses organic methods and does not use fertilizers and pesticides. - Rose farm uses conventional agricultural methods and includes fertilizers and pesticides. Step 2: Assess the environmental impact of each farm's methods: - Berry farm:   - Without the use of fertilizers and pesticides, it is unlikely that chemicals from this farm would runoff into nearby rivers or lakes.   - Therefore, the farm has a minimal impact on local water contamination. - Rose farm:   - By using conventional agricultural methods, chemicals in the form of fertilizers and pesticides are applied to the fields.   - These chemicals can be picked up by rainwater and runoff, resulting in the contamination of nearby rivers, lakes, and groundwater.

Summarize: The billionaire has shown in New Hampshire that he can turn publicity, controversy, even notoriety, into a winning margin of votes - indeed, a large winning margin. The Donald is not just hype. The Trump brand clearly works in the political arena. He is not just the ultimate clickbait candidate, a human headline who has blurred the lines between politics and entertainment, but a serious contender with a path to the Republican presidential nomination. How can he possibly win, the question asked last June when he first stepped from the golden doors of the elevators in Trump Tower to announce his long-shot bid for the presidency, has now changed. How can he possibly be stopped? As Donald Trump made the journey down from his executive suite that day he apparently harboured self-doubts, sharing with his wife, Melania, the fear that he might fall flat on his face. But ever the showman, there was no trace of that uncharacteristic lack of confidence when moments later he announced his bid. Rather, he projected supreme self-certainty, the personal magnetism, the winning aura that's so alluring to many of his followers. That day also demonstrated his skills at setting the agenda, and framing the contest. His attack on unauthorised Mexican immigrants, whom he decried as criminals and \\"rapists,\\" had an electrifying effect on his candidacy. Far from disqualifying him from the presidential nomination, they propelled him towards it. They also taught him an early lesson - and an ugly lesson, his critics would say. A hard-line stance on immigration, especially when coupled with fears about national security, is a big vote winner. Months later, when a poll suggested he had fallen behind his right-wing rival Ted Cruz in Iowa, Trump announced his plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering America. Again, his poll numbers soared. Noticeable from the exit polls last night was that two-thirds of Republicans in New Hampshire supported his temporary ban on Muslims. The criticism that he is a racist demagogue, and the acid shower of international criticism especially from Muslims and Hispanics, has done nothing to harm him. Quite the contrary. Early on in his candidacy, Trump also learnt he could defy the usual norms of political engagement. Pundits initially viewed his attack on John McCain, the former prisoner of war and presidential candidate, as suicidal. Picking a fight with Megyn Kelly, Fox News's most luminous star, also seemed like an act of self-harm. But those insults generated controversy and controversy generated high polls numbers. It's been the calculus of his campaign. Monopolising the media coverage had an added bonus - it starved rivals of the spotlight, and meant they were constantly having to react to him rather than setting the terms of the debate themselves. His outspoken attacks also reinforced another of his great selling points, his delight in railing against \\"political correctness\\". These Trump tirades especially resonate with his core support, lower income white males, who earn less than 50,000 a year. The billionaire has enormous blue-collar appeal. For all his boasts and for all his inflated claims, there's an authenticity about Trump which his supporters also find appealing. The Donald is The Donald, just as, incidentally, The Bern is The Bern. At a time when voters globally are rejecting career politicians, Trump is the classic anti-politician. Though at opposite ends of the political spectrum, Trump and Sanders are tapping into the same disenchantment with the elite political class. Paradoxically then, it turns out he's a highly skilled political operator. Transferring his skills as a reality television star to the campaign trail, he's good a revving up a crowd, working a rope-line and glad-handing voters. He's a natural when it comes to the stagecraft of campaigning. Having the Secret Service in tow offering personal protection also gives him something of a presidential aura, and an elongated motorcade to boot. It all helps him project power and success. His message \\"Make America Great Again!\\" is also infectious. As I wrote early in the campaign, he's benefited greatly from tapping into widespread feelings of fear and frustration among voters, but there's also a can-do optimism about his candidacy. His supporters believe he is a guy who makes things happen and gets things done. For Trump, New Hampshire was a double victory. First, he won by a big margin. Second, no rival from the establishment stable of candidates has emerged from New Hampshire as a clear challenger. If the first-in-the-nation primary had gone to script for party elders, Marco Rubio would have built on his strong third place showing in Iowa, where he trailed Trump by just 1% to come third, and come a strong second, or possibly even won. But \\"Marcomentum\\" came to a shuddering halt in the televised debate on Saturday, when, at the hands of Governor Chris Christie, he received a mauling. The young Floridian ended that night with blood in his spitbucket, and a reputation as a political bantamweight. Governor John Kasich of Ohio, who did well in New Hampshire by adopting a similar playbook to John McCain in 2000, is simply too moderate to prosper in the modern-day GOP. It is hard to see him remain viable as the contest moves south, especially in South Carolina which was designed by conservative Republicans to act as a firewall to block moderate candidates like the cheery Ohioan. South Carolina will surely do to Kasich what it did to McCain in 2000, which is to stop him in his tracks. Clues to Trump's success are to be found in his autobiography, The Art of Deal. \\"I play to people's fantasies,\\" he wrote, back in the late-80s. \\"I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration - and a very effective form of promotion.\\" Well currently his \\"truthful hyperbole\\" is propelling him towards the Republican presidential nomination. What many wrote off as fantasy politics is becoming real.","output":"A billionaire named Donald Trump is trying to become the next President of the United States. He is famous and sometimes says things that make a lot of people talk about him. This has helped him become popular with some people. People used to think he couldn't win, but now they wonder if anyone can stop him. He wants to do things like stop people from certain countries coming to America, and this has made even more people like him.

Here is a goal: How do I chill the pureed bananas when making banana ice cream? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of chilling pureed bananas when making banana ice cream, we can follow these steps: 1. First, prepare your bananas: Peel ripe bananas, preferably ones that are showing some brown spots on the skin, as they will have a stronger and sweeter taste. Slice the bananas into smaller pieces for easier blending. 2. Blend the bananas: Place the sliced bananas into a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender or food processor to ensure even blending. Now, we have two main chilling methods to consider: Method 1: Freeze banana slices before blending - This is the preferred and most popular method because it results in a creamier texture. - Start by laying the banana slices on a flat tray or plate lined with parchment paper. This will prevent the banana slices from sticking together. - Place the tray in the freezer and let the bananas freeze for at least 2-3 hours, or until they are solid. - After freezing, blend the banana slices in a food processor or a powerful blender to get the desired creamy consistency. Method 2: Chill the pureed bananas after blending - Place the pureed bananas in a container with an airtight lid. - Put the container in the freezer for approximately 2-3 hours. During this time, you should periodically check on the consistency of the pureed bananas, stirring from time to time to prevent it from becoming too solid and icy. This method may not yield the same creaminess as the first one, but it still works. Both of these methods are suitable for making banana ice cream, but for better texture and creaminess, I would recommend Method 1: Freeze banana slices before blending. Freezing the banana slices first will make the blending process easier and result in a smoother, creamier ice cream texture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Already uncannily similar in looks, Tautou's strong  performance breathes life into Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel, the fiery designer who would found iconic Parisian haute couture house, Chanel. From the way she holds her cigarette to Coco's famously sharp gaze, Tautou is a dead-ringer for the young Coco. \\"She is perfect for the part,\\" Fontaine told CNN. \\"She has this determination and authority.\\" The blue-striped mariner's sweater OPTIONS: - Anne Fontaine wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Audrey Tautou wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - CNN wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Chanel wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Coco wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Coco Avant Chanel wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Coco Chanel wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - England wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Fontaine wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - French wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - LONDON wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Parisian wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Parisien wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. - Tautou wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration.","output":"In \\"Coco Avant Chanel,\\" Audrey Tautou portrays Coco Chanel, the eminent founder of the Parisien haute couture house, Chanel. When Anne Fontaine, the director of the film, envisioned her biopic about the legendary designer, she believed that Audrey Tautou was the perfect fit for the role. Their strikingly similar appearances, coupled with Tautou's powerful performance, make her the ideal actress to bring Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel to life on the screen. Tautou flawlessly captures even the smallest details, from the way Coco holds her cigarette to her signature piercing gaze. Fontaine's faith in Tautou paid off, as the audience sees a determined, authoritative figure brought to life. However, like many biopics, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" is not without its historical inaccuracies. For instance, the blue-striped mariner's sweater that Tautou wears in one scene did not actually come into existence until the 1930s. This discrepancy is important because it signifies that the film is not a direct, faithful adaptation or representation of Coco Chanel's life. Another instance of inaccuracy is the quilted sewing pouch featured in the movie. This particular item is shown to prompt the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag, but in reality, it was not the true inspiration. Such inaccuracies can affect the viewer's perception of Coco Chanel's journey in the fashion world, as the film may not be an entirely accurate portrayal of her life and work. Despite these deviations from the truth, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" still manages to provide a captivating insight into the life of the legendary designer, giving viewers a glimpse of her fiery spirit and her trajectory in the world of haute couture. Audrey Tautou's captivating performance as Coco Chanel plays a crucial role in the film's success, demonstrating her remarkable abilities as an actress and her capacity to immerse herself in complex, historical roles. In conclusion, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" is an engaging biopic that, despite some historical inaccuracies, captures the essence of Coco Chanel's life and career. Audrey Tautou's brilliant portrayal of the iconic designer is instrumental in bringing her to life on the screen, showcasing not only her own talents as an actress but also the fascinating journey of one of the most influential figures in the world of fashion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Danny Oliver’s last shift ended with the veteran Sacramento sheriff’s deputy doing something he would have done countless times before in his career, walking toward a car to see what the occupants were doing on his beat.      The 47-year-old father of two never made it to the driver’s window Friday. At about 10:30 a.m., a man armed with an AR-15 rifle aimed out of the car from the parking lot of a Motel 6 at Arden Way and Ethan Way and opened fire, killing Oliver with a shot to the forehead.      Over the next six hours, authorities say, 34-year-old gunman Marcelo Marquez eluded hundreds of officers from Sacramento to Auburn in a crime spree that left Oliver and Placer County sheriff’s Detective Michael David Davis Jr. dead. A third Placer deputy, Jeff Davis, was wounded and later treated and released from a hospital. A motorist was in serious condition from a gunshot to the head.      The carnage ended around 4 p.m., when Marquez meekly surrendered to deputies who converged on a home in Auburn where he had been hiding for hours as one of the largest manhunts in Sacramento history unfolded.

SUBSCRIBE NOW      Marquez, who public records indicate is from Salt Lake City, was expected to be transferred to the Sacramento County jail late Friday along with a woman who authorities say had accompanied him on part of his rampage.      She was identified as Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento, although public records online suggest she is Marquez’s wife and that the couple are from West Valley City, Utah.      Authorities say the couple were responsible for a drama that forced thousands of schoolchildren to spend the day either in lockdown or sheltering in place, left neighborhoods evacuated and forced sheriffs from Sacramento and Placer counties to step forward with somber announcements that they both had lost deputies.      Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said the incident was a “perfect storm” of violence by a gunman who had no regard for the public or law enforcement.      “It’s incredibly dangerous,” Jones said. “If the suspect is willing to shoot an officer – unprovoked – then no one is safe.”      Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner appeared anguished as he later described the loss of Davis, a homicide investigator and 15-year veteran of the department who would have turned 43 on Wednesday. Davis’ father, Michael David Davis Sr., was a Riverside sheriff’s deputy killed in the line of duty 26 years earlier – to the day.      “The suspect is in custody, as you know,” Bonner said quietly. “I think there’s those people who would say, ‘Well, you know what, I wish you’d killed him.’      “No, that’s not who we are, we are not him. We did our job. I’m incredibly proud of the men and women who go out there every day and put their life on the line, and today this organization, this family, has suffered a horrific loss.”      Gov. Jerry Brown issued a statement Friday night about the fatal shootings:      “The brutal murders of Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver and Sheriff’s Detective Michael Davis are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices we demand of our peace officers and the incredible courage they display as they protect our communities. Anne and I extend our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of these two brave public servants. We also are mindful of the officer and bystanders who were wounded or terrorized by today’s terrible events.”      The ordeal began at the Motel 6 near Sacramento’s bustling Arden Fair mall and a popular movie theater complex.      Oliver and his partner were approaching a car in the motel parking lot that had a man and woman inside when the gunman suddenly opened fire, Jones said.      “As the officer approached the vehicle, the person inside the vehicle fired several rounds at Officer Danny Oliver,” the sheriff said in an afternoon press conference. “At least one of those rounds struck Deputy Oliver in the forehead, which caused his death.”      Oliver didn’t have time to react, but his partner drew his weapon and opened fire as the suspects fled the parking lot.      One witness, Tomorrow Jones, said she spent the night at the motel to celebrate her anniversary and that her family and baby were still in the second-floor room when she heard the barrage of gunfire.      “If you snuck outside you could see him lying there,” she said. “I heard the shots, like nine of them. It was terrible.”      She added that responding emergency crews performed chest compressions on the fallen officer before he was placed on a gurney and taken to a hospital.      The suspects drove a short distance away, to the 700 block of Howe Avenue. There, they tried to carjack a vehicle driven by a man who apparently resisted and was shot in the head, then fell back into his vehicle.      That victim was identified as Anthony Holmes, 38, who was listed in serious condition Friday night at the UC Davis Medical Center.      The suspects fled that parking lot into a nearby neighborhood, where they carjacked yet another vehicle, this one a white Ford Mustang convertible, then raced a few blocks away to a home on Coronado Boulevard at Castec Drive, where they encountered Jose Cruz, a gardener working on a home.      “I need a favor,” the man told Cruz as he pointed a pistol at him with his right hand and held his left arm wrapped in a bloody shirt.      “What’s the favor?” Cruz asked.      “I need your keys,” the gunman said. “Hurry up, because they’re chasing me. Hurry up. I don’t want to hurt you.”      The suspect then helped Cruz unhitch a trailer full of gardening equipment from the truck, and he and the woman raced off to Fair Oaks Boulevard and, within minutes, a Carmichael neighborhood.      There, a county park ranger spotted them changing clothes and alerted authorities, who raced to Van Alstine Avenue and cordoned off a neighborhood.      But they were too late. By then, the pickup truck was racing up Interstate 80 and exited at Auburn, where the occupants pulled over to the side of the road and two Placer County deputies spotted it.      The deputies approached but immediately were met with gunfire from an AR-15 rifle, authorities said, striking both of the officers. Both were taken to the Sutter Roseville Medical Center, where Michael David Davis Jr. later died.      Steven Morris was at an Auburn city park when authorities began flooding the area after those shootings. He said he saw dozens of officers with assault rifles, guns drawn, standing on the beds of pickup trucks circling downtown Auburn.      “I’ve only seen that in Mexico,” he said. “No one knew what was going on.”      Monroy was arrested at that scene, and authorities said a pistol was found in her purse. However, they added that they believe Marquez did all the firing during Friday’s events.      As Monroy was being arrested, Marquez fled into a residential area near Placer High School, forcing that school and others to lock down their campuses, authorities said.      The gunman took refuge inside a home on Belmont Drive while a massive law enforcement response that included several helicopters converged on the area.      “It’s terrifying to find that it’s happening on your street, it’s happening on my street in my quiet little neighborhood,” resident Donna Silva said later.      Silva was at Skyridge Elementary School, where her 7-year-old twins attend school, when she learned that the campus and others in Auburn had been locked down.      “It’s a scary feeling not to be able to get to your kids,” Silva said. “I look forward to giving them a big kiss.”      The area around Belmont Drive bristled with heavily armed officers, armored vehicles and reinforcements from virtually every agency in the region.      CHP officers carrying automatic rifles stood roadside. A SWAT team staged on Gum Street and at Pacific Street, and armed Roseville police checked the car trunks of passing motorists before allowing them to drive through.      Authorities evacuated Placer High School after 3 p.m., with the first group of students slowly making their way onto school buses as Placer County sheriff’s deputies carrying automatic rifles stood guard.      “It looks like a TV show around here,” Hazel Haase, who lives next door to the home where Marquez was hiding, said by telephone during the siege.      Haase said heavily armed officers came into her yard a little after 1 p.m. with their guns drawn.      For the next three hours, officers carefully tightened the noose around the neighborhood, focusing SWAT teams on the home and contacting the homeowner, who helped draw a floor plan of the home for deputies.      At the same time, officers searched the rugged canyon areas near the home, fearful that Marquez might have been able to slip away.      While they still were searching for the suspect, Sheriff Jones was holding a 3 p.m. news conference in downtown Sacramento to reveal that Oliver had died. Although sources had confirmed in the morning that the deputy had not survived, Jones held off because Oliver’s wife was out of town and had to be reached, then fly back to Sacramento.      Jones called Oliver an “outstanding officer,” part of a tight-knit group of problem-oriented policing officers who try to improve citizens’ quality of life by taking a proactive approach to problems.      Oliver spent 12 years in the POP unit, and three years in the jail before that.      Former Sheriff John McGinness said Oliver was a “passionate, good soul” who loved being a deputy.      In Auburn, meanwhile, scanner traffic that had been describing efforts to capture the suspect suddenly went silent.      After about 45 minutes of minimal traffic, the scanner came back to life just before 4 p.m. with a simple announcement: “He’s cuffed,” a dispatcher said.      Officers had entered the home and arrested Marquez, apparently without him putting up a struggle.      He was taken away on a gurney and transported by ambulance for a checkup, then to jail. ||||| Sign up and get access to special features Connect to your Facebook or Twitter account and we'll fill in your registration information.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on...

Add spaces: Pistonpumpsystem,variableflow0-90liter/min.","output":"The given text is \\"Pistonpumpsystem,variableflow0-90liter/min.\\" Let's add appropriate spaces to separate the words and make it more understandable. Here's the text with added spaces: \\"Piston pump system, variable flow 0-90 liter/min.\\" Now, let me provide a detailed explanation of each of the components of this text. 1. Piston pump system: A piston pump is a type of positive displacement pump that uses a piston mechanism to move fluids through a system. This type of pump can generate high pressures and is commonly used in applications involving water, oil, or other fluids with low compressibility. The primary components of a piston pump system include the piston, cylinder, suction valve, and discharge valve. When the piston moves up, the suction valve opens, allowing fluid to enter the cylinder. When the piston moves down, the discharge valve opens, forcing the fluid out of the cylinder and into the system. Piston pump systems are popular for their reliability, efficiency, and ability to handle high-pressure applications. 2. Variable flow: Variable flow refers to a system's ability to adjust the flow rate of a fluid within a particular range. This feature is important in applications where precise control of the fluid flow is necessary, such as in process control systems or when working with fluids of varying viscosities. In a piston pump system, the variable flow can be achieved through the use of a variable displacement piston pump or by altering the speed of the piston movement within the pump. This versatility allows the system to be more adaptable and suitable for a wide range of applications. 3. 0-90 liter/min: This numerical range represents the flow rate capacity of the piston pump system. In this case, the pump can handle a fluid flow rate between 0 to 90 liters per minute. This is a helpful piece of information for understanding the performance capabilities of the pump and determining if it is appropriate for a specific application. A higher flow rate means that the pump can move more fluid through the system, increasing its performance and efficiency. Conversely, a lower flow rate might be desirable when precision is more important than speed. In summary, the given text \\"Piston pump system, variable flow 0-90 liter/min.\\" describes a piston pump system capable of handling a variable flow rate between 0 and 90 liters per minute. This type of system offers versatility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in industries that require the movement and control of fluids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds.

While they may seem similar and both are mentioned to be purely defined by software, they are not entirely the same. 1. A \\"virtual instrument\\" is a type of software that imitates the function of an actual, physical instrument. It relates to the idea of using software to replicate the functionalities and interfaces of traditional hardware devices, such as synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and other types of electronic musical instruments. Virtual instruments mainly use software-based processing engines to generate sounds and music. 2. A \\"synthetic instrument\\", on the other hand, is a type of software-simulated device that is designed to mimic the behavior of a physical system by using mathematical models and algorithms. They are mainly used in electronics testing and measurement, where the idea is to use software to mimic the behavior of a physical device or system under test. So, while both virtual and synthetic instruments are defined by software, the applications and principles behind these concepts are different. Virtual instruments primarily focus on the emulation of musical hardware for audio production and live performances. Synthetic instruments, however, are more about simulating the behavior of a physical system for testing and measurement purposes.

Spielberg, Austria (CNN) -- Inside the Red Bull Ring -- home to the returning Austrian Grand Prix -- Mercedes toreadors Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in Sunday's race. Hamilton flew from ninth to fourth by the end of the first lap to once again put himself into a fight with his teammate and chief world title rival.

It was heralded as a fresh start after last season's torrid time under David Moyes, and nobody can deny Louis van Gaal's arrival at Manchester United has had its ups and downs. But after the 1-0 defeat in the Manchester derby on Sunday, United sat in 10th place in the Premier League, which they have won 13 times. They are undoubtedly struggling to adjust, and a depleted back line makes the outlook up to Christmas bleak. Records have been smashed, and not the type Sir Alex Ferguson used to break with pride. Here, Sportsmail brings you the worst... Manchester United players look dejected after Sergio Aguero struck City's winner in the second half United had five players sent off in","output":"the first half of the season, a new club record that further highlighted the squad's lack of discipline and unity. Players like Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford felt the pressure of their newfound roles, but young stars like Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams continued to show promise. As the season pressed on, United's injury crisis only worsened, leading to increased reliance on their academy players. Despite their resilience and occasional flashes of brilliance, they struggled to find consistency and put together a string of quality performances. Although Louis van Gaal's philosophy and tactics were initially met with excitement, fans and pundits alike began to question his defensive-minded approach. Desperate for change, van Gaal tried to implement more attacking formations, but the lack of firepower and creativity in the squad made it difficult to execute his vision. As the January transfer window approached, van Gaal knew he had to strengthen his squad. Manchester United brought in a few fresh faces, including an experienced centre-back and a creative midfielder. These signings injected some much-needed energy into the team, and performances started to improve. The Red Devils managed to claw their way back up the table, but their earlier setbacks made it near impossible to secure a top-four finish. However, United did manage to reach the final of the FA Cup, giving the team and their supporters a chance to end the season on a high note. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United faced off against a formidable opponent. The match was a thrilling, back-and-forth affair that showcased both teams' attacking prowess. In the dying moments of extra time, a piece of magic from one of United's new signings sealed a dramatic 2-1 victory and brought the trophy back to Old Trafford. Ultimately, the season was a rollercoaster ride for Manchester United. Although they failed to secure a Champions League spot, their FA Cup triumph provided a glimmer of hope for the future. Amidst the turmoil, Louis van Gaal's signings and belief in youth development laid the foundation for the team's gradual return to domestic and European dominance in the seasons to come. As the Red Devils lifted the FA Cup trophy, the United faithful knew that while it was far from perfect, the season marked the beginning of a new era and a step in the right direction. And so, the story of Manchester United's turbulent campaign under Louis van Gaal ended on an optimistic note, filled with promise and hope for a brighter tomorrow."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the truth value of the second sentence when considering the first sentence being true, we need to analyze each sentence and understand their context: Sentence 1: \\"Consider a program of discounts for presortation.\\" This sentence asks us to think about or entertain the idea of a program that offers discounts for presortation (sorting in advance). Sentence 2: \\"Don't consider any programs.\\" This sentence instructs us not to think about or entertain the idea of any programs. Step by step analysis: 1. Assume that Sentence 1 is true. So, we are considering a \\"program of discounts for presortation.\\" 2. Now, we need to determine whether Sentence 2 is true or not based on Sentence 1 being true. Since Sentence 1 (which we deemed to be true) asks us to consider a specific program, and Sentence 2 asks us not to consider any programs, there is a contradiction. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 cannot be true at the same time, as it contradicts the first sentence.

Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? no laughs","output":"Based on the provided review, which states \\"no laughs,\\" it can be inferred that the opinion of the movie being reviewed is negative. The phrasing implies that the movie did not provide any comedic moments or humor, which might have been expected or desired by the reviewer. A more detailed explanation for the negative opinion is as follows: It is possible that the movie being reviewed is of a comedy genre or was marketed as a light-hearted film. If that is the case, then a movie that contains \\"no laughs\\" would not meet the intentions, investments, or expectations of both the intended audience and the reviewer. In this circumstance, viewers would likely go into the movie with hopes for an entertaining, amusing experience. If the movie fails to provide such comic relief, viewers would undoubtedly feel disappointed, which is evident in the reviewer's choice of stating \\"no laughs.\\"  Furthermore, the term \\"no laughs\\" could speak to other components of the movie, such as the script, direction, or acting. When a movie fails to provide entertainment through laughter, it may signify that the film's dialogue lacks wit, that the timing fails to highlight comedic moments, or that the characters and/or situations are not funny or relatable. Additionally, the film's blending of humor might not be in line with the reviewer's taste. Such an issue may explain the negative opinion in the review. Moreover, the negative opinion stemming from \\"no laughs\\" might extend to the movie's general appeal across multiple genres. Even if the film is not categorized as solely comedic, humorous moments can elevate other genres -- like action, drama, romance, or thriller -- by providing lighter scenes and character interactions that allow viewers to emotionally connect with the story. Movies that fail to offer comic relief might come off as lackluster or monotonous, and as a result, the reviewer would hold a more negative opinion. This short review of \\"no laughs,\\" therefore, suggests a more significant dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the movie: genre expectations, script or screenplay, direction, acting, or the overall entertainment value for the reviewer. These factors contribute to a negative opinion of the movie being reviewed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways.  Which country caused the formation of hypoxia?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is more likely that Italy caused the formation of hypoxia in the sea. While both Croatia and Italy polluted the sea in different ways, the primary cause of hypoxia is the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals which are often the result of agricultural activities. Croatia, with its economy based on tourism and fishing, would potentially be more focused on maintaining the cleanliness and aesthetic appeal of its waters to attract tourists. This could involve stricter regulations on waste disposal and lesser emissions of harmful chemicals into the sea. Nevertheless, it may still contribute to marine pollution through marine debris, such as floating waste from tourists and fishing activities. Italy, on the other hand, has its economy primarily based on conventional agriculture. Agricultural activities often involve the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and various other chemicals to maximize crop production. When these chemicals are washed into rivers and eventually into the ocean, they can lead to an excessive influx of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients then lead to algal blooms, which eventually decay and consume large amounts of oxygen. This process results in hypoxia, where oxygen levels in the water become critically low, creating dead zones that are unable to support most marine life. Moreover, Italy's agriculture also includes livestock farming, which can generate significant amounts of animal waste. When this waste reaches the rivers and the ocean, it contributes to further oxygen depletion due to the high levels of organic matter that also demand oxygen for decomposition. Additionally, human waste from Italy, if not properly managed, can contribute to marine pollution and exacerbate hypoxia conditions. In conclusion, it is more likely that Italy, with its conventional agriculture-based economy, caused the formation of hypoxia in the sea due to the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from agriculture fertilizers, livestock, and human waste. While Croatia does contribute to marine pollution, the nature of its economy does not inherently lead to hypoxia to the same extent as Italy's agricultural practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What year was the last recording session of the man who attempted to curb his alcohol intake?  On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

Q:According to a report by the China News Weekly, They pursue many of their activities in the office building, eating, doing exercise, resting, playing games or even dating. In large cities such as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing, where economy is developing at a fast speed, office workers face an increasing work pressure day by day and many of them have begun to make office their home. As the young generation in society, most of them are aged between 25 and 45. In the eyes of outsiders, they enjoy a comfortable life: they lead the fashion trend in the city and earn a high salary; they enjoy a flexible working schedule and a very good working environment; having a good education background, they don't have to worry that one day they will lose their jobs. However, only the white collars themselves know what others see as a good life is in fact a boring life. They often work extra hours, suffer from loss of creative ability and have little time to make friends. When they go off from work late at night, somethimes they might think of asking for a leave the next day and having a holiday somewhere. However, when a new day begins, they find everything back to normal and themselves pushed by new tasks. In fact, even if they don't work extra hours in the office, they have no place to go. Many of the young people are fresh from college, or have come to work in large cities from their hometowns. As newcomers, they haven't established  a social network. They have few friends to go dating. Meanwhile, many of them face a great pressure for earning money to buy a house or a car.

The reasons mentioned in the passage related to their need for a break are: A) They have to continue to stay at the office after work - The passage mentions that office workers often work extra hours and therefore spend much of their time in the office, making the office feels like home. B) They feel more and more difficult to think up a good idea - According to the passage, due to increasing work pressure, these workers suffer from a loss of creative ability, which may be a result of stress and fatigue. D) They have little time to make friends - As they work long hours and stay in the office for most of their day, these workers have limited time for socializing, making friends, or dating. This lack of a social network can also contribute to their feelings of isolation and boredom, and ultimately, their desire for a break or rest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: buy lots of alcoholic drinks for Riley, leave the club with the new man, be concerned about the strange man","output":"Based on the context provided, it is difficult to predict with certainty Robin's next actions, as they will depend largely on Robin's personality and the dynamics within their friendship with Riley. However, here are potential scenarios detailing possible reactions for each of the proposed answers: 1. Buy lots of alcoholic drinks for Riley: If Robin is a supportive and wingman-like friend, they might choose to buy drinks for Riley and the handsome man in order to help facilitate conversation and socializing between them. This could be especially true if Robin believes that their friend is a bit shy or could use a confidence boost in this situation. In this case, Robin's goal would be to create a friendly and comfortable atmosphere for Riley and the man to get to know each other better, while also enjoying the club environment. 2. Leave the club with the new man: This option suggests that Robin may be the type of friend who would prioritize their own enjoyment and interests over their friend's. In this scenario, Robin might see an opportunity to have fun with this handsome man or may be looking to have their own exciting adventure during their night at the club. This could also indicate that Robin trusts Riley to take care of themselves, and believes they don't need any further assistance or support in getting to know the man. 3. Be concerned about the strange man: In this scenario, Robin may be a more protective and cautious friend who is concerned about Riley's safety and well-being. Robin could be worried that the handsome man has ulterior motives or could potentially pose a threat to Riley. In this case, Robin's main priority would be ensuring that Riley remains safe and feels comfortable throughout the evening. This may involve Robin staying close to Riley, carefully observing the man's behavior, or even intervening if they sense any danger or uncomfortable vibes. Each of these options reflects different aspects of Robin's personality and their relationship with Riley, and their next action will ultimately depend on these factors.

He was in the midst of a two-week run at Birdland and was gearing up to record the famed John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album, which he did on March 7. But there was a session the day before that was the stuff of legend, until now.      On Wednesday, March 6, Coltrane and the quartet went to Van Gelder Studios in Englewood, NJ and cut a complete album's worth of material, including several original compositions that were never recorded elsewhere. They spent the day committing these to tape, taking time with some, rehearsing them two, three times, playing them in different ways and in different configurations.      At the end of the day, Coltrane left Van Gelder Studios with a reference tape and brought it to the home in Queens that he shared with his wife, Naima. These tapes remained untouched for the next 54 years until Impulse! approached the family about finally releasing this lost album. Though the master tape was never found—Rudy Van Gelder wasn't one for clutter—the reference tape was discovered to be in excellent condition.      As the legendary saxophonist Sonny Rollins so rightly put it, \\"This is like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid.\\" The musical implications of this album, the original compositions, the arrangements, the band, the year it was recorded, all amount to a rediscovery and re-contextualization of one of the most important musicians of our time.      Danny Bennett, President and CEO of the Verve Label Group and home of Impulse! records, says, \\"Jazz is more relevant today than ever. It's becoming the alternative music of the 21st century, and no one embodies the boundary-breaking essence of jazz more than John Coltrane. He was a visionary who changed the course of music, and this lost album is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. It gives us insight into his creative process and connects us to his artistry. This album is a cultural moment and the release coincides perfectly with our relaunch of the iconic Impulse! label.\\"      On this album, there are two completely unknown and never-before-heard originals. \\"Untitled Original 11383\\" and \\"Untitled Original 11386,\\" both played on soprano sax. \\"11383\\" features an arco bass solo by Jimmy Garrison, a relative rarity, and \\"11386\\" marks a significant structural change for the quartet, in that they keep returning to the theme between solos, not typical in the quartet's repertoire.      In addition to the two unheard originals, \\"One Up, One Down\\" – released previously only on a bootleg recording from Birdland – is heard here as a studio recording for the first and only time. It contains a fascinating exchange between Elvin Jones and Coltrane.      \\"Impressions,\\" one of Coltrane's most famous and oft-recorded compositions, is played here in a piano-less trio. In fact, McCoy Tyner lays out a number of times during this recording session. It's one of the more interesting aspects of this session and reflects the harmonic possibilities that Coltrane was known to be discussing regularly with Ornette Coleman around this time.      This studio session also yielded Coltrane's first recording of \\"Nature Boy,\\" which he would record again in 1965, and the two versions differ greatly. The one we know is exploratory, meandering. This version is tight, solo-less and clocking in at just over three minutes. The other non-original composition on the album is \\"Vilia,\\" from Franz Lehár's operetta \\"The Merry Widow\\". The soprano version on the Deluxe Edition is the only track from this session to have been previously released.      This incredible, once-in-a-lifetime discovery reveals a number of creative balances at work, like developing original melodies while rethinking familiar standards. Trying out some tunes first on tenor saxophone, then on soprano. Using older techniques like the arpeggio runs of his \\"sheets of sound\\" while experimenting with false fingerings and other newer sounds. This session was pivotal, though to call it such overlooks the fact Coltrane was ever on pivot, always pushing the pedal down while still calling on older, tested ideas and devices.      Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album is a major addition to the Coltrane catalogue and the most important jazz discovery in recent memory.      This historic session resulted in 14 tracks in total. On the standard edition, there are 7 takes, chosen by Ravi Coltrane. The rest of the takes exist on the second disc of the deluxe set. There will be a standard CD and LP and a deluxe CD and LP available on June 29 on Impulse! The deluxe edition will exist on all digital streaming platforms as well.      Impulse!

This was a ground-shaking band, an almost physical being, bearing a promise that seemed to reach far beyond music.      The quartet’s relationship to the studio, however, was something different. In the years leading up to “A Love Supreme,” his explosive 1965 magnum opus, Coltrane produced eight albums for Impulse! Records featuring the members of his so-called classic quartet — the bassist Jimmy Garrison, the drummer Elvin Jones and the pianist McCoy Tyner — but only two of those, “Coltrane” and “Crescent,” were earnest studio efforts aimed at distilling the band’s live ethic.      But now that story needs a major footnote.      On Friday, Impulse! will announce the June 29 release of “Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album,” a full set of material recorded by the quartet on a single day in March 1963, then eventually stashed away and lost. The family of Coltrane’s first wife, Juanita Naima Coltrane, recently discovered his personal copy of the recordings, which she had saved, and brought it to the label’s attention. ||||| A lost album of originals by John Coltrane, the American saxophonist who took jazz to new heights of freedom and expression, has been unearthed.      The album, being released on 29 June as Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album, was recorded in a session on 6 March 1963, at the Van Gelder studios in New Jersey. Joining Coltrane in the quartet that also recorded classic albums such as A Love Supreme, Coltrane, and Ballads, are Jimmy Garrison on double bass, Elvin Jones on drums, and McCoy Tyner on piano.      The master tape left in the studio was lost, and it’s likely it was destroyed in the early 70s when the label, Impulse!, was trying to reduce storage fees. But Coltrane gave his own reference tape of the recording to his wife Naima, despite their then disintegrating relationship – the pair divorced in 1966, and the tape has stayed in her family’s possession ever since.      Sonny Rollins, a peer of Coltrane’s and also regarded as one of the greatest jazz saxophonists of all time, described the discovery as “like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid”.      Among the seven tracks are two completely unheard original compositions, called Untitled Original 11383 and Untitled Original 11386, both of which are played on soprano saxophone. Another composition, One Up, One Down, has been heard only in a live bootleg from the Birdland jazz club, and never before in this studio version.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Coltrane quartet … from left, John Coltrane, Elvin Jones, Jimmy Garrison, McCoy Tyner. Photograph: Jim Marshall Photography LLC      The sessions capture Coltrane at a crucial juncture in his music. It was still two years before Ascension, where he opened up his quartet into an experimental, spiritually minded big band, but he was already heading towards its “free jazz” sound. Impressions (1963), recorded across the previous two years, features some unmoored and raw soloing quite different from the previous bebop era. Nevertheless, he was still in love with melody: Ballads, recorded during the same period and also released in 1963, features some of his most accessible material.      The 11386 recording similarly sees the quartet play in a traditional style, revisiting a melodic chorus theme between solos, and the album also features Coltrane’s first, never before heard version of Nat King Cole’s Nature Boy – unlike the freer 1965 version, the Both Directions at Once version is a straight three-minute take without solos.      Ben Ratliff, former New York Times jazz writer and author of Coltrane: the Story of a Sound, told the Guardian: “This is Coltrane’s quartet starting to move into the last stages of their stable and authoritative phase, when they were often playing the same handful of songs. There’s no concept or grand design here. But he’s trying some new tunes, and playing a strange blues, and fine-tuning Impressions – and that’s a lot.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cover artwork for John Coltrane’s Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album. Photograph: Impulse!      Both Directions at Once was recorded at an intensely fertile time for Coltrane and his quartet – as well as Ballads and Impressions, he also released a collaboration with Duke Ellington in 1963. The lost session was recorded during a two-week run of shows at Birdland – Coltrane played the club straight after the session – and the following day, 7 March, he recorded the album John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman with the jazz singer (its tracklisting changed on the way to the studio, after the pair heard Nat King Cole singing Lush Life on the radio and decided to include their own version).      Saxophonist Wayne Shorter, interviewed for the album’s liner notes, says the title Both Directions at Once came from a compositional tip Coltrane gave to him: “about starting a sentence in the middle, and then going to the beginning and the end of it at the same time.” The Guardian’s jazz critic John Fordham finds another meaning: “Coltrane was looking back at bebop – the virtuosity and melodic resources of which he had stretched to breaking point – and the song-based lyricism of jazz he had recently explored with Duke Ellington, and was about to with Johnny Hartman. But he was also looking forward to imagining the more intense, mantra-like, spiritually-driven music that produced A Love Supreme in 1964.”      British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker meanwhile told the Guardian: “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.” He picked out Coltrane’s interplay with drummer Elvin Jones as being “the core of the music ... which reached astonishing levels of intuitive understanding.”      Ratliff adds that “most of all, Both Directions at Once is a study in how seriously strong the band was, and how powerful his intent, or his concentration, had become.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A long-lost album by famous jazz saxophonist John Coltrane has been found and will be released on June 29.

The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.

Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras.

Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor.

If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film, its theme was (literally) drowned out by the emphasis on \\"special effects\\" over characterization. Almost as if in an attempt to \\"keep up\\" with the rest of the summer action blockbusters, Disney has ditched the character-driven, movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a Star Wars \\"shoot-'em-up\\" with stereotype heroes and villains. The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images (CGI) of flying fish-craft and submarines to fill the gap. They are wrong, and the days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line CGI. This movie is all spectacle with no heart. At times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz. Another problem with the movie is the pacing. It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated. The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch (voiced well by Michael J. Fox) and is left thinking \\"Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to Atlantis\\". Unfortunately, not much happens. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves \\"Now what was that all about? What was the point of the movie? Why couldn't the surviving Atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the \\"present\\" day? And WHY did Atlantis sink?\\" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. There is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets. The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the (spoiler) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people!?! The crew are a collection of quirky, 2-dimensional people of anachronistically (for 1914) P.C. race and gender. The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny short. Most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles (when the characters speak Atlantean). In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were, then why should you care? Again, the movie has no feelings on any level. Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well. Sadly, Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. We also hope that the upcoming \\"Treasure Planet\\", a sci-fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\", will have more heart to it than the unfathomable \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\". Would you say this review is positive or negative?

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F.  and a hint : White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.  Please answer this question : Will being sick with a bacterial infection cause a person's body temperature to increase or decrease? A:","output":"Being sick with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, will cause a person's body temperature to increase. This is due to the immune system's response to fight the infection.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc.  - A twig is a small thin terminal branch of a woody plant. The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away. The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig.   - Seaweed refers to several species of macroscopic, multicellular, marine algae.  - A zygote (from Greek  \\"zygtos\\" \\"joined\\" or \\"yoked\\", from  \\"zygoun\\" \\"to join\\" or \\"to yoke\\"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. The zygote's genome is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: ,  - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race +  - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree)  a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.  - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants.  - A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae and/or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi in a symbiotic relationship. The combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms. Lichens come in many colours, sizes, and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), or other growth forms. A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens. Here, \\"macro\\" and \\"micro\\" do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word \\"moss\\" (e.g., \\"Reindeer moss\\", \\"Iceland moss\\"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant. Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do but like plants they produce their own food by photosynthesis using solar energy, from carbon dioxide, water and minerals in their environment. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites but instead use the plants as a substrate.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - Sponges are the basalmost clade of animals of the phylum Porifera (meaning \\"pore bearer\\". They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes. Overview. Sponges are similar to other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the osculum. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide. All sponges are sessile aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding .  - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.  - Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities.  - Members of the Monoblepharidomycetes have a filamentous thallus that is either extensive or simple and unbranched . They frequently have a holdfast at the base . In contrast to other taxa in their phylum , some reproduce using autospores , although many do so through zoospores . Oogamous sexual reproduction may also occur . In addition to the type genus , the order Monoblepharidales includes Harpochytrium and Oedogoniomyces .  - Myxogastria/Myxogastrea (myxogastrids, ICZN) or Myxomycetes (ICBN), is a grouping of slime molds that contains 5 orders, 14 families, 62 genera and 888 species. They are colloquially known as the plasmodial or acellular slime moulds.  - Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in twelve haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.  - Thallus (plural: thalli), from Latinized Greek  (\\"thallos\\"), meaning \\"a green shoot\\" or \\"twig,\\" is the undifferentiated vegetative tissue of some organisms in diverse groups such as algae, fungi, some liverworts, lichens, and the Myxogastria. Many of these organisms were previously known as the thallophytes, a polyphyletic group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called thalloid, thallodal, thalliform, thalline, or thallose.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).  - Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata). The name comes from the Greek word \\"krinon\\", \\"a lily\\", and \\"eidos\\", \\"form\\". They live in both shallow water and in depths as great as . Those crinoids which, in their adult form, are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk are commonly called sea lilies. The unstalked forms are called feather stars or comatulids.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm.  - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.  - A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate.   - The thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-mobile organisms traditionally described as \\"thalloid plants\\", \\"relatively simple plants\\" or \\"lower plants\\". They were a defunct division of kingdom Plantae that included fungus, lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes, bacteria and the Myxomycota. Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also called Cryptogamae (together with ferns), as opposed to Phanerogamae. The thallophytes are defined as having undifferentiated bodies (thalli), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems.  - A gamete (from Ancient Greek  \\"gamete\\" from gamein \\"to marry\\") is a cell that fuses with another cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gametecalled an ovum (or egg)and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like typecalled a sperm. This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.  - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\".    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'class'.

At age 16, he played bass in a blues band called Frankie Starr and the Chill Factor, which disbanded by 1995. Initially, Arthur sought to become a noted bass guitarist, stating: \\"I never started singing until I was in my early 20s. I remember thinking, 'OK - I am not a singer, I am a musician.' I wanted to be this like heroic bass player so I listened to people like Jaco Pastorius, to Bitches Brew over and over again. And then like Nirvana came out and I was blown away and then I got into Bob Dylan. Around that time I started playing acoustic guitar and realized I could actually write songs if I wasn't playing complicated bass lines.\\"  Joseph graduated from Firestone High School in 1990 and continued developing his music. In the early 1990s, Arthur relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, continuing to record home demos, playing local clubs and working as a guitar salesman at Clark Music Store.  In 1996, Peter Gabriel's A&R associate Harvey Schartz presented Gabriel with a demo of Arthur's first EP, Cut and Blind. Gabriel and Schwartz arranged a live audition at The Fez nightclub in New York City, and Arthur flew up from Atlanta. The night was a success; not only was Lou Reed a guest in the audience, but within a few months Arthur was officially signed, making him the first American recording artist signed to Gabriel's label. Arthur recorded his debut album at Gabriel's Real World Studios in England with producer Markus Dravs (Bjork, Coldplay, Arcade Fire). The debut album Big City Secrets was released worldwide in spring 1997, and Arthur joined Gabriel's WOMAD tour in Europe. Big City Secrets displayed Arthur's often angsty and emotionally wrought lyrics coupled with diverse instrumentation, which he himself described as \\"someone struggling to heal over experimental folk-rock\\", but went virtually unnoticed by the mainstream. Two years later, he recorded an EP called Vacancy, which earned him a Grammy nomination in 2000 for best recording package.

News article: Major Ottawa roads affected by construction starting Sunday Some of the ways to get in and out of Ottawa's core will be different starting Sunday thanks to light rail-related construction. The Transitway is closing from Laurier Avenue to Lees station, including the Campus station at the University of Ottawa, so the bus-only road can be converted to light rail lines. Buses will then move to Nicholas Street, meaning a bus-only lane is being set up heading north along with a lane for the rest of traffic. Southbound Nicholas Street heading towards Highway 417 will be two lanes shared between buses and vehicle traffic. Earlier this week, city councillor and transportation committee chair Keith Egli said people should avoid Nicholas Street if they can. Queen Street is also changing Sunday from a two-way street to a one-way eastbound street heading toward downtown from Bay Street to Metcalfe Street. Queen Street will become a one-way eastbound street from Bay Street to Metcalfe Street. (Andrew Foote/CBC) Crews will be overhauling the street to improve it for the extra foot traffic expected when Lyon and Parliament light rail stations open on Queen Street in 2018. Westbound vehicles will be directed one street south to Albert Street while this construction work is happening. Other one-day events that could affect traffic on Sunday are: Red lines are roads that are changing long-term, while purple lines are one day only. Mobile users tap here to see the map.

Question 1: Should I jailbreak my iPhone again? Question 2: Should I jailbreak my iPhone 4? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Step 1: Identify the core concern in both questions. Both questions revolve around whether or not to jailbreak an iPhone. Step 2: Evaluate the variables in each question. Question 1 merely asks about jailbreaking an iPhone in general, whereas Question 2 specifies an iPhone 4. Step 3: Consider the advantages and disadvantages of jailbreaking. Advantages: - Increased customization options - Access to additional apps not available in the App Store - Potential removal of default apps Disadvantages: - Voiding the warranty - Increased security risks - Possible instability in the system Step 4: Consider the context of the specified iPhone model in Question 2. The iPhone 4 is an older model, which may already be out of warranty and may not receive regular software updates from Apple. Therefore, the main disadvantages of jailbreaking might not be as significant in this case. Step 5: Compare both questions considering their variables and context. While the core concern is the same in both questions, the variables and context differ. Question 1 doesn't specify an iPhone model, and the general advice may not apply to all iPhones. In the case of Question 2, the answer may lean more towards jailbreaking because the disadvantages might be less significant, given that it's an older iPhone model. Conclusion: The answer to these two questions would not be the same due to the different context and variables involved. For Question 1, the answer would depend on various factors such as the specific iPhone model, warranty, and user preferences. For Question 2, given that it's an iPhone 4, jailbreaking may be a more justifiable option, but ultimately depends on your personal preferences and willingness to accept the risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more items thrown away that can be reused happens, how will it affect the inner core is smaller.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"In the context of a red giant transforming into a white dwarf and the perturbation hypothesis, the hypothesis proposes that additional elements thrown away or not reused might affect the inner core's size. However, it is crucial to understand the stages of a red giant's transformation into a white dwarf to determine if this perturbation would affect the process directly or indirectly. The process of a red giant becoming a white dwarf can be summarized into following steps: 1. The red giant's core fuses hydrogen and helium, creating high temperatures and massive amounts of energy. 2. As the hydrogen and helium decrease, the core temperature continues to rise, causing the star to expand. 3. The core eventually becomes comprised mostly of carbon and oxygen. At this point, the temperature is insufficient to initiate carbon fusion. 4. The outer layers of the red giant are released into space due to gravitational forces no longer retaining these layers. 5. Once the outer layers have been ejected, the remaining core, known as a white dwarf, is left behind. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more elements/materials are ejected from the red giant than what is mentioned in the process, it could influence the size of the inner core. Nonetheless, there might not be any direct effect on the transition stages outlined above, since the core temperature and fusion processes determine the evolution of the star. However, there might be indirect effects in the sense that having a slightly smaller core could influence the overall lifespan and properties of the resulting white dwarf. For instance, the cooling rate of the white dwarf or the time it will take to eventually transform into a black dwarf might change.  In summary, the perturbation hypothesis might not have a direct effect on the transformation process of a red giant into a white dwarf, but it could indirectly influence some properties and the lifecycle of the resulting white dwarf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The question proposes a scenario in which muscles are moved in an expanding motion. To analyze the effects of such a perturbation, let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. Electrical signals in the brain still travel through nerves to muscles - no effect on the process of the brain sending signals. 2. Two types of proteins still exist in filaments in the muscles - no effect on the existence of these proteins in filaments. 3. The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - a possible effect due to the proposed expanding motion instead of the regular contraction motion. The manner in which the filaments move might change or be less efficient in this scenario. 4. The motion of the filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract - an effect on this step, as expanding motion opposes the normal contraction motion. The muscle might not be able to contract as efficiently or at all in the expanding motion scenario. 5. Opposing pairs of muscles exist to provide the necessary range of motion - less effect, considering the expanding motion may alter the way these opposing muscle pairs work together, but they would still theoretically have some range of motion.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people.

Most significantly, though, Gerrard revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. He intended to commit to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until November. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard break his silence on his Anfield exit. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed he would have signed a new contract during the summer. Gerrard runs away in celebration after giving Premier League outfit Liverpool the lead against Wimbledon. Steven Gerrard hits the town for his team-mate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday on Tuesday. ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I’d have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. I didn't want my club games to be tailored. 'My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. 'It's all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. 'There's no blame and I'm not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. 'There is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club.'

Spanish full back Jose Enrique poses for a photo with his partner on Tuesday evening. Steven Gerrard (left) wheels away after heading in the opening goal of the game against AFC Wimbledon. Rodgers spoke to Gerrard, who is expected to sign a deal with MLS side LA Galaxy in the near future, in late November and it came as something of a surprise to the player, but once the writing was on the wall the former England captain knew his days at Anfield were numbered. 'I've got to be honest, that chat with Brendan came earlier than I was expecting,' he added. 'It was about a month before that he first mentioned to me about managing my game time. 'We had another chat on the subject recently - 10 days to two weeks ago. It was tough but I understood. It's been very amicable. Everyone knows how much I rate Brendan. Our relationship is very good. 'There hasn't been a cross word between us. Brendan has been fantastic for me. My only regret is that I didn't get to work with him at a younger age. Gerrard looks on as his fine free-kick goes over the wall on its way to securing Liverpool a 2-1 victory.

Gerrard reiterates that he has never wanted to be a squad player, and he knew his playing time would continue to decrease if he stayed at Liverpool. Ultimately, Steven Gerrard's departure from Liverpool came down to a combination of timing and the club's priorities at the time. While he would have preferred to remain with the club, his desire to be a regular contributor led him to seek opportunities elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017.

Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it.

Check if the paint is deteriorating. Article:","output":"Title: How to Figure Out if Your Home's Paint is from 1970 or Earlier Hello, kids! Today, we're going to learn about how to find out if the paint on a house is an old one, particularly from 1970 or earlier. This is important because older paint can sometimes be dangerous if it starts falling apart or isn't taken care of properly. First, let's understand why it's important to know about the age of the paint. Paints that were made before 1978 often had a harmful ingredient called \\"lead.\\" This can be bad for our health if we accidentally eat paint chips or breathe in dust from the paint. So, it's very important to find out if the paint on a house is old. Here are some steps you can follow to learn more about the paint: 1. Talk to the owner of the home: The first thing you can do is chat with the person who owns the home. They might know when the house was painted last. If they don't know, they might have some clues, like old pictures or documents that show the house during different years. These can give you an idea about the age of the paint. 2. Ask the previous owners or neighbors: If the current owner doesn't know, don't worry! You can also try talking to the people who lived in the house before them, or even the neighbors. They might remember what the house looked like when it was painted. 3. Check if the paint is deteriorating: Older paint has a higher chance of coming off or crumbling. You can gently poke at the paint with a wooden stick or your finger to see if it flakes off easily. If it does, once you have checked the age of the paint, you should be extra careful to keep everyone safe. 4. Look for clues in the home: You may find some clues in the paint itself. Older paint may have a chalky or rough texture. If you see any paint that looks bubbled, cracked, or uneven, it might be from before 1970.  Remember to always be careful when dealing with older paint! If you find out that your house has paint from before 1970, it's a good idea to talk to an adult or a professional painter. They can help you figure out the right steps to keep everyone safe and sound! Now, you know how to figure out if your home's paint is from 1970 or earlier.

Information:  - Shanghai Baby is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Chinese author Wei Hui. It was originally published in China in 1999. The English translation was published in 2001.  - Early life and teen years. Born only three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the son of a school teacher, Jia Yanchun (), Jia had an early role model for his later decision to become a writer. Due to a shortage of qualified teachers in Shaanxi at the time, however, Jia's father was often away from home and so he spent much of his early childhood with his mother, Zhou Xiao'e (). With the advent of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Jia Yanchun was accused of being a counter-revolutionary and he spent the next ten years in a labor camp. Three years later, with the closing of all schools in China following the excesses of the Red Guards, Jia was dispatched with his classmates to build reservoirs in the countryside.  - Chinese culture is one of the world's oldest cultures, tracing back to thousands of years ago. The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly between provinces, cities, and even towns as well. Important components of Chinese culture include ceramics, architecture, music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy and religion.  - Mian Mian (born August 28, 1970 in Shanghai) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer. She writes on China's once-taboo topics and she is a promoter of Shanghai's local music. Her publications have earned her the reputation as China's literary wild child.  - Zhou Weihui (born Ningbo, 1973) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer, living and working in Shanghai and New York City. Her novel \\"Shanghai Baby\\" () (1999) was banned in the People's Republic of China as \\"decadent\\". Her latest novel \\"Marrying Buddha\\" () (2005) was censored, modified and published in China under a modified title. She is often associated with Mian Mian, another slightly older member of the \\"New Generation\\".  - The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement that took place in China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country's economy and society to a significant degree.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Shaanxi, formerly romanized as Shensi, is a province of the People's Republic of China.

Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - An intellectual is a person who engages in critical thinking, research, and reflection about the reality of society, and proposes solutions for the normative problems of society, and thus he or she gains authority as a public intellectual. Coming from the world of culture, either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics, either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by producing or by extending an ideology, and by defending a system of values.  - , formerly written Ningpo, is a sub-provincial city in northeast Zhejiang province in China. It comprises the urban districts of Ningbo proper, three satellite cities, and a number of rural counties including islands in Hangzhou Bay and the East China Sea.

Question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Why are the young girls screaming? - The waitress passed out and hit her head. - not enough information - They saw the waitress smoking. - They were waiting on the waitress to take their order.

This positive outcome would undoubtedly instill a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction within Bailey, knowing that his efforts and hard work have paid off. Feeling like a winner implies that Bailey not only achieved success in this specific contest but also experienced a boost in self-confidence and motivation, acknowledging that his abilities and determination led him to victory. Shortly after receiving this news, Bailey's excitement would manifest in various ways, such as sharing the accomplishment with friends and family, planning a celebration to commemorate this achievement, or already thinking about new challenges he could undertake with this newfound confidence. The excitement following a victory often serves as a catalyst for the individual, inspiring them to strive for further successes and personal growth in different areas of their life. Throughout this entire experience, Bailey would not feel like a loser, as the context clearly indicates that he emerged as the victor in the contest. In fact, his winning status would contribute to the myriad of positive emotions he likely experienced. This accomplishment would encourage Bailey to reflect on the challenges and setbacks he overcame during the contest and view them as integral components that contributed to his eventual triumph. In conclusion, Bailey would feel like a winner and excited upon learning from his mother that he had won the contest. His emotions would be dominated by a tremendous sense of achievement, satisfaction, and enthusiasm, propelling him to capitalize on this success by setting new goals and sharing his accomplishment with his loved ones.

Context: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

Step 2: Isolate the variable v To isolate v, we need to get rid of the constant 1386 on the right side of the equation. Subtract 1386 from both sides: 0 - 1386 = 66*v + 1386 - 1386, which simplifies to -1386 = 66*v. Step 3: Solve for v Now we need to get v by itself. Since it's being multiplied by 66, we need to divide by 66 on both sides: -1386 ÷ 66 = 66*v ÷ 66. This simplifies to: -21 = v.

Intellectual Stimulation The person was bored by the remedial math class, which indicates that they were seeking intellectual stimulation. Remedial classes are designed for students who need extra help in certain subjects because they might be struggling or not familiar with the material. These classes typically cover foundational concepts and basic skills in the given subject. In the case of a math class, this could include topics like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as basic arithmetic and number operations. It is understandable that someone might become bored in a remedial class if they already have a solid grasp of the material being covered, or if they have a naturally curious and inquisitive mind. This person likely desired more advanced or complex concepts to be introduced in the class, or perhaps they were hoping for a faster-paced learning environment that would challenge their existing knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Intellectual stimulation refers to the engagement of a person's mind, requiring them to think critically, learn new information, or tackle challenging problems. People who seek intellectual stimulation often enjoy academic or scholarly activities, such as reading books, participating in discussions, engaging in debates, solving puzzles, or exploring new ideas and concepts. In this context, the person wanted to step beyond the basic material covered in the remedial math class and seek out more intellectually stimulating activities or coursework.

Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit.  Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach.  They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden.  There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess.

We find that several signaling pathways, including Ras/protein kinase A, AMP-activated kinase, the high-osmolarity response mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and protein phosphatase 1, regulate activation of Msn2 in distinct ways in response to different stresses. Moreover, we find that bursts of nuclear localization elicit a more robust transcriptional response than does sustained nuclear localization. Using stochastic modeling, we reproduce in silico the responses of Msn2 to different stresses, and demonstrate that bursts of localization arise from noise in the signaling pathways amplified by the small number of Msn2 molecules in the cell. This noise imparts diverse behaviors to genetically identical cells, allowing cell populations to \\"hedge their bets\\" in responding to an uncertain future, and to balance growth and survival in an unpredictable environment.

Please answer the following question: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of new rules requiring smaller engine bodies, resulting in less power being generated by the engine, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate, the steps involved in the process of power generation in an engine are as follows: 1. Fuel mixes with air: The air-fuel mixture is essential for the combustion process. The engine requires an optimal air-fuel ratio for efficient combustion. Reducing the size of the engine body could result in less space for fuel and air to mix properly, which could negatively impact the efficiency of the combustion process. 2. Mix gets inducted into cylinder: The air-fuel mixture is drawn into the engine cylinders during the intake stroke. A smaller engine body could lead to smaller cylinder volumes, limiting the amount of air-fuel mixture that can be inducted into the cylinder, thus impacting overall engine power. 3. Piston compresses the mix: As the piston moves upwards, it compresses the air-fuel mixture, preparing it for combustion. A smaller engine could potentially have smaller pistons or reduced piston movement range, which can affect the compression ratio and impact the engine's power output. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion: The spark plug initiates the combustion process. A smaller engine body could indirectly affect the combustion process due to the reduced amount of air-fuel mixture or a change in cylinder dimensions, which may lead to incomplete combustion and power loss. 5. Combustion gases expand: The expanding combustion gases apply pressure on the piston, forcing it downward during the power stroke. Reduced combustion efficiency in a smaller engine will have a direct impact on the expansion and force applied to the piston, leading to lower power output. 6. Pushes piston during power stroke: As a result of reduced combustion efficiency, the force acting on the piston during the power stroke may be diminished, indirectly affecting the amount of power generated by the engine. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tailpipe: The exhaust valve releases the spent combustion gases. While this step is not directly affected by the smaller engine body, the less efficient combustion process and reduced power output could lead to incomplete expulsion of exhaust gases, affecting overall engine performance and efficiency. In conclusion, the introduction of new rules requiring smaller engine bodies will indirectly impact several steps of the engine's power-generation process, leading to less power being generated by the engine. This perturbation does not directly impact any one specific step but rather indirectly affects multiple steps within the process, leading to reduced overall performance and power output."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Lost natural wonder in New Zealand may be found, say researchers      The eighth natural wonder of the world may have been rediscovered, 131 years after it was buried by a volcanic eruption, New Zealand researchers believe.      In the mid-1800s, the pink and white terraces of Lake Rotomahana in the North Island attracted tourists from around the globe. The terraces – dramatic cascading pools descending into the lake’s temperate waters – were lost in an eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886.      Two researchers think they have pinpointed the location where the terraces may lie preserved 10-15 metres (32-49ft) below the surface, under layers of mud and ash, and said a full archaeological survey was needed to excavate the site.      “They [the terraces] became the greatest tourist attraction in the southern hemisphere and the British empire, and shiploads of tourists made the dangerous visit down from the UK, Europe and America to see them,” said Rex Bunn, one of the researchers. “But they were never surveyed by the government of the time, so there was no record of their latitude or longitude.”      Bunn and Dr Sascha Nolden believe the terraces were not destroyed or pushed to the bottom of the lake, as earlier research suggested, but were buried on the foreshore of the lake.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lake Rotomahana in the North Island of New Zealand. Photograph: Jon Lovette/Getty Images      They used the field diaries of the German-Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, which contain a detailed description of the terraces’ location before the 1886 eruption, to establish their likely resting place.      “Our research relied on the only survey ever made of that part of New Zealand and therefore we are confident the cartography is sound,” Bunn said. “Hochstetter was a very competent cartographer.”      Since the pair’s research paper was published this month in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand, Bunn said he had received daily offers of help to conduct a survey and was in the process of assembling a “team of the willing” to begin exploring the site, once the first funding goal of NZ70,000 (£40,000) was met.      “We want to undertake this work in the public interest. And I have been closely liaising with the ancestral owners of the land, the Tuhourangi Tribal Authority, and they are supportive and delighted with the work,” he said.      Bunn said he believed the terraces may be in reasonable condition, potentially with minimal damage, and could be restored to their former glory once excavated.      This is not the first time researchers have claimed to have discovered the lost terraces. In 2011, scientists using an unmanned submarine said they had found remnants of them on the floor of the lake, buried by silt and debris.      Last year, GNS Science New Zealand said that after five years of research, a team of New Zealand and international scientists had come to the “inescapable conclusion” that most of the terraces had been destroyed by the eruption.      Bunn said he was in discussions with GNS and believed its conclusions were based on 130 years of inaccurate cartographical information. ||||| This story is part of BBC Earth's \\"Best of 2016\\" list, our greatest hits of the year. Browse the full list.      In the early hours of 10 June 1886, Mount Tarawera, a volcano on the North Island of New Zealand, erupted with astonishing force. The explosions may have been heard as far afield as Christchurch, more than 400 miles (640km) to the south-west.      The eruption killed 120 people, most of them Maoris – native New Zealanders – living in small villages in the surrounding countryside. But it is not just because of its high death toll that the Tarawera eruption is firmly lodged in the collective memory of New Zealanders. Most people also remember the eruption because it robbed the island nation of a treasured natural wonder: the Pink and White Terraces of Lake Rotomahana.      The terraces were the two largest formations of silica sinter – a fine-grained version of quartz – ever known to have existed on Earth. They were located on opposite shores of Lake Rotomahana, situated six miles (10km) to the south-west of Mount Tarawera. And they were extraordinarily beautiful.      The terraces are sometimes even described as the eighth wonder of the world. One was a brilliant white colour, while the other, due to an unknown chemical impurity, was tinged a light shade of pink. Either would easily have constituted a geological marvel on its own merits. But to have two such wonders within sight of each other, and in complementary colours, made the Pink and White Terraces greater than the sum of their parts.      Watercolour paintings from the 19th Century – particularly those of Charles Blomfield – offer a sense of their magnificence.      By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished      \\"It's hard to describe to non-New Zealanders what the terraces mean to us,\\" says Cornel de Ronde, a geologist at GNS Science, a state research institute in New Zealand.      Which explains why the events on that cool June morning have become so infamous.      Shortly after 3am, about an hour after Mount Tarawera rumbled to life, the eruption spread to Lake Rotomahana, and a cluster of volcanic craters opened up on the lake floor.      In 1886 Lake Rotomahana was not visible from any of the surrounding villages, meaning most of the locals could only hear the eruption. But by chance, one person, who happened to be spending the night in the countryside seven miles (11km) to the east, had an unobstructed view of Lake Rotomahana.      The Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed      Two days later the man, Henry Burt, told a journalist that during the eruption the lake had resembled \\"a huge boiling cauldron, bubbling [over] in all directions\\".      By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished. The water had literally been blasted into the air, combining with the erupted volcanic ash to form a muddy sludge that buried the surrounding countryside up to 46ft (14m) deep.      The newly-formed volcanic craters that had blown apart the floor of Lake Rotomahana were still belching out mud and rocks two days later, when the first expedition party arrived to survey the damage.      Not only was the lake gone, but so too it seemed were the Pink and White Terraces. They were nowhere to be seen; the area where they had once stood was caked in volcanic mud. And the white chunks of sinter which some people found mixed in with the volcanic debris did not inspire hope.      The shocking state of Lake Rotomahana and its surroundings after the 1886 eruption led New Zealanders to believe that the Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed.      Secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces      In the months after the eruption, Lake Rotomahana grew back. Water from surrounding streams began to flow into in the volcanic craters which had blown apart the old lake, gradually forming a new lake four times deeper and covering an area approximately five times the size of the original.      By the end of 1886, the area where the Pink and White Terraces had once stood was under tens of metres of lake water. It seemed like they had been lost for good.      It would be 128 years before the world learned their true fate.      Between 2011 and 2014, scientists from GNS Science led a series of expeditions to map and study the floor of Lake Rotomahana. The expedition was not related to the Pink and White Terraces directly. The team's goal was to discover how the 1886 eruption had affected the geothermal system that had formed the terraces.      But secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces since that dark day in 1886. In their more optimistic moments, some of the scientists may even have hoped to find physical remains.      \\"I did quietly wonder what we might find in the areas where the terraces had once sat,\\" says de Ronde, who led some of the lake expeditions.      But that was dreaming. In the meantime there was important science to be done.      The team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made      One of the researchers' many aims whilst at Lake Rotomahana was to construct high-resolution images of the lake floor, a task which was carried out by de Ronde and his colleagues from New Zealand and the United States. They hoped that by mapping the lake floor in unprecedented detail, they would somehow be able to discover the fate of the lake's geothermal system.      The team obtained the images using, amongst other gadgets, two high-resolution ‘side-scan' sonar instruments. They strapped these onto a pair of torpedo-shaped AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles), which they then remotely manoeuvred through the lake, travelling 31ft (10m) above its floor, mapping the lake floor as they went.      The team performed the sonar survey in February 2011. In order to cover the almost 3.5 square miles (9 sq km) of lake floor, the researchers directed the AUVs along a series of parallel, linear paths – each of which imaged a long but narrow strip of the lake floor, almost as if mowing a lawn.      By combining many such scans – which totalled approximately 186 miles (300km) of scan lines – the team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made.      The sonar images are not what you would see with your eyes down there (which, thanks to the gloom and sediment, would not be much anyway). Instead, the images were in black and white – the dark areas represented sediment, while the brighter parts generally represented rocky material or gases.      The picture of the lake floor that emerged on the sonar scans was dominated by sediment, as the team had expected. But there were plenty of interesting features on the sonar images too.      The team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop      Some showed what looked like cracks – geological faults – crossing sections of the lake floor. de Ronde thinks these were probably formed during the 1886 eruption.      Elsewhere on the sonar map of the lake floor, the team saw ghostly-looking clouds of bubbles rising from small craters on the lake floor, proof that volcanic gases are still emanating from the floor of Lake Rotomahana today.      De Ronde was used to seeing features like these on sonar scans. He had carried out similar analyses of volcanoes on the seafloor. But on one of the sonar images, taken in the north-western corner of Lake Rotomahana, de Ronde and his team saw something they had never seen before, on a sonar image or on any kind of image.      Jutting above the lake floor, the team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop, stretching for a horizontal distance of around 197ft (60m).      The scientists did not know what they had found. The feature clearly was not a fault: faults are sharply delineated, whereas the mystery outcrop had a misshapen, lumpy appearance.      But it was the location of this strange feature that really grabbed the team's attention. They were in the area of the lake floor where the Pink Terraces had once stood.      With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish      The researchers knew that the lumpy outcrop they had discovered could not possibly be the whole of the Pink Terraces; it was only a fraction of their size. But could it be a fragment? This thought alone was enough to get the scientists' pulses racing.      The team wanted a photograph right away. Sonar was one thing, but to determine whether the feature might actually be a section of the Pink Terraces, they needed to examine it visually.      They had to wait three years. When the researchers first spotted the possible terrace remains in 2011, they had been too caught up with completing the rest of their surveys to deploy their deep-water camera. But when the team returned to Lake Rotomahana for their next round of surveys, in February 2014, they positioned their boat above the possible terrace remains and dropped down the camera.      Most of the photographs the team took showed sediment and not much else. But to be safe, they took thousands. And on two of those photographs, de Ronde and his colleagues found something that definitely was not sediment. It also made them smile.      The photos showed a rounded, rocky-looking outcrop, sloping gently to one side. And the parts that were not draped in sediment had a bright, pale appearance. With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish.      This photographic evidence, coupled with the fitting location of the rocks on the lake floor, was enough to confirm it: de Ronde and his colleagues were looking at a section of the Pink Terraces. They had suddenly resurrected a natural wonder.      But the best was still to come. Buoyed by their re-discovery of the Pink Terraces, the team re-deployed the aquatic camera approximately 0.6 miles (1km) to the north-east: the relative location, in the pre-1886 landscape, of the White Terraces.      Amazingly, these photographs showed much the same thing. In the location where the White Terraces had stood before the 1886 eruption, the camera showed a large lump of pale rock.      If anything, this second outcrop looked even more terrace-like than the first. The whitish rock seemed to have the same vertical, columnar texture that is apparent in pre-eruption photographs of the White Terraces. De Ronde likens its texture to candle wax.      The team had chalked up another discovery, and Lake Rotomahana had suddenly regained pieces of both of its famous terraces. They had been amputated, drowned and buried by over a century of sediment, but somehow, incredibly, they had partially survived the eruption of 1886.      The photographs and sonar images showing the terrace remnants are published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research.      They certainly were just fragments of the terraces – only 10% of the Pink Terraces seem to have survived, and even less of the White Terraces – but that fact almost added to the rarity of the discovery for the researchers.      Technically speaking, the terraces had always been a sidebar to the group's mission – a romantic distraction, but nothing of scientific substance. But in other ways, the terraces meant a great deal to the scientists – and to New Zealanders more generally.      Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived      \\"I suppose it's a bit like Americans finding evidence for a long-lost Grand Canyon,\\" says de Ronde.      At the end of their 2014 expedition, the researchers left Lake Rotomahana for the last time. The group had achieved their scientific goals: they had established that the geothermal system at the lake was still active, and they had produced a bathymetric map of the lake floor that was 400 times sharper than any other.      But they had also helped shed new light on the events of 10 June 1886. From his viewpoint seven miles away, Henry Burt – the only eyewitness – probably saw relatively little. The volumes of ash already coming from Mount Tarawera, and the volcanic mud that was about to issue from Lake Rotomahana itself, would soon have blocked his view.      But the new discoveries made at Lake Rotomahana provide a second witness to what happened that night. The fact that only fragments of the Pink and White terraces remain today strongly suggests that the majority of these old wonders were indeed destroyed by the eruption, probably soon after it began.      But Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived the catastrophe he witnessed.      Follow BBC Earth on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Programs that follow a knowledge-based approach typically have a higher probability of successful cost and schedule outcomes. Does it follow that \\"Although the knowledge-based approach is more successful, it requires more effort and funding to implement.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the statement \\"Although the knowledge-based approach is more successful, it requires more effort and funding to implement.\\" follows from the given information, let me analyze it step-by-step: 1. First, I'll reiterate the given information: \\"Programs that follow a knowledge-based approach typically have a higher probability of successful cost and schedule outcomes.\\" 2. Next, I need to assess if a knowledge-based approach, which leads to better cost and schedule outcomes, would necessarily require more effort and funding. 3. A knowledge-based approach, by definition, relies on a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and incorporates the expertise and experience of professionals. This involves gathering, organizing, and applying information effectively. 4. Comparing this to non-knowledge-based approaches, which might not rely on the same level of expertise, it seems reasonable to assume that the development and utilization of a knowledge-based system could involve higher levels of effort. 5. However, it is not necessarily true that a knowledge-based approach will always require more funding. The additional effort put into the process initially might lead to a more efficient and well-organized system, potentially reducing costs in the long run. Additional funding may be needed to support expert opinions, data acquisition, and system development. But this can vary depending on the nature of the project, and in some cases, it may even cost less due to reduced errors, rework, and improved decision-making. Conclusion: It is reasonable to infer that a knowledge-based approach would likely require more effort compared to non-knowledge-based approaches. However, it depends on the specific context and project whether the knowledge-based approach requires more funding or not. Therefore, the statement that a knowledge-based approach requires more effort and funding to implement does not necessarily follow from the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering.  - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Volcanic gases include a variety of substances given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) volcanoes. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action.  - A planetary body or planetary object is any secondary body in the Solar System that is geologically differentiated or in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus has a planet-like geology: a planet, dwarf planet, or the larger moons and asteroids.  - In hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline. A large bay may be called a \\"gulf\\", a \\"sea\\", a \\"sound\\", or a \\"bight\\". A \\"cove\\" is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A \\"fjord\\" is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2.  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) .  - Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) is the vertical and horizontal dimension of the land surface. When relief is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. The Latin Word \\"Terra (The root word of terrain),\\" is \\"Earth.\\"  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Volcanic rock (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of Precambrian shield geology, the term \\"volcanic\\" is often applied to what are strictly metavolcanic rocks.  - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes.  - A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine. This type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center, which is responsible for seafloor spreading. The production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading; this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts. The buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust, and emerges as lava, creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary.  - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - Topography is the study of the shape and features of the surface of the Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons, and asteroids. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps).     After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'mountain' with the relationship of 'part of'.

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

It explains that the citizens were restrained or imprisoned, most likely as a preventative measure or a form of punishment. The phrase \\"by the royal guard\\" is a prepositional phrase that indicates who performed the action of putting the citizens in chains. It gives more information about who is responsible for restraining the citizens. Finally, the clause \\"since they have been accused of breaking the law\\" explains the reason behind the action of restraining the citizens. Here, \\"they\\" is used as a pronoun to replace the previously mentioned subject \\"some citizens of the kingdom.\\" So, the sentence is describing a situation where certain citizens in a kingdom were restrained by the royal guard due to accusations of breaking the law.

I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well.  My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda. Not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message. A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? Choices: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"This review can be described as leaning towards a positive sentiment. Although the reviewer points out the one-sidedness of both Winter Soldier and The Ground Truth, they highlight the effective presentation of the films in illustrating the impact of false pretenses and inadequate training of soldiers on conflicts like the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. They mention the connection between the two films, effectively driving their point home about the similarities and the repeating pattern of events in history. Additionally, the reviewer acknowledges the importance of the message shown in both films, despite expressing a concern that the one-sided nature could lead some to dismiss the films as mere propaganda. Their suggestion for a more balanced point of view to reach a broader audience further demonstrates that they appreciate the overall message of the films and wish for its expansion to a wider group of people. In conclusion, the sentiment of the review carries a positive tune, with the reviewer praising the effectiveness of both films in showcasing the consequences of war and inadequate training. However, they express a desire for a more balanced perspective to strengthen its credibility and impact on a larger audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? from the following article ?  The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost.  However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network.  Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas.  There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold. In five years, 250 thousand more cars are circulating in Caracas on...

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live executives feared Michael Jackson would sabotage his comeback concerts five days before his death, the company's CEO testified Thursday. Randy Phillips refused to advance money to help Jackson pay his staff because he believed the singer was \\"in an anticipatory breach\\" of his contract because he had missed rehearsals, he testified. Phillips testified in the sixth week of the trial to decide whether the concert promoter is liable in Jackson's death for the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children contends that Phillips and other AEG Live executives pressured Jackson to attend rehearsals despite his deteriorating health and ignored red flags that should have warned them about the dangers posed by Murray.  OPTIONS: - AEG Live lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - CNN lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Conrad Murray lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Jackson lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Los Angeles lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Michael Jackson lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Murray lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Phillips lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Randy Phillips lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia.","output":"- AEG Live lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. This is the correct answer because AEG Live is the concert promoter being accused of being liable in Jackson's death. Their lawyers would be the ones claiming that the executives had no knowledge of Murray's actions. The other options are wrong because they are not the ones responsible for the trial or accused of negligence: - CNN lawyers, Los Angeles lawyers, and Phillips lawyers are not involved in the lawsuit regarding Jackson's death. - Conrad Murray lawyers and Murray lawyers would not be claiming innocence for AEG Live executives, as Murray was already convicted of involuntary manslaughter. - Jackson lawyers and Michael Jackson lawyers are the ones accusing AEG Live of negligence, so they would not be arguing that AEG Live executives had no way of knowing about Murray's actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The island's previous Independent-led administration lodged an appeal after the High Court ruled in favour of a father who took his child on holiday. The Supreme Court challenge to that ruling is due to be heard next week. Conservative Chris Whitehouse said the case should have been dropped after the initial magistrates' hearing in 2015. Mr Whitehouse, who became executive member for children's services after the Conservatives took control of the council last week, said: \\"I have not changed my position on the school absences case, it should have been dropped immediately after the magistrates' hearing. \\"I am limited in what I can say formally about this case because of a legal agreement entered into by my predecessor on behalf of the council. \\"I intend to take further independent legal advice and may issue a purely personal statement in due course.\\" The Supreme Court hearing, due to be heard on Tuesday 31 January, follows months of legal wrangling over the case of Jonathan Platt, who was fined Â£120 after taking his daughter to Florida. When magistrates concluded Mr Platt had no case to answer because his daughter had attended school regularly, Isle of Wight Council appealed to the High Court, which also ruled in favour of Mr Platt. The latest challenge was launched by the then Independent-led council on the request of Schools Minister Nick Gibb, with a commitment from the Department for Education (DfE) to meet the council's costs. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\"Our position remains that children should not be taken out of school without good reason. \\"That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence. \\"The evidence shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Supreme Court is due to hear a challenge to a High Court ruling in favor of a father who took his child on holiday during school term.

Article: London police are well known in the world. Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement   is to meet changing  conditions and provide excellent police service  .

There's a bitter battle being fought on the High Street between retail titans Marks & Spencer and John Lewis. What are they fighting over? Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it. Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis's spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S's, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable. Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict... John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140. M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55. Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection. Yes, they're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it.  You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work.  And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night. These trousers would be  flattering whatever your size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you'd sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection.  I'm not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version. These are creased even on the hanger and they're cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women.  One good thing is that they're properly lined, so at least your knickers won't show through the white fabric. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59. M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59. Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success.  The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it's limp on the hanger, so it's going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap. On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They've designed them with women's curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S's strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive.  The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they're almost the same price. However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there's too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side? WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers. John Lewis: Dress, £89. M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35. The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape.  The nautical look isn't overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman. Nautical stripes aren't a particular trend for 2014, but they're a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look well. Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It's too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy.  The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the seams.  Yes, it's cheap, but I just can't see many people looking good in it. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com. M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com. At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them on.  Though a fitted, white dress isn't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible. The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette.  Then there's the M&S version, which I really don't like.  Yes, they've picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps.  Then there's that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered. I'm surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20.  I can't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it.  And the final blow is that it's more than double the price of John Lewis's version. My advice is to steer clear. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59. M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75. The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line. It's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I'd say these will be on the sale rail before long. I'm also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top. I don't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store's normal range, there's often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una. The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look. WINNER: M&S.

Envoy Brahimi Meets President Assad in Syria BEIRUT, Lebanon — The new United Nations peace envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, said after a meeting with President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday that the civil war held consequences for “the region, and the whole world,” while acknowledging that he had not yet formulated a plan to address the escalating violence. “The crisis is very serious,” Mr. Brahimi said, adding that it was “becoming worse by the day.” That grim assessment came on the third day of Mr. Brahimi’s visit to Syria, where he said he had met opposition activists, government officials and diplomats representing Russia and China, countries that have offered support for President Assad’s embattled government. Mr. Brahimi, a seasoned diplomat from Algeria, took the job of special envoy representing the United Nations and the Arab League after Kofi Annan, a former United Nations secretary general, resigned last month. In announcing his resignation, Mr. Annan insisted there could be no solution unless Mr. Assad stepped down, and blamed the intransigence of both the Syrian government and its opponents for the continuing bloodshed. In the weeks since Mr. Annan resigned, there has been no lessening of the violence, with the Syrian government relying more and more on air power to vanquish its enemies as rebel militias continue to search for weapons to counter the military’s power. On Friday, Pope Benedict XVI added his voice to those warning of the dangers posed by weapons flowing into Syria, saying that the import of arms, by the government and the rebels, must stop. At a news conference on Saturday after his meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Brahimi said he was “continuing the work” that Mr. Annan had started, and declined to say how his approach would differ. “It is not a secret that the gap between the parties is very wide,” he said, adding that Mr. Assad was “more aware than me of the scope and the seriousness of the crisis.” “The common ground does exist,” Mr. Brahimi said. “These are Syrians, they love their country and want peace for their country.” Since Mr. Brahimi’s arrival on Thursday, witnesses have reported intense fighting in two neighborhoods south of Damascus, the capital, Hajar al-Aswad and Qadam. Protesters could be seen marching in both neighborhoods on Friday, escorted by armed rebels. In Qadam, government security forces in sport utility vehicles tried to disrupt the march, leading to clashes. A 30-year-old protester in Qadam, who gave only his first name, Ibrahim, took a dim view of Mr. Brahimi’s mission. “The U.N. envoys will do nothing, because they have no power,” he said. “They will spend their time in meaningless meetings with regime officials, or opposition figures who have no presence on the ground.” On Saturday, at least three people were killed in Hajar al-Aswad during hours of intense shelling by the government, activists in Damascus said. Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"United Nations peace envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, meets with President Bashar al-Assad and acknowledges the severity of the ongoing civil war, stating that it holds consequences for the region and the whole world; however, he has not yet formulated a plan to address the escalating violence.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who does Lowell speak to constantly, as if they are children? , can you please find it?   It is implied that, in the future, all plant life on Earth has become extinct. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of  enormous, greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to a large spaceship named \\"Valley Forge\\", forming part of a fleet of American Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn.  Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen. Enlisting the aid of the ship's three \\"drones\\" (service robots), Huey, Dewey and Louie (named after Donald Duck's nephews), Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 (Louie) is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell and the surviving drones, Huey and Dewey, set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children. Answer:","output":"Lowell speaks constantly to the ship's three \\"drones\\" - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as if they are children. These service robots assist him in preserving the plants and animals on the Valley Forge spaceship. After rebelling against the crew's orders to destroy the domes, Lowell enlists the help of the drones and reprograms them to take care of the forest, perform surgery on his leg, and even play poker with him. By treating the drones like children, Lowell forms a bond with them and engages in conversation as he continues his mission to protect and preserve the remaining plant life for the reforestation of Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

This is because when someone takes on the responsibility of planning and executing a fun and educational outing for children, it demonstrates their consideration towards the well-being and happiness of the younger individuals involved. By immersing the children in the enriching and engaging environment that a museum provides, Kendall displayed a genuine interest in their growth and learning, which is an act of kindness. Additionally, in making sure that the children enjoyed themselves, Kendall would derive a sense of satisfaction and pleasure from witnessing their joy and fascination. This can lead to the person feeling a strong sense of empathy and connection with the children they are caring for. These positive emotions not only foster an atmosphere of warmth and affection but also contribute to the formation of healthy bonds between the caregiver and the children. Furthermore, by exposing the children to a variety of exhibits and artifacts, Kendall would have enabled them to acquire new knowledge and broaden their horizons. This opportunity for intellectual expansion might spark a sense of wonder and curiosity in the kids and inspire them to explore other areas of interest. In turn, Kendall would feel satisfied and content in knowing that they played an important part in nurturing the children's desire for continuous learning. In summary, after successfully planning a fun and engaging museum visit for the kids, Kendall would feel kind for providing a memorable experience that aligns with their best interests.

Question: \\"What effect does boosting bass and cutting treble have on the original signal?\\"  Context: \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\"  Answer:","output":"Boosting bass and cutting treble in the playback equipment has a significant effect on the original signal, mainly in terms of tonal balance restoration and noise reduction. To understand this effect, it is essential to consider the reasons behind the equalization techniques used during the recording and playback processes. During the early days of recorded music, limitations in mastering and manufacturing imposed the need for reducing both high and low frequencies from the original recorded signals. In the case of low frequencies, the stylus had to make larger movements from side to side, demanding wider grooves and taking up more space on the record. This limited the playing time of the record. On the other hand, high frequencies presented the issue of hiss, pops, and ticks, which affected the overall listening experience. To combat these limitations, equalization techniques were employed. During the recording process, the amplitude of low frequencies was reduced to minimize the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies was increased. This allowed more music to be fit onto the record without significantly compromising the sound quality. However, this standard equalization alone was not enough to provide an optimal sound reproduction, as the original tonal balance was altered. The playback equipment was designed to address this issue by boosting bass and cutting treble to restore the original tonal balance of the music. Boosting bass compensates for the reduced amplitude of low frequencies that occurred during the recording process, allowing for a fuller and more accurate reproduction of the original signal's low-end sounds. Cutting treble, on the other hand, has a two-fold effect: it not only restores the original amplitude of high frequencies but also reduces the high-frequency noise resulting from the limitations in the recording technology. By boosting bass and cutting treble, the playback equipment effectively negates the equalization applied during the recording process, ultimately restoring the original signal's tonal balance, while also minimizing noise and other audio artifacts. Consequently, this leads to an improved listening experience and a more accurate representation of the original music within the limitations of the recording technology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Ofstandarderogforsendelseridentifikasjonerguideallutilisatorsgeneratedcontentaswellastheresponsesofrelatedinstitutions.","output":"The task requires me to form a coherent and grammatically correct sentence with the given list of characters. Step 1: Identify the separate words hidden in the string of characters. The block of text seems to be made up of a series of connected words, which need to be isolated for the sentence formation. Here's how I would break down the string: Of, standard, erog, for, sendelser, identifikasjon, er, guide, all, utilisator, s, generated, content, as, well, as, the, responses, of, related, institutions. Step 2: Determine the actual words and their equivalents in English. Some of these words aren't recognized in English and seem to be Norwegian. Using a translator, \\"erog\\" can be translated to \\"and\\" and \\"sendelser\\" to \\"transmissions\\". The word \\"identifikasjon\\" is identifiable as \\"identification\\". The phrase \\"standard erog for\\" seems to not make sense, so I'll take the liberty of correcting it to \\"standard for\\". Step 3: Arrange the words into a sentence. Using the separated and translated words, I'll form a sentence that is as logical and grammatically correct as possible. Here's what I get: \\"A standard for transmissions, the guide of identification includes all user-generated content, as well as the responses of related institutions.\\" Step 4: Justify the sentence arrangement. Each part of the sentence has a specific role. \\"A standard for transmissions\\" is the subject, \\"the guide of identification\\" is an object clause adding detail to the subject. \\"Includes all user-generated content\\" is the first part of the predicate, explaining what the guide of identification does. The last part of the sentence \\"as well as the responses of related institutions\\" is a coordinate clause that details what else is included.

I will provide a more detailed and specific answer. The mammalian, and more specifically, human colon is home to a vast and diverse community of bacteria, collectively referred to as gut microbiota. These microbial communities play a vital role in nutrient acquisition, regulation of host metabolism, shaping immune responses, and providing protection against pathogens. The most predominant species belong typically to two primary bacterial phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The Firmicutes comprise several genera, including but not limited to, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. The Bacteroidetes phylum contains notably Bacteroides and Prevotella. Another significant component of this microbiota belongs to the Actinobacteria phylum, particularly the Bifidobacterium genus, reputed for their probiotic properties.  A lesser but significant proportion of the microbiota falls under the Proteobacteria phylum (including Escherichia and Helicobacter), as well as the Verrucomicrobia phylum, with Akkermansia muciniphila being a common representative species. Some yeasts and fungi (e.g., Saccharomyces and Candida species) also colonize the colon, albeit in much smaller quantities compared to bacteria.  These communities are not static; they are affected by various factors such as diet, antibiotic usage, the host's immune state, and environmental factors. Alterations to the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can lead to various health conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neuropsychiatric disorders.  In essence, the mammalian colon is a complex and dynamic ecosystem teeming with bacteria, fungus and yeasts, predominantly from the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Cultivating a balanced and diverse gut microbiota is integral to maintaining overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A member of the president’s Secret Service protective detail, who was being investigated for having an unreported romantic relationship with a foreign national, was found dead Saturday in an apparent suicide, according to law enforcement sources.      The official cause of Rafael Prieto’s death is still pending.      Text Size -      +      reset      The investigation had led to the suspension of his access to Secret Service facilities, according to sources familiar with the case.      The Secret Service does not believe that Prieto passed any sensitive or classified information to the Mexican woman, according to a senior law enforcement official. Instead, Prieto was in the midst of an “administrative process” related to his ongoing relationship, the source said.      A well-liked veteran of the agency, Prieto may have violated security policy by not disclosing his close and continuing contact with the Mexican woman to his bosses, sources familiar with the probe said.      There has been a crackdown on such relationships in the wake of the Secret Service prostitution scandal in Colombia earlier this year and ensuing reports of similar behavior in other places around the world over the course of many years.      If found guilty of violating Secret Service disclosure policy, Prieto could have faced sanctions including dismissal. In the past, the alleged affair might have garnered a slap on the wrist, according to the law enforcement source. But the prostitution scandal has heightened sensitivity to unauthorized contact with foreign nationals not only at the Secret Service but at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the men and women who protect the president.      “Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication and friendships,” Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said. “The Secret Service is mourning the loss of a valued colleague.”      Donovan declined to discuss the circumstances of Prieto’s death or the details of the administrative process that led to Prieto’s suspension.      According to a 1993 New York Times wedding announcement, Prieto was married to producer and consultant Ruth Pomerance. He hosted her for a tour of the West Wing on Oct. 1, 2011, according to visitor logs.      Prieto had split time between Washington and the couple's home in New York. But they had become estranged, according to a law enforcement official.      Prieto was also a member of former President Bill Clinton's protective team in New York. ||||| For nearly six years, a senior Secret Service agent kept his extramarital affair with a Mexican woman a secret from the agency responsible for protecting the president.      But in the wake of an embarrassing prostitution scandal involving 13 agents and officers, Rafael Prieto's secret was revealed by a fellow employee amid concerns the Secret Service wasn't enforcing its rules consistently. With an internal investigation ongoing, Prieto apparently committed suicide last week, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.      Prieto, a married father assigned to the security detail for President Barack Obama, admitted the years-long relationship with a woman from Mexico to U.S. investigators when confronted. Before his death, he was the subject of an investigation focused on whether he violated agency rules that require disclosing relationships with foreigners, those familiar with the matter said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Prieto's death or the investigation.      Secret Service rules require that employees with a security clearance notify the agency about any relationship with a foreign citizen to ensure that the person is not a risk to national security. There is no evidence that Prieto's relationship posed any security threat. Failing to disclose such a relationship would be not be a crime, but a violation of the agency's administrative rules.      Prieto was serving on the protective detail for Obama, though he was not on duty at the time of his death. As recently as 2009, he was identified as the resident agent in charge at the Secret Service's office in White Plains, N.Y. He had worked for the Secret Service for 22 years. He was 47, according to public records.      Prieto's apparent cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. He was found in his car with the engine running. His death was being investigated by Metropolitan Police in Washington and the medical examiner's office.      \\"Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication and friendships,\\" agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said in a statement. \\"The Secret Service is mourning the loss of a valued colleague.\\"      The Secret Service protects the lives of the president, vice president and their families, and also investigates counterfeiting, bank fraud, computer hacking and other financial crimes.      The behavior of Secret Service agents and officers has come under scrutiny since 13 employees were implicated in a prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, in April.      Those employees were in the Caribbean resort city in advance of Obama's arrival for a South American summit. After a night of heavy partying in some of Cartagena's bars and clubs, the employees brought women, including prostitutes, back to the where they were staying. The incident became public after one agent refused to pay a prostitute and argued with her in a hotel hallway. Prieto was never in Colombia during the scandal.      Eight of those Secret Service employees have been forced out of the agency, three were cleared of serious misconduct and at least two are fighting to get their jobs back.      The scandal prompted Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan to issue a new code of conduct that barred employees from drinking within 10 hours of the start of a shift or bringing foreigners to their hotel rooms. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Rafael Prieto, a member of the President's Secret Service protective detail, was found dead in an apparent suicide amid an investigation into his undisclosed romantic relationship with a foreign national. Prieto's access to Secret Service facilities had been suspended, and he was undergoing an administrative process related to the ongoing relationship.

Your exposition comes at the beginning of the story. This is where you explain who the main character is and what he or she is doing at the beginning of the story. Exposition should be brief and grab the reader's attention.  A story's rising action is the series of conflicts that move the story forward. No story can exist without a problem that needs resolving. In a sad story, there should be an element of tragedy to that problem. For example, maybe your main character is caring for her sick dog. The rising action could include her taking the dog to the vet, finding out the sickness is worse than she thought, and struggling with the setbacks and challenges of her dog's medical needs. Once you've figured out basic story structure, write a short outline for your story. Write out how your story will begin, what rising action you'll include, the climax, and how the story is resolved.  An outline can be brief. It's not necessary to use full sentences in an outline. You just need to have some sense of the basic events that will occur. You can separate your outline into the five elements of story structure: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution. An outline should use numbers and letters for structure. Big headings, like \\"exposition,\\" can be marked with a roman numeral. You can use letters or regular numbers to elaborate on aspects of that heading. For example, \\"I. Exposition, a. introduce Susan.\\" To help you see how to write an outline, let's return to this article's example. You could begin the outline with something like this: \\"Exposition, a. Introduce Ada, crying in art class, b. Sad to be reminded of her father's cancer, c. Returns home alone (her mother is at work) to help care for her ailing dog.\\" Summary:","output":"To write sad stories, begin by seeking inspiration and understanding what makes you sad. Free write on the topic for about 10 minutes, discussing situations that make you sad and your personal experiences with sadness. Read more sad stories to learn from other writers and observe their story structures and characters. Pay attention to opening lines and how stories begin. Familiarize yourself with basic story structure, including exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Write a brief outline for your story, separating it into the five elements of story structure and using numbers and letters for organization. By knowing story structure and gathering inspiration from personal experiences and other stories, you can effectively write a sad story."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Hall of Fame track coach resigns after admitting affair with athlete Bev Kearney was the first African-American coach to win an NCAA national team championship in Division I track and field. (CNN) -- Hall of Fame women's track and field coach Bev Kearney, whose story of recovery from a paralyzing auto accident inspired people around the country, has resigned due to an \\"intimate consensual relationship\\" with a University of Texas athlete in 2002, the school announced Saturday night. The head of the university's legal affairs department said in a written statement that Kearney was a good person who was important to the school. \\"However, she made this terrible mistake and used unacceptably poor judgment in having this relationship,\\" Patti Ohlendorf said. The relationship began 10 1/2 years ago and ended \\"at least about eight years ago,\\" the statement said. Neither the university nor Kearney, who first told the Austin American-Statesman of her decision to step down, identified the athlete. \\"You destroy yourself. You start questioning how could you make such a judgment,\\" Kearney told the newspaper. \\"How could you make such an error after all the years? You can get consumed (by it).\\" A CNN story in August profiled the coach, who learned to walk again after she was injured in a December 26, 2002, accident that killed two of her friends. Thrown more than 50 feet from an SUV, she suffered extensive spinal injuries that left her partially paralyzed. Kearney said she never doubted her ability to walk again and continued to lead her team from her hospital bed. \\"When they told me I was paralyzed, it went in one ear and out the next ... because I had to get up and coach,\\" she said. Coach overcomes homelessness, paralysis and inspires others Track practices were recorded and then played for Kearney on a VCR in her hospital room. \\"Because I was an intuitive coach ... whatever it is you need to do, I can describe it in a way that you internalize it and you feel it without me having to demonstrate it,\\" she said. She also started a foundation that connects young people with mentors. \\"If I can expose you to the best ... it has a great chance of inspiring you to be the best,\\" Kearney explained. Kearney's teams at Texas won six national championships, the most recent in 2006. She also led the University of Florida Gators to a title in 1992. She was inducted into the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2007. \\"(My athletes) would say that I'm tough. That I believe in being the best you can be at all times,\\" she told CNN. \\"I am going to demand their best, and I am relentless at it.\\" Kearney, 55, told the American-Statesman that she might have to sell her home and some of her personal possessions to help support the daughter she adopted after the girl's mother was killed in the 2002 accident. The paper said her attorney, Derek A. Howard, issued a statement, which said in part: \\"We believe that Ms. Kearney has been subjected to a double standard and has received far harsher punishment than that being given to her male counterparts who have engaged in similar conduct. ... It is a shame that this remarkably talented female African-American coach, who has devoted her life to helping others, is being bullied and scapegoated by the University of Texas.\\" Ohlendorf denied Sunday that gender played a role in the university's review and said she knows of no other \\"UT head coach who has entered into such a relationship with a student-athlete on his or her team.\\" Kearney was the first African-American coach to win an NCAA national team championship in Division I track and field, and she was the first African-American to serve as a head coach at Texas. Howard said Sunday that Kearney was given until Monday at noon to resign or she would be fired. He said the relationship wasn't specifically against school policy, but the rules require someone in a supervisory role to report such a relationship. \\"It's not a terminable offense,\\" he said. \\"She was a perfect coach before and prior to the relationship. She had a pristine record. Why anyone would think she is not a suitable coach is mind-boggling to me.\\" Ohlendorf called such a relationship \\"unprofessional and unacceptable.\\" \\"We told Coach Kearney and Mr. Howard that such a relationship crosses the line of trust placed in the head coach for all aspects of the athletic program and the best interests of the student-athletes in the program,\\" she said in an e-mail to CNN Sunday night. Ohlendorf said the school is not naming the student, citing privacy laws. \\"We respect her privacy and appreciate her cooperation during our review,\\" Ohlendorf said. The ex-student reported the former relationship to the school in late October, she said, leading to Kearney being placed on leave in November. The school said the athlete was an adult when the relationship took place and it had no information that Kearney had any other similar relationships.

''  - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - The Charterhouse of Parma is a novel by Stendhal published in 1839. Telling the story of an Italian nobleman in the Napoleonic era and later, it was admired by Balzac, Tolstoy, André Gide and Henry James. The novel has been adapted for opera, film and television.  - Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (2 April 1840  29 September 1902) was a French novelist, playwright, journalist, the best-known practitioner of the literary school of naturalism, and an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline \\"J'accuse\\". Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902.  - Le Rouge et le Noir (French for The Red and the Black) is a historical psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830. It chronicles the attempts of a provincial young man to rise socially beyond his modest upbringing through a combination of talent, hard work, deception, and hypocrisy. He ultimately allows his passions to betray him.  - Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (May 3, 1893  July 17, 1975) was a Georgian writer and public figure, who, along with Mikheil Javakhishvili, is considered to be one of the most influential Georgian novelists of the 20th century. Educated and first published in Germany, he married Western European influences to purely Georgian thematic to produce his best works, such as \\"The Right Hand of the Grand Master\\" and \\"David the Builder\\". Hostile to the Soviet rule, he was, nevertheless, one of the few leading Georgian writers to have survived the Stalin-era repressions, including his exile to a White Sea island and several arrests. His works are noted for their character portrayals of great psychological insight. Another major feature of Gamsakhurdia's writings is a new subtlety he infused into Georgian diction, imitating an archaic language to create a sense of classicism.  - Mikheil Javakhishvili (birth surname: Adamashvili ) (8 November 1880  30 September 1937) was a Georgian novelist who is regarded as one of the top twentieth-century Georgian writers.

In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level.\\"  - Alfred Dreyfus (9 October 1859  12 July 1935) was a French Jewish artillery officer whose trial and conviction in 1894 on charges of treason became one of the most tense political dramas in modern French history with a wide echo in all Europe. Known today as the Dreyfus affair, the incident eventually ended with Dreyfus' complete exoneration.  - Marie-Henri Beyle (23 January 1783  23 March 1842), better known by his pen name Stendhal (or ; in English , , or ), was a 19th-century French writer. Best known for the novels \\"Le Rouge et le Noir\\" (\\"The Red and the Black\\", 1830) and \\"La Chartreuse de Parme\\" (\\"The Charterhouse of Parma\\", 1839), he is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the earliest and foremost practitioners of realism.  - Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It dates back to the foundation of London Hospital Medical College in 1785. Queen Mary College, named after Mary of Teck, was admitted to the University of London in 1915 and in 1989 merged with Westfield College to form Queen Mary and Westfield College.

The practical difficulties can be illustrated by the fact that the two most accurate methods, the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method, do not appear to agree with one another. The most likely reason is that the measurement uncertainty for one (or both) of the methods has been estimated too low – it is (or they are) not as precise as is currently believed – but for the time being there is no indication which method is at fault. Question: Why does this difficulty occur?","output":"The difficulty in determining the Planck constant (h) stems from a combination of both practical and theoretical challenges that come into play when trying to measure or calculate this fundamental quantity. To begin with, let's discuss the practical difficulties. The Planck constant, a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, has the dimensions of energy multiplied by time. It is an essential element in equations such as the famous E=hf, where E is energy, f is frequency, and h is the Planck constant. Since it's at the core of quantum mechanical phenomena, precise measurement of h becomes crucial for all sorts of scientific research and technological applications. At present, the two most accurate methods for measuring h are the watt balance technique and the X-ray crystal density method. Even though both methods are considered highly accurate, they do not agree with one another. This disagreement indicates that there might be some inaccuracies or errors in one (or both) of the methods. The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the measurement uncertainty for one or both of these methods has been underestimated, meaning that they are not as precise as is currently believed. However, it is not yet clear which of the two methods is at fault, adding to the overall difficulty of establishing a more refined value for the Planck constant. Now let's examine the theoretical difficulties involved in determining h. The very nature of quantum mechanics poses challenges for measurements at this scale. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic, with uncertainties inherent in its very principles. One such principle, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, illustrates that there are unavoidable limits in simultaneous measurements of certain pairs of quantities (e.g., position and momentum or energy and time). Measuring these quantities with high precision becomes increasingly difficult at the quantum level due to this inherent uncertainty. Another challenge comes from the definition and realization of the units of measurement involved in determining h, like mass, time, and length. The International System of Units (SI) forms the basis for a majority of scientific measurements and has undergone revisions to improve its accuracy and reliability. In 2019, the definition of the kilogram – a key unit relevant to the Planck constant – was redefined in terms of fundamental constants, including h, leading to a more stable and accurate definition. However, this redefinition has also generated additional difficulties in accurate determination and interconversion of the units. In conclusion, the difficulty in determining the Planck constant arises from a combination of practical and theoretical factors. The disagreement between the two most accurate methods – the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method – suggests that one or both might have underestimated measurement uncertainties. On the theoretical side, the very nature of quantum mechanics introduces uncertainties, while the definition and realization of the units of measurement involved in determining h present additional challenges. Overcoming these difficulties and establishing a more accurate value for the Planck constant will help improve the precision of other scientific and technological applications that rely on this fundamental constant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He takes a job as a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the city's boroughs. He also frequents the porn theaters on 42nd Street and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms, such as \\"You're only as healthy as you feel.\\" Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine.

Derek Mackay has put back publication of his first budget until after the UK government's Autumn statement. Convener Bruce Crawford expressed \\"concern\\" at the amount of time MSPs will have to scrutinise budget plans. A \\"fundamental\\" review of the Scottish budget process is to be held in light of Holyrood's new fiscal powers. The Scottish draft budget is traditionally published in September, but new finance secretary Mr Mackay has proposed delaying his until December - leaving much less time for MSPs to study the details before voting on it in February. He said uncertainty caused by the UK's vote to leave the EU, coupled with Holyrood's new financial powers, meant he would need to see what moves new Chancellor Philip Hammond makes in his statement on 23 November. Mr Crawford, an SNP MSP and former cabinet minister, acknowledged the government faces \\"a significant challenge\\" in putting the budget together, but said his committee \\"remains concerned at the amount of time which will be available for parliamentary scrutiny\\". And in a letter to the finance secretary, he said it was \\"unacceptable\\" that Mr Mackay was not prepared to give the committee any scenario planning information in advance of the draft budget being published. He added: \\"While the committee recognises that there is a need to maintain some flexibility in the timing of the budget process, there also needs to be a recognition that sufficient time is ordinarily allowed for robust parliamentary scrutiny.\\" Mr Crawford has now lodged a parliamentary motion calling for MSPs to debate the timetable, meaning members would get to vote on it - with no guarantee the minority government would win. Mr Mackay defended the delay when questioned by the committee earlier in September. He said: \\"Publishing an inaccurate budget would be the wrong thing to do. The starting position is about to change, and having such intense scrutiny on a budget that would be subject to so much change because of the variables would be the wrong approach.\\" The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the move, with committee member Murdo Fraser saying it was \\"essential\\" that parliament had \\"sufficient time to scrutinise the budget\\". He added: \\"Under the SNP plans, this would have left just two weeks for the plans to be analysed, when usually there are two months for that. \\"The SNP is now a minority government and can't simply force through what it wants. Today, Derek Mackay is learning that very lesson.\\" Scottish Labour also said it would be \\"completely unacceptable\\" for the government to delay all scrutiny until December. MSP James Kelly said: \\"Derek Mackay has been unwilling to give MSPs any ballpark numbers. Given how vital this budget will be, that simply isn't good enough. \\"The SNP have form for trying to dodge parliamentary scrutiny, they cannot repeat those tricks when it comes to the funding for Scotland's public services.\\" A Scottish government spokeswoman welcomed the committee's recognition that the Brexit vote and new powers \\"necessitates a later publication\\" of the budget. She added that a number of committees \\"have already adapted their approach to budget scrutiny\\", and pointed to the ongoing review of the budget process. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about Derek Mackay, a finance secretary in Scotland, who decided to delay the publication of his first budget until December instead of September. Some people are not happy about this because it gives them less time to look at the budget plans and make sure they are good before they vote on them in February. He delayed the budget because of some changes happening in the UK and Scotland, and he wants to see what the new Chancellor, Philip Hammond, says in his statement on November 23.

Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth. Immanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 in Konigsberg, Prussia (since 1946 the city of Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697-1737), was also born in Konigsberg to a father from Nuremberg. (Her name is sometimes erroneously given as Anna Regina Porter.) His father, Johann Georg Kant (1682-1746), was a German harness maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaipeda, Lithuania). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin. While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of Priekule) and were of Curonian origin. Kant was the fourth of nine children (four of them reached adulthood). Baptized 'Emanuel', he changed his name to 'Immanuel' after learning Hebrew.  Young Kant was a solid, albeit unspectacular, student. Kant was born into a Prussian German family of Lutheran Protestant faith in East Prussia. He was brought up in a Pietist household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science. Kant maintained a belief in Christianity, in his work Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals he reveals a belief in human immortality as the necessary condition of our continued approach to the highest good possible. However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of Theism and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the soul, various commentators have labelled him a philosophical agnostic.  Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime. It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life -- he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Konigsberg.  A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Konigsberg his whole life. In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (Hauslehrer) in Judtschen (now Veselovka, Russia, approximately 20 km) and in Gross-Arnsdorf (now Jarnoltowo near Morag (German: Mohrungen), Poland, approximately 145 km).

The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location.

Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean.  After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline.  Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard.

Packet switching is the fundamental technology that underpins the internet, allowing data to be separated into smaller packets, transmitted, and then reassembled at their destination. One of the first networks to utilize this technology was ARPANET, which was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense's research agency, ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency). ARPANET's first successful message was sent on October 29, 1969, between two computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). This milestone can be considered as the beginning of the internet, although the term \\"internet\\" itself was not coined until 1974 when Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a set of rules that dictate how data is transmitted and received across multiple networks. This protocol became the standard for data communication and laid the foundation for the internet as we know it today. The internet continued to evolve throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the addition of various networks and technologies, the development of email, and the establishment of the Domain Name System (DNS) to simplify addressing on the network. However, it was the creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and its public release in 1991 that truly revolutionized the way people used the internet. The web provided a user-friendly interface for accessing and sharing information, paving the way for the rapid growth and widespread adoption of the internet in the 1990s and beyond.

The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new.

First, we will handle the constants: 630 - 1141 + 5527.  630 - 1141 = -511 -511 + 5527 = 5016 So, the equation becomes: -2508d + 5016 = 0 Now, we want to isolate 'd' so that we can find its value. To do that, we will move the '5016' to the other side of the equation: -2508d = -5016 Now, we simply divide both sides of the equation by -2508 to find the value of 'd': d = -5016 / -2508 d = 2 So, the answer is d = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736 for c.","output":"To solve for c in the equation -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736, you want to isolate c on one side. Here's how you can walk through the solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on right side of the equation. The equation is currently: -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736. We can combine 1936 and 736 on the right hand side (RHS): 1936 + 736 = 2672. This simplifies the equation to: -2536 = -124*c + 2672. Step 2: Move 2672 from RHS to left hand side (LHS) of the equation. You can do this by subtracting 2672 from both sides.  -2536 - 2672 = -124*c + 2672 - 2672. Which further simplifies the equation to: -5212 = -124*c. Step 3: Solve for c. To get c alone on the RHS, we divide both sides by -124. (-5212)/(-124) = -124c/(-124) This simplifies to: 42 = c. So, the solution to the equation -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736 is c = 42."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team experienced an increased blood flow to the muscles?  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Brown team experienced an increased blood flow to the muscles. This is because they arrived in time and started their warm-up before the competition, which allowed their bodies to gradually prepare for the physical activity.  Warming up is crucial for athletes as it helps increase the blood flow to muscles and tendons, raises the heart rate, and enhances muscle flexibility and overall performance. By going through a proper warm-up routine, the Brown team effectively reduced their chances of experiencing injuries during the competition.  On the other hand, the Green team arrived late and skipped their warm-up, which led to some of their athletes getting injured. Without properly warming up, the blood flow to their muscles was not adequately increased, making them more prone to injuries when engaging in the competition. As a result, the Green team's performance could have been negatively impacted to some extent due to these injuries, highlighting the importance of a warm-up routine in athletic activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Leadership is the art of getting someone to do something you want done because he wants to do it. People naturally want to follow a good leader. After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired, and motivated to work towards a common goal. An effective leader makes others feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing. The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve, and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it. One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture, so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result. Good leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future. Their enthusiasm wins them plenty of supporters who help make their vision a reality. Good leaders also understand that different people are motivated by different things. For employees motivated by a need for achievement, a leader explains how the task offers an opportunity to take on a challenge with an achievable goal. And employees are motivated by hearing how they will be part of a team of people working together. Good leaders will introduce employees by name first, rather than job titles. They refer to employees as team members, companions, or colleagues, never as \\"servants\\". Words have power, including the power to make people feel whether or not they are important to the success of an organization. Good leaders believe that every team member matters and set up environments that make everyone feel important. It is no wonder they can attract the support they need to help them achieve their goals. Question: We can infer from the passage that  _  . - a good leader is always good at creating comfortable working conditions - the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal - names are much easier to remember than job titles - the motivation of the employees all comes from the leader The answer is:","output":"the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Jón Þór \\"Jónsi\\" Birgisson (born 23 April 1975) is the guitarist and vocalist for the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. He is known for his use of a cello bow on guitar and his falsetto or countertenor voice. He is blind in his right eye from birth as a result of a broken optic nerve from the brain. He is openly gay. Apart from Sigur Rós, Jónsi also performs together with his partner Alex Somers as an art collaboration called Jónsi & Alex. They released their self-titled first book in November 2006, which was an embossed hardcover limited to 1000 copies, along with their first album, \\"Riceboy Sleeps\\", in July 2009.  On 1 December 2009, Jónsi's official website, jonsi.com, was launched in anticipation of his debut solo album, \\"Go\\", which was released the week of 5 April 2010. After the release of the album, Jónsi promptly started a worldwide tour across North America and Europe, featuring songs from the album plus a few other selections, planning to tour from March to September.  - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined.  - Riceboy Sleeps is the debut studio album by ambient duo Jónsi & Alex, released on 20 July 2009. The album is an artistic collaboration between Sigur Rós vocalist Jón Þór Birgisson and partner Alex Somers which features acoustic instrumental music alongside a string quartet, Amiina, and the Kópavogsdætur Choir.  - Alex Somers (born 7 March 1984) is an American visual artist and musician from Baltimore, Maryland. He is currently living in Reykjavík, Iceland with his long-time boyfriend, Jón \\"Jónsi\\" Þór Birgisson, the vocalist and guitar player for the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. Somers runs a recording studio in downtown Reykjavík where he produces, engineers, and mixes since 2010.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.  - Sigurrós is an Icelandic female name, formed by conjoining \\"sigur\\" (victory) and \\"rós\\" (rose). Over 200 women currently carry it as their first given name and around 100 as their second or third given name.  - Reykjavík  is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay. With a population of around 130,000 (and over 200,000 in the Capital Region), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity.  - Sigur Rós is an Icelandic post-rock band from Reykjavík, who have been active since 1994. Known for their ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi's falsetto vocals, and the use of bowed guitar, the band's music is also noticeable for its incorporation of classical and minimalist aesthetic elements.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Is your spider moving around less than usual? Tarantulas often stop moving or don't move at all to conserve energy before a molt. If your tarantula has not been moving much lately, then this could be a sign that she is about to molt. Is your tarantula eating? Before a big molt, tarantulas will stop eating for extended periods of time, ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months. If you have noticed that your tarantula has not been eating or that she has been eating less than usual, then this could indicate that she is going to molt soon. Some tarantulas secrete tiny drops of a clear fluid between the joints on their legs, and this can indicate that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Check to see if you can see these droplets, but keep in mind that not all tarantulas do this before a molt. Some tarantulas will lose hair on their abdomens leading up to a molt. You might notice less hair on your tarantula’s abdomen or even a bald spot on your tarantula’s abdomen. If you see this, then it is a good sign that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Your tarantula’s abdomen may also appear darker and shinier than usual before she molts. What position is the spider in? During a molt, a tarantula lays up-side down on her back or on her side to get out of the old skin easier. This happens when a tarantula is actively molting and the whole process takes just a few hours. If your tarantula is on her back or side, then she might be trying to molt her skin. Spiders curl up their legs tightly underneath them when they die. If your tarantula is on her stomach and has curled her legs tightly inwards, then she may be dead or dying. Summary:","output":"This article explains various signs that can indicate a tarantula is preparing to molt, including decreased movement and eating, secretion of a clear fluid from their joints, loss of hair on the abdomen, and a darker, shinier abdomen. It emphasizes the change in positioning, such as lying on their back or side, during the actual molting process and distinguishes this behavior from the curling up their legs underneath them when they die."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The show features the Duggar family: parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children—9 girls and 10 boys, all of whose names begin with the letter \\"J\\". During the life of the show, three children were born, three children were married, and four grandchildren were born.      The show focuses on the life of the Duggar family, who are devout Baptists,[1] and frequently discusses values of purity, modesty, and faith in God. The Duggars avoid birth control saying they have decided to allow God to determine the number of children they have. All of the children are homeschooled, and access to entertainment such as movies and television is limited. They practice chaperoned courtship, in which a couple becomes acquainted only in a group setting.[2] The values presented on the show have been associated with the Quiverfull movement, which has been described as promoting strict family conformity, male hierarchies, and subservient roles for women.[3][4][5] The Duggars have stated they are not associated with the Quiverfull movement.[6]      The series began on September 29, 2008 and concluded on May 19, 2015.[7] The show was TLC's most popular, averaging 2.3 million viewers per new episode in Season 10, and scoring in the Nielsen \\"Cable Top 25\\".[8][9]      On May 22, 2015, TLC suspended the series when the Duggars' eldest son Josh publicly apologized for having \\"acted inexcusably\\" following reports that he molested five girls, including some of his sisters, by fondling them. These events occurred in 2002 and 2003, when he was 14 to 15 years of age, and prior to the beginning of the show. On July 16, 2015, TLC (The Learning Channel) announced that the show was officially canceled and would not resume production.[10] A spin-off show, Counting On, aired in December 2015 and the fourth season premiered June 12, 2017.[11]      Background [ edit ]      The Duggars live in Tontitown, Arkansas, near Springdale, and originally appeared in several TLC and Discovery Health one-hour specials, mostly focused on four of Michelle's last five deliveries.[12][13] Jim Bob Duggar has an older sister, Deanna, who occasionally appears on the show. Michelle Duggar (née Ruark) has six older siblings (Pamela Ethel, Kathie Ann, Evelyn Alice, Carolyn Jeannite, Freda Louise, and Garrett Floyd Jr.). The couple met in the early 1980s when Duggar and a fellow church member were sent for a follow-up visit after Michelle experienced a religious conversion.[14] The Duggars were married on July 21, 1984, just after Michelle's high school graduation. When they married, she was 17 and he was 19; neither attended college. Together they first launched a used-car business, then towing and real estate businesses, and both are licensed real estate agents.[15][16]      The Duggars initially chose to wait before having children and used birth control pills in the early years of their marriage. Their eldest child, Joshua, was born in 1988. They resumed using oral contraceptives after his birth but conceived again despite this precaution, Michelle miscarried. She has mentioned that they named that child Caleb, despite not knowing the baby's gender.[17] After consulting a doctor, the Duggars learned that birth control can in some cases allow conception but cause miscarriage. As a result, they decided to stop using birth control and allow God to determine the number of children they would have.[18] Michelle soon became pregnant again, this time with her first set of twins, Jana and John-David. Michelle gave birth 17 times (twice with twins) over a period of 21 and a half years, approximately one birth every 15 months on average.      The Duggars are devout independent Baptists. They only watch programs they consider to be wholesome family television and various historical events. Their Internet service is filtered. They adhere to certain standards of modesty in clothing in accordance with their religious beliefs. Shorts and tank tops are prohibited, and the women do not wear skirts that go above the knee. According to Michelle Duggar, such standards are mandated by scripture. They believe that baring the thigh is \\"nakedness and shame\\", and runs the risk of \\"defrauding\\" others—or stirring up and arousing \\"desires in someone else that cannot be righteously fulfilled.\\" They avoid beaches and public swimming areas \\"because it's just too hard for the guys to try to keep their eyes averted in those situations.\\"[19] Female family members keep their hair long, and males are clean-shaven and short-haired. They practice chaperoned courtship, where the couple gets to know each other in a group setting. The Duggars describe this as \\"dating with a purpose\\" and the Daily Mail describes it as a \\"G-rated alternative to dating.\\"[2]      The Duggars in 2007      Jim Bob Duggar served as a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002. He was defeated for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate by incumbent Tim Hutchinson in 2002 by a vote of 71,576 to 20,546.[20] He later became a real estate agent and investor. The Duggars' income is derived from rental proceeds of commercial properties they own.[15][21] They live debt-free.[22][23]      Construction of their 7,000 square-foot (650 square-meter) house began in 2000 when they bought the lot and ordered two steel frames. One of the frames was not drilled correctly, so the Duggars received a third frame which was used to make the girls' room and the industrial kitchen.[24] Discovery Networks completed it, finding local Arkansas construction workers to donate their skills and time. The home was completed on January 20, 2006. Some of the painting, decorating, furnishings, appliances, and other finishing touches—such as a stocked pantry—were provided by Discovery Networks and corporate sponsors as part of the one-hour television special[15] entitled 16 Children and Moving In.      Events during the series [ edit ]      Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar      Michelle Duggar gave birth via emergency Caesarean section to Josie Brooklyn Duggar on December 10, 2009, six months into her pregnancy. When she was rushed to the hospital for gallstones, doctors discovered that she was pre-eclamptic and performed an emergency delivery. Josie Duggar was premature at only 1 pound 6 ounces (0.62 kg) at birth. Nearly four months later, on April 6, 2010, the Duggars were able to take the infant to their temporary rental home in Little Rock while they awaited medical approval to take her home to Tontitown.[25][26]      The Duggars took Josie home to Tontitown for good on June 23, 2010. By that December she weighed 15 pounds 12 ounces (7.1 kg).[27]      The couple had discussed the possibility of having more children, with Michelle Duggar saying:      We would love more! I'm 43, almost 44 this September. I know that my mommy years are probably numbered, and I don't know how many more children God will see fit to give me. ... [I]t is something we've been praying about because we do love children. Each child really is a gift and that doesn't mean just our children. We asked the Lord to give us a love of children the way He loves children. That is something that we've prayed about, and we'll just see what the Lord has in store for our family in the future.[28]      On December 2, 2008, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's book The Duggars: 20 and Counting! was released.[29] Their second book, A Love That Multiplies, was released on June 7, 2011.[30] The eldest four girls—Jana, Jill, Jessa, and Jinger—authored Growing Up Duggar: It's All About Relationships, which was released March 4, 2014.[31]      On November 8, 2011, Michelle Duggar and family appeared on NBC's Today Show to announce she was expecting their 20th child.[32] On December 8, 2011, the Duggars announced she had miscarried.[33] Six days later, they held a memorial service for the stillborn baby girl that they named Jubilee Shalom (which means celebration and peace).[34][35]      A few months after the birth of their daughter Mackynzie, Josh and Anna Duggar learned that she was pregnant with their second child, but the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.[36] On their daughter's first birthday, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting again. The couple welcomed their second child, Michael James, on June 15, 2011.[37] They learned that they were expecting again in September 2012.      Josh Duggar was offered a job at the Family Research Council during his wife's pregnancy with their third child. Marcus Anthony was delivered by a midwife on June 2, 2013.[37] Duggar announced he was hired to be the executive director of the Family Research Council's political action committee, FRC Action, on June 18, 2013, and the family would move to Washington, D.C.[38]      On December 2, 2014, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting their fourth child.[39] The couple welcomed their fourth child, Meredith Grace, on July 16, 2015. They announced her birth on July 19, 2015 through the Duggar family website.[40]      The Duggars issued an announcement that Jessa Duggar was in a courtship with Ben Seewald on September 18, 2013. The couple met through their church.[41][42] On August 15, 2014, after eleven months of courtship, the couple announced their engagement[43][44] and were married on November 1, 2014.[45]      Jill Duggar's courtship with Derick Dillard was announced on March 31, 2014. They were introduced by Jim Bob Duggar and became further acquainted via supervised Skype and text conversations while Dillard was serving as a missionary in Nepal. Jill Duggar and her father traveled to Nepal to meet Dillard in person and began a formal courtship in November 2013.[46] The couple announced their engagement on April 9, 2014,[47] and were married on June 21, 2014.[48][49]      The Dillards announced their first pregnancy on August 20, 2014.[50] Their son, Israel David Dillard, was born on April 6, 2015.[51]      The Seewalds announced their first pregnancy on April 21, 2015, waiting until the second trimester.[52]      On July 16, 2015, TLC announced that the series was officially canceled.[10]      Reception [ edit ]      Arnold Hamilton of The Dallas Morning News described 19 Kids and Counting as \\"part Little House on the Prairie, part Yours, Mine & Ours–except the only blending in this real-life family occurs with restaurant like precision at mealtimes.\\" He described the Duggars as acting \\"against the trend\\", considering the 2002 US Census found that only 0.3 percent of women ages 15 to 44 have given birth to seven or more children and that this number has declined steadily since 1976.[15]      In an op-ed for The New York Observer, Nina Burleigh described the Duggars as \\"Good TV. Good, sugarcoated rat poison, politically speaking\\", referring to the Duggars political activity such as their opposition to abortion and their lobbying efforts against legislation which would allow transgender people use of public restrooms matching their gender identity.[53]      In an article published in the Journal of Religion and Popular Culture, Christy Mesaros-Winckles described the Duggars as \\"unofficial spokespeople for the Quiverfull movement\\". Referring to the first season of the show, Mesaros-Winckles said the Duggars introduced themselves and their religious beliefs with the \\"subtle and disturbing\\" message of conformity and \\"rigid male hierarchy\\" associated with the Quiverfull movement. Mesaros-Winckles asserts that the show provides a platform for the legitimization of this movement, while downplaying \\"patriarchal gender roles and strict family conformity.\\" Mesaros-Winckles also said the Duggars \\"try to convince the audience that their way of life is best for raising healthy, godly children\\" and that a large family is a \\"biblical mandate.\\" She concluded that despite the small size of the Quiverfull movement, with perhaps only several thousand followers, the show 19 Kids and Counting has brought the movement to the forefront of American culture.[5]      Feminist Amanda Marcotte referred to the Duggars as part of the \\"Christian patriarchy movement\\", which she described as interchangeable with the Quiverfull movement, saying the Duggars promote sexist values which run counter to mainstream American culture.[3] The Duggars have said they are not part of the Quiverfull movement, stating: \\"we are simply Bible-believing Christians who desire to follow God's Word and apply it to our lives\\".[6]      Criticism [ edit ]      The Duggar family has received criticism due to their stance on LGBT issues. In August 2014, Michelle Duggar recorded a political robocall regarding legislation affecting transgender individuals, which The Huffington Post described as \\"transphobic\\" and The Washington Post described as \\"anti-anti-discrimination.\\" The robocall includes Michelle saying: \\"The Fayetteville City Council is voting on an ordinance this Tuesday night that would allow men – yes I said men – to use women's and girls restrooms, locker rooms, showers, sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only. I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.\\" In response to this robocall, a petition was started on Change.org calling for TLC to cancel the show 19 Kids and Counting, which received over 100,000 signatures. In response to the first petition, a second petition was started asking TLC to keep the show on the air, and it also received over 100,000 signatures.[54][55][56][57]      In November 2014, the Duggars asked married couples to take a picture while kissing and share it on their Facebook page. Several users noted that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted from the Duggar's Facebook page.[58] While working for the Family Research Council, the Duggar's eldest son, Josh Duggar, said \\"I truly believe every child deserves a mother and a father\\"; the Family Research Council has been labeled as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, with SPLC saying they were designated as such due to their publication of \\"anti-gay propaganda.\\"[59][60][61] Josh Duggar has been described as an \\"anti-gay activist\\" by GLAAD.[62]      Josh Duggar molestation controversy [ edit ]      On May 21, 2015, a police report from 2006 was revealed to the public by In Touch Weekly magazine, stating sexual molestation allegations against the Duggars' eldest son, Josh Duggar. The report states that in 2002–2003, Josh – then 14 to 15 years old – fondled five girls, including four of his sisters, by touching their breasts and genital regions on multiple occasions while they were asleep and in a few cases while awake.[63][64][65] These events occurred prior to the beginning of the reality series. The case was never fully investigated, and the statute of limitations has expired.[63] On May 22, 2015, TLC removed all reruns of the show that were previously set to air from its current airing schedule, with the statement, \\"we are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time.\\"[66][67][68]      In the wake of the controversy, more than 20 advertisers, including General Mills, Walgreens, Payless ShoeSource, Choice Hotels, Pizza Hut, Sweet Leaf Tea, and Crayola announced that they were pulling their ads from the show;[69][70][71] Hulu also removed the show's entire back catalog of episodes from the streaming service.[72] Public reaction to the revelation led to several petitions calling for TLC to cancel the series on Change.org, citing conflict between the reported events and the show's promotion of family values.[65][73][74]      Josh, along with his wife and his parents, responded to the revelations. Josh apologized, stating he had \\"acted inexcusably\\", and resigned from his position at the Family Research Council. Anna stated she knew about Josh's actions two years before she married him, and believed that the counseling he received after the incidents \\"changed his life.\\" The Duggars described this time as a dark period in their lives and said it caused their family \\"to seek God like never before.\\" They were featured in an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File on June 3, 2015, where they answered questions regarding the scandal.[75][76][77][78]      Cancellation [ edit ]      On July 16, 2015, Discovery Communications, parent company of TLC, confirmed to CNN that the show was officially canceled and that all further production would be ceased. In the wake of the allegations, the network announced that it would produce a one-hour, commercial-free documentary special on child abuse, that will include Jill and Jessa.[10]      TLC paid the Duggar family an estimate of US25,000 to US45,000 per episode. Due to the show cancellation, the loss of endorsements, speaking engagements, and book deals based on the show would result in a loss of an estimate of US25 million a year.[79][80]      A 3-part spin-off series, Jill and Jessa: Counting On, focusing on newlyweds Jill and Derick Dillard, Jessa and Ben Seewald, Anna Duggar, and several of the other adult Duggar children (sans Josh) aired in December 2015.[81] Its first episode attracted more than 2.2 million viewers, according to a report by The Nielsen Company.[82] The third episode garnered the highest ratings and viewership, at 2.5 million viewers, and ranked in the Top 5 cable shows for the night.[83] In March 2016, it was announced Counting On had been picked up for a full season, that premiered March 15, 2016.[84]      Duggar family [ edit ]      Parents [ edit ]      They were married on July 21, 1984, aged 17 and 19, and have 19 children and 12 grandchildren.

Foals are a rock band from Oxford, England formed in 2005, consisting of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Yannis Philippakis, drummer and percussionist Jack Bevan, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Smith, and keyboardist Edwin Congreave. They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland.  Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London.  Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\"  According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\"  In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows. Holy Fire was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. Q awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while \\"Inhaler\\" received the Best Track award from NME. Not only this, but in a reader-nominated \\"Best Album of 2013\\" poll, Holy Fire topped the list; as did single \\"My Number\\" in a \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll, beating NME favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands. Did they play anywhere famous?","output":"Yes, Foals have played at several famous venues and festivals. They have performed at well-known international festivals such as Glastonbury, Coachella, and Roskilde. Additionally, they headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July 2013. In February, they played two sold-out shows at the famous Alexandra Palace in London, a notable contrast to their earlier performance at the same venue seven years before when they supported Bloc Party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He takes a moment to collect his thoughts, watching the other players as they ready themselves for the serve. As the fat boy tosses the ball into the air, he jumps and swings his arm with all his might. The ball soars across the net, surprising the opposing team with its velocity. Nonetheless, the opposing team's most experienced player, a tall girl with short, dark hair, manages to successfully dig the ball, sending it flying upwards into the air. The other teammates on the opposing team scramble into position, coordinating their movements effortlessly. One of the players, a tanned man with sunglasses, bumps the ball towards their designated setter. The setter, a petite woman with a focused expression, leaps into the air and sets the ball perfectly for the tanned man, who has already begun his approach to spike the ball. Meanwhile, the fat boy's team readies themselves for the incoming spike. The team consists of a diverse group of people of varying ages and skill levels, bonded by their shared love of the game.

Run the towels under cool water, then wring them out so they're damp but not dripping.","output":"Step 1: Apply an enzymatic cleaner  After absorbing the mess, apply a generous amount of enzymatic cleaner specifically designed for pet urine removal on the affected area of the carpet. Enzymatic cleaners break down the uric acid crystals in pet urine, which helps to eliminate the odor and stain. Read and follow the instructions on the cleaner's label carefully. Step 2: Let the cleaner sit Allow the enzymatic cleaner to sit on the stain for the recommended amount of time as indicated on the product label. This will give the cleaner enough time to break down the urine components effectively. Step 3: Blot the area After letting the cleaner sit for the appropriate amount of time, use clean, dry towels or paper towels to gently blot the area. This will help to absorb any remaining moisture and lift the stain from the carpet fibers. Step 4: Rinse the area with water Once the enzymatic cleaner has done its job, rinse the area with clean, cool water. Use a clean cloth or sponge to apply the water, being careful not to over-saturate the carpet. Step 5: Blot and dry After rinsing, blot the area again with dry towels or paper towels to remove excess water. Make sure to remove as much moisture as possible, as this will help to prevent any mold or mildew from forming. Step 6: Allow the carpet to air-dry Let the treated area air-dry completely. If necessary, use a fan to help speed up the drying process. Step 7: Vacuum the area Once the carpet is completely dry, vacuum the area to restore the carpet's texture and appearance. Your carpet should be free of pet urine stains and odor. Throughout this process, it's important to act quickly and follow product instructions in order to effectively remove pet urine from the carpet and prevent any lingering odors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This difference is minimal, and overall, the meaning and context are mostly the same, which is why the similarity is rated 4. Other options: a. 0 - This rating would suggest no similarity, which is not the case as both sentences describe a monkey swinging. b. 1 - This rating would indicate very little similarity, which is inaccurate as both sentences convey a similar meaning. c. 2 - This rating would suggest a low level of similarity, but since the primary action of the monkey is the same, it's too low to accurately represent the level of similarity. d. 3 - This rating would imply some similarity but still a significant difference, whereas, in reality, the difference between the objects in the sentences is quite minimal. f. 5 - This rating would suggest the sentences are identical in meaning, which is not entirely true as they differ in the objects the monkey swings between."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you feel lucky?\\" The hand turns the revolver and fires at the camera.Labor racketeer and local mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) drives away from court after being acquitted on a technicality for the killing of a labor union leader and his family, much to the outrage of a mob of protesters outside the courthouse. A San Francisco Police Department motorcycle cop with a photo on his dresser sees this on a TV broadcast and puts on his helmet and gear, then leaves his house.Ricca, his attorney Weinstein, a bodyguard, and his driver James \\"Gino\\" Cantina drive a limo south on I-280 towards Potrero Hill. The motorcycle cop we just saw earlier catches up to the car and gestures for the driver to pull over. The driver pulls off onto a side street at the next exit, and comes to a stop. The cop walks up to the car and asks the driver for his license, telling him that he illegally crossed a double-white line. At Ricca's attorney's urging, the driver reluctantly hands over his license. The cop goes back to his bike, supposedly to write down information in his ticket book. After a few minutes, he returns and asks the driver for his vehicle registration. The driver asks to get his license back. In response, the cop suddenly whips his revolver out and shoots the limo driver in the side of the face. He then shoots the bodyguard in the passenger's seat as he tries to draw a pistol. He then puts two bullets each into Ricca and his attorney in the backseat. With all four men dead, the cop holsters his smoking revolver, walks back to his motorcycle and rides away.Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Earlington 'Early' Smith (Felton Perry) drive by the crime scene, but are asked to leave by Harry's newest adversary...

When her mom first made it, it was white. The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night. Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night. On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor. To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him. She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went. Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days. There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him! So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times. During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket. At night, she puts him under her pillow. She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What caused Marsha to begin taking extra special care of Joey?\\" is \\"The dog buried him\\"?","output":"No, the information provided in the paragraph doesn't support the statement \\"The dog buried him.\\" There's no mention of Mika, Marsha's dog, burying Joey. Marsha began to pay extra special attention to Joey's safety due to a couple of incidents where Mika, the family dog, attempted to take Joey away from Marsha with the intention of eating him. Because of this, Marsha made a firm decision to ensure Joey was protected at all times, keeping him in a plastic bag in her pocket during the day and under her pillow at night. These precautions were taken to prevent Mika from getting hold of and attempting to eat Joey again.  Marsha's increased care for Joey's safety wasn't instigated by Mika burying Joey, but rather the dog trying to eat Joey. The text does not detail any incident where the family dog buries Joey. Therefore, it would be incorrect to respond with \\"The dog buried him\\" as the reason Marsha began taking extra special care of Joey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The TMJ works like a hinge, but also uses a sliding motion. The joint also has cartilage, including a small disc of cartilage that acts as a sort of shock absorber. This disc can become damaged by arthritis, injury, or infection, or the disc can be out of alignment, causing pain. TMJ pain can also be associated with a clicking sound when you chew or talk, or there may be a sensation of grinding.  Some people with TMJ have other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic headache, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, bladder inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, sleep disorders, and painful sexual intercourse in women. It is not clear that TMJ and these other disorders are necessarily connected. TMJ occurs in both men and women, but women tend to have more severe pain and limitation of movement than men. The primary symptom of TMJ is pain in the joint and in the muscles of the jaw.  Other symptoms include:  Pain in the neck and in the shoulders Chronic headaches Stiffness in the jaw muscles Limitations in jaw movement Locking of the jaw Pain or pressure in the ear Ringing in the ears Painful clicking, popping, or grating in the jaw joint when the mouth is opening or closing A bite that feels off or is misaligned If you have any of these symptoms, it is recommended that you see a medical doctor as well as a pain specialist for treatment.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!  Now, I have a new situation: Two six graders learned about the lives of animals. Lori learned more about fish, while Dan learned more about mammals.  Answer this question please: Which student learned less about gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream? A:","output":"A: Dan, the student who learned more about mammals, learned less about gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream as compared to Lori, who learned about fish. This is because the given background information highlights the unique features of gas exchange in mammals' lungs, which would better relate to Lori's studies on fish as mammals' lung structure and their gas exchange mechanism may not apply to fish directly.

The interview was conducted in the cafe rather than the office, as the","output":"employer wanted a relaxed and casual environment instead of a stiff and formal one. The cafe was warm and cozy, filled with the rich aroma of freshly ground coffee beans. Mr. Lawrence, the employer, was waiting at a corner table sipping on his latte. He wore a great smile when Jack, the interviewee, arrived. He stood up to greet Jack with a firm handshake, showing his welcoming character. Step 1: Establishing the setup Firstly, I have described the venue based on the introductory sentence. It helps to engage the reader with a detailed description of the cafe's ambiance. Given the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the employer was already present and waiting. The employer’s traits, as well as some character development, have been attempted. This makes the story more relatable and immersive for readers. Next, Jack arrived, and Mr. Lawrence greeted him. This sets up for the interview's initiation, starting the main part of the plot. The two men sat down, facing each other. It was Jack’s first ever interview, and he was nervous, his palms slightly sweaty. Seeing this, Mr. Lawrence, with a comforting smile, tried to ease his nerves by sharing a light-hearted anecdote from his early career. The strategy worked. Jack laughed, and his shoulders relaxed a bit, signaling a reduction in his anxiety. Step 2: Developing actions Continuing the narrative, I have added more specifics about the characters' actions. This includes their feelings and reactions, which will help further develop the character image for readers and also progress the plot. As they let the conversation flow naturally, they talked about their favorite books, shared interesting life events, and discussed the job and its aspects in between. Mr. Lawrence could see Jack's passion for the work. He noticed Jack’s active participation and thoughtful questioning, which resonated with Mr. Lawrence’s idea of an ideal candidate for the job. Step 3: Further expanding the plot I've expanded the conversation in order to progress the story's core aim, i.e., the interview process, while keeping it engaging and natural. This also gives the employer a chance to gauge the candidate. Furthermore, these details enable the readers to become more involved in the story. The interview lasted about an hour. By the end, the cafe was alive with the chatter of patrons, and the delicious scent of pastries filled the room. Mr. Lawrence put down his now empty coffee cup and thanked Jack for his time. The young man left the café with a sense of satisfaction and hope. No matter the outcome, he was sure that he had gained invaluable experience from the process. Step 4: Concluding the event Finally, I concluded the event by describing the immediate atmosphere and stating the end of the interview. Indicating Jack's feelings provides closure and also opens up possibilities for continuing the story later on. This gives the readers a complete understanding of the event while keeping them intrigued about the potential results of the interview.  I kept the ending positive, focusing on Jack's personal growth and learning from the experience rather than the immediate success or failure of the interview. This aligns with realistic scenarios, making the closure more relatable for readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Step 3: Staying hydrated To maintain her vitality and appearance while jogging, Maria prioritized staying adequately hydrated. Drinking water in small sips throughout her jog not only replenished her body's fluids lost due to sweating but also aided in achieving that refreshing glow on her skin. She considered carrying a water bottle to be an essential aspect of her jogging routine. Step 4: Cooling down and post-jog routine As Maria approached the end of her jog, she would gradually slow her pace to a brisk walk for the last few minutes, allowing her body to return to normal and keep her sweating under control. Once back home, she would immediately change out of her sweaty clothes and take a shower to rid her body of any accumulated dirt and sweat. Step 5: Moisturizing the skin and replenishing nutrients Maria believed that cleansing her body from sweat was not enough. After her shower, she would moisturize her skin to restore any lost moisture and maintain a healthy and fresh appearance. Maria would also replenish her energy and nutrients by having a balanced breakfast, ensuring that she was taking care of herself both internally and externally. In conclusion, Maria managed to achieve the perfect balance between looking fresh and avoiding excessive dirtiness by following a mindful routine during and after her morning jog. This balance helped her maintain her appearance and personal hygiene while enjoying the benefits of regular exercise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' would,no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'. As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor. From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island, named Summerisle(the original) to a near Amazon-ic colony off the Maine coast of the US, named Summersisle, the remake hardly hits the spot. This is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS.

Write some highlights for the following article: Champion cyclist Lance Armstrong won't be allowed to compete in international Ironman triathlon contests while he's under investigation for doping, the World Triathlon Corporation announced Thursday. The ruling bars him from the Ironman France competition scheduled for June 24 in Nice, the agency said. The decision comes after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, confirmed Wednesday that it is opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. Armstrong said Wednesday the agency intends to \\"dredge up discredited\\" doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. The champion cyclist has always insisted he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong was accused of using such drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Armstrong started doing triathlons after retiring from cycling, and won a half-Ironman in Hawaii less than two weeks ago. He was the fastest cyclist and runner on the 70.3-mile course, and the third-fastest swimmer. But with the new investigation open, the World Triathlon Corporation suspended him. WTC rules \\"dictate an athlete is ineligible to compete during an open investigation. Armstrong is therefore suspended from competing in WTC-owned and licensed races pending further review,\\" the organization said in a statement. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. \\"Lance Armstrong is currently still eligible to compete in all USA Triathlon-sanctioned races, with the exception of Ironman events as stated earlier by the World Triathlon Corporation,\\" said the body's communications director Chuck Menke. Armstrong lashed out at his accusers and the doping agency on Wednesday. \\"Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,\\" Armstrong said on his website. \\"That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence.\\" A 15-page agency letter was sent Tuesday to Armstrong and several others. The Washington Post was the first to report the story. Justice Department prosecutors in February said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. \\"These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation,\\" Armstrong said Wednesday. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were \\"fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions.\\" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of blood cells. Opinion: Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong. The letter said Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011. Riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, according to the letter. In a statement obtained by CNN, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis T. Tygart said the five other people, formerly associated with the U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team, are three team doctors and two team officials. The letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations, Tygart said. \\"USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence,\\" Tygart said. \\"We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence.\\" All named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. Armstrong said the organization has \\"self-written rules\\" and punishes first and adjudicates the facts later. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News \\"60 Minutes\\" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. \\"I saw it in his refrigerator,\\" Hamilton told the American news program. \\"I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times.\\" On his Twitter page, Armstrong at the time said he never failed a drug test. Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject banned substances. CNN's Steve Almasy, Gary Morley, Terry Frieden and Jason Durand contributed to this report.","output":"- World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) suspends Lance Armstrong from competing in international Ironman triathlons due to ongoing doping investigation. - Armstrong is barred from the Ironman France competition on June 24 in Nice. - U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) opens proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates, accusing them of doping between 1998 and 2011. - Armstrong denies the allegations and states he never failed a drug test in over 25 years of competing as an endurance athlete. - Despite the suspension from WTC events, USA Triathlon confirms Armstrong is still eligible to compete in its sanctioned races."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, keeping their shares in the market would lead to a loss, which they want to avoid. Step 2: Analyze Option B - Trade in their shares. - Trading in their shares could mean selling them. The context suggests that the others would want to sell their shares to avoid losing all their money. Step 3: Analyze Option C - Support others to also sell their shares. - While supporting others to sell their shares could be a potential action they take to avoid everyone losing money, the context focuses on the immediate concern of what the others will want to do for themselves to prevent their own losses.

The process described here is the weathering of rocks due to temperature fluctuations and water. Let me justify the steps: 1. Water seeps into rocks: Water finds its way into small cracks and pores in the rock formations. 2. The water freezes and thaws: As the weather fluctuates, the water within the cracks expands when it freezes (turns into ice) and contracts when it thaws (melts back into water). This puts pressure on the surrounding rock material. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: Due to the repeated freeze-thaw cycles, cracks in the rocks become more pronounced. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: When rocks are heated, they expand. This expansion can also create or widen existing cracks. These weathering processes weaken the rock structure, and the final step is the fragmentation or breaking of rocks into smaller pieces.

However, these professionals cannot help out everyone just by themselves. They need our help! Consider Volunteering! What Exactly is Volunteering? Volunteering is when we regularly go and do nice things for other people. Volunteers may help out in local retirement homes, or in hospitals. Some volunteers work with poor people and other volunteers help teach orphaned  children to read. There are many types of volunteers who help those who need help the most. Volunteering Teaches Mature  Thinking Volunteering is something that really helps us as individuals. It gives us a chance to stop complaining about our own lives, and realized exactly how lucky we are. We are able to see the people who really need help. Volunteering also teaches us more about responsibility, patience, empathy , and above all, compassion . Doing Our part!   Volunteering gives us a chance to do our share of the work of making this society the best it possibly can be. It helps us feel good about ourselves when we can help those who really need our help. When we can make someone else feel special, it helps us remember what life is really about. Ways to Start Volunteering There are many places that you can go to try to start volunteering. Here are just a few places you can go and what you can do at each place. 1) Hospital-ask if you can go and visit people who are really sick. Sometimes all they need is just someone who will talk with, or someone to give them hope. 2) Orphanage-the children living here really need someone to play with them. 3) Food Shelter --many food shelters can really use more people willing to just organize the shelters and help distribute the food to those who need it. Whatever you decide to do, just do the best you can. Remember that giving can be its own reward! Answer:","output":"Which one of the following is NOT mentioned as a benefit of volunteering in the article? A) Volunteering teaches us more about responsibility, patience, empathy, and compassion.

D) Volunteering gives us a chance to do our share of the work in making society better. The correct answer is C) Volunteering makes us rich in monetary terms.

How to bridle a grumpy horse  Halter and tie your horse.  Your horse should be haltered and tied before attempting to put the bridle on. Keep them tied fairly short on the lead.","output":"Step 1: Approach the horse calmly and confidently As horses can sense the emotions of humans, it is important to approach the grumpy horse with a calm and confident demeanor. This will help reduce the chance that the horse will resist or become agitated during the bridling process. Approaching the horse from the side rather than from the front or back can help avoid spooking the animal. Step 2: Comfort the horse with a gentle touch Before you try to bridle the horse, use a gentle touch to comfort and calm them down. Slowly stroke the horse's neck and shoulders while speaking softly and reassuringly. This will help relax them and make them more amenable to being bridled. Step 3: Check the bridle for proper fit and condition Before placing the bridle on the grumpy horse, ensure that it is clean, in good condition, and properly adjusted for the particular horse. This will help prevent discomfort or injury once it is put on. Step 4: Prepare the bridle Hold the bridle in your right hand, while using your left hand to grasp the cheekpiece. This will make it easier to slip the bit into the horse's mouth. Taking care to prevent the bit from hitting the horse's teeth can help avoid unnecessary discomfort and reduce the risk of resistance. Step 5: Gently pull the horse's head down Using your left hand, gently apply pressure to the top of the horse's head, encouraging them to lower their head to a more manageable height for bridle placement. Step 6: Present the bit to the horse With the horse's head lowered, present the bit to their mouth. Gently nudge their lips apart with your right hand, allowing the bit to be inserted. Encourage the horse to accept the bit by offering a gentle voice command or even a small treat. Step 7: Secure the bridle Once the bit is properly in the horse's mouth, carefully slip the crown of the bridle over the horse's ears one at a time. Adjust any straps or buckles as necessary to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. Step 8: Reassure the horse After the bridle is secured, give the horse a gentle pat on the neck and some more soothing words to acknowledge their cooperation. This will help reinforce positive behavior and make future bridling experiences easier. Step 9: Release the halter Once the bridle is properly in place and the horse is calm, gently remove the halter and lead. This will allow you to proceed with whatever activity you have planned with your horse. Step 10: Monitor for any signs of discomfort Throughout your time with the horse, keep an eye out for any signs of discomfort or irritation. If anything seems amiss, double-check the bridle's fit and make any necessary adjustments.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted?  SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.

Answer based on context:  After a disappointing loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked to bounce back against the lowly Vikings who were without Adrian Peterson who was suspended, but were led by ex-Patriot Matt Cassel at quarterback. The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended Adrian Peterson, Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards.

Answer the question...what is the canada us air quality agreement??","output":"The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement is a bilateral environmental accord between Canada and the United States. It was originally signed on March 13, 1991, with the primary objective of reducing and addressing transboundary air pollution in both countries, specifically acid rain and its subsequent environmental impacts. The agreement is focused on minimizing the emission of air pollutants that contribute to various environmental issues, including smog, poor air quality, and even climate change. The need for the agreement emerged during the latter half of the 20th century when acid rain became a significant concern for both nations. Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from power plants, industries, and vehicles mix with atmospheric water vapor and fall back to the earth in the form of acids. This phenomenon severely damages ecosystems, water sources, soil quality, and even human health. The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement addresses this problem and aims to protect the environment and the health of citizens in both countries. It comprises two annexes which detail the procedures and commitments to reduce emissions: 1. The first annex, known as Annex 1: Acid Rain Annex, was signed in 1991 alongside the primary agreement. It primarily targets the reduction in SO2 and NOx emissions responsible for creating acid rain. Both countries committed to substantial reductions in emissions from their power generation sector, with milestones and a time-frame for achieving these goals. The annex also sets up a framework for prompt exchange of information and data on emissions, ambient air quality, and deposition rates. 2. The second annex, known as Annex 2: Ozone Annex, was added in 2000 as a response to the increasing concern of ground-level ozone or smog in both Canada and the United States. The annex is focused on reducing the emissions of NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other precursors of ground-level ozone. It promotes the development and implementation of science-based emission reduction initiatives, particularly in areas where emissions negatively impact air quality in the other country. The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement also results in periodic progress reports, which serve to document the actions taken and the progress achieved in meeting the emission reduction commitments outlined in the annexes. This bilateral cooperation also facilitates joint scientific and technical research, education, and public awareness initiatives. Over the years, the agreement has been a successful collaborative effort between the two countries, as both have made significant progress in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions and improving overall air quality. Furthermore, this partnership allows them to address emerging transboundary air pollution issues, promote technological advancements, and share best practices for mitigating environmental problems related to air pollutants. In summary, the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement is a crucial environmental partnership between Canada and the United States. It recognizes the cooperative responsibility to address transboundary air pollution, reduce emissions, and protect natural resources, ecosystems, and the health of citizens in both countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When women bring home the bacon (The Frisky) -- Bread, bacon, clams - whatever you call it, women are the ones bringing it home these days. When your boyfriend or husband is unemployed and you're earning the dough, the relationship could suffer. According to The New York Times over the past year, as companies from Citibank to GM announced massive layoffs, a full 82 percent of the people getting pink slips have been men. Any day now, women are expected to become the majority of the American workforce. On the one hand, more women being primary money-makers is amazing-a real opportunity for us to get over the way-outdated idea that supporting a family is a man's job. But on the other hand, relationships can suffer when one source of income is lost and power dynamics shift. We talked to six women whose husbands/fiancé/boyfriends have lost their jobs. Here's how it's affecting their relationships: 1. Down to necessities. But now, he's needy. \\"My live-in boyfriend of 17 years lost his mechanical engineering job three months ago. We haven't gone out to a restaurant since and are buying store brands at the market. He'd never admit it-but he's become more needy. When I've had a stressful day at work, it's hard to come home and be upbeat and supportive.\\" --Lynn Brown, 44, life coach in Greenfield Center, New York 2. Forget love. He goes where the work is. \\"Between September and January, my boyfriend has been laid off four times. He applied for tons of jobs in Los Angeles, but got zero response. Then he posted his resume in Boston, where he's from. He got 10 calls quickly. We decided it was best for him to move back to Boston. The recession has split us up.\\" --Jennie, 27, counselor in Los Angeles 3.

I'm working around the clock, picking up hours so we can afford our apartment. I'll ask in the morning if he can do the laundry or figure out dinner. When I get home, it's obvious he's done nothing all day but play video games. I sympathize with him being out of work, but that's no excuse to not pick up the slack.\\" --Suzanne, 31, consultant in Chicago 5. Starting a family is even harder. \\"I'm nine months pregnant, I am so uncomfortable, and I just want to be at home. But, I'm at work. I have to stick it out until the very end because my husband recently lost his job as a consultant for Merrill Lynch.

I'll have to be back at work when our baby is a month old. It's just not what I had imagined.\\" --Katherine, clinical social worker in New York City 6. To be involved in their job search, or not to be? That is the question. \\"My husband has been out of work for months, and I don't get the impression he's doing enough to change the situation. I keep asking, 'What jobs did you apply for today? Did you talk to so-and-so about things at his company?' I feel like a total nag. I'm trying to figure out the line. Do I print out job listings for him, or is that totally emasculating?

This circumstance throws a new light on the gender roles within a relationship and can create a shift in traditional power dynamics. The article explores the experiences and reflections of six different women whose significant others have lost their jobs in the face of economic challenges. The women report various changes to their relationships and ways of living as a result of this situation. For example, some couples have had to forego luxuries and limit their spending to absolute necessities. Psychological changes in their partners are also observed, such as men becoming more needy due to the loss of their employment. In addition, the geographical presence of job opportunities has prompted couples to make tough decisions, with one woman's boyfriend choosing to move back to his hometown to find work, thereby splitting the couple up. The roles in the relationship change, with some men taking up domestic responsibilities. In some cases, this results in dissatisfaction where the woman feels her partner isn't pulling his weight despite the lack of employment, while in other cases it seems to work reasonably well. The crisis further complicates the issue of starting a family, where the woman must continue employment during pregnancy and cut maternity leave short to maintain income and health benefits, as her partner is unable to contribute financially. Finally, the article explores the question of involvement in the partner's job search, examining the tension between wanting to be supportive, not crossing personal boundaries, and avoiding the perception of nagging or emasculating their partners. All these changes and adaptations reflect the impact of economic hardships on intimate relationships and the evolving role of women as primary breadwinners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What is the full name of the drummer that finished the arena tour after health issues cause the touring drummer to drop out?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Following the release of With Teeth in 2005, the live band was reassembled for the Live: With Teeth tour.  Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of the band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined. To find replacements, Reznor held auditions during December 2004.  He stated that keyboardist Alessandro Cortini \\"fit in immediately\\", though he had trouble finding a guitarist to replace Robin Finck until auditioning Aaron North. The tour began with a series of small-club performances early in 2005. The band told journalists they were \\"pleasantly surprised by the interest\\" of fans despite their lengthy absence.  This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.  The band followed with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Death From Above 1979, Autolux, and Saul Williams. Williams performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. To conclude the With Teeth era of the band, Nine Inch Nails completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The 2007 release Beside You in Time features performances from the North American arena tour, the North American amphitheater tour, and a number of studio rehearsals.Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of \\"The Hand that Feeds\\". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails website: \\"apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me\\".  MTV replied by saying they respected Reznor's point of view, but were \\"uncomfortable\\" with the performance being \\"built around partisan political statements\\". A performance...

A title slide is then shown, and then shows several ingredients used in a recipe for cookies. The video then shows the two boys mixing ingredients together. they","output":"proceed to carefully measure each ingredient, ensuring they have the correct amount as per the recipe. The boys are following a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe, starting with the dry ingredients like flour, baking soda, and salt. They sift these together in a large mixing bowl, creating a uniform mixture that is free of clumps. Next, they move on to the wet ingredients. They begin by creaming together softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a separate mixing bowl. Once well combined and fluffy, they crack in one large, room-temperature egg and blend it into the butter-sugar mixture until further incorporated. They then add a generous splash of pure vanilla extract, which imparts a rich depth of flavor to the cookies. Once the wet ingredients are combined, the boys gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet, taking care not to overmix the cookie dough. Overmixing can lead to tough or dry cookies, so they carefully fold in the dry ingredients just until combined and no streaks of flour remain. With the dough almost ready, they turn their attention to the star of the show: the chocolate chips. In this case, they have chosen semi-sweet chocolate chips, which provide just the right balance of sweetness and bitterness to complement the dough. However, they also discuss other options like milk chocolate or white chocolate chips, and even mention the possibility of adding nuts or dried fruits, depending on personal preferences. After folding in the chocolate chips, ensuring an even distribution, they use a cookie scooper or a spoon to portion out dough balls onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Taking care to leave enough space between each dough ball for expansion during baking, they then preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) while they allow the dough to rest for a few minutes. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, they slide the prepared tray of cookie dough into the oven to bake for approximately 10-12 minutes. Throughout the baking process, they keep a close eye on the cookies to make sure they don't overcook, turning the tray halfway through for even baking. After the cookies have turned a golden brown around the edges and are slightly soft in the center, the boys remove the tray from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. They then carefully transfer the freshly baked cookies to a wire rack so they can cool completely. In the meantime, they proceed to clean up their workspace, washing mixing bowls, measuring spoons and other kitchen tools that were used during the recipe preparation. As they clean, they chat about their love for baking and other recipes they'd like to try in the future. Finally, with the cookies completely cooled, they taste their culinary creation. With wide grins on their faces and crumbs falling onto the table, they rejoice in the delicious outcome of their efforts, savoring the delicate balance of flavors and textures they achieved through following the cookie recipe. The video concludes with a recap of the recipe's steps, as well as a call for viewers to comment on their cookie-baking experiences and engaging with the subscribers by encouraging them to suggest other recipes they'd like to see in future videos. With this engaging and informative approach, the boys manage to share a beloved cookie recipe while also fostering a sense of community and excitement among their viewers who share a passion for home-baked goodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Question: \\"What are the names of five women who went to prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of women?\\" Response: \\"Nazar Ahari, Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat , Mahdiyeh Golrou\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

To maximize your smartphone's battery life, follow these comprehensive steps: 1. Update the software: Ensure that your device's operating system and apps are up to date. Developers often include battery life optimizations in software updates, which can improve performance and energy efficiency. 2. Optimize screen settings: The display is usually the most significant battery-drainer on smartphones. Consider lowering the brightness, enabling adaptive brightness (if available), and reducing the screen timeout interval. Additionally, avoid using live wallpapers, as they consume more power than static ones. 3. Manage background tasks: Some apps run in the background and consume power even when you are not using them actively. Identify these apps in your device settings, and either limit their background activity or uninstall them altogether if they are not crucial to your daily usage. 4. Enable power-saving mode: Many smartphones have a built-in power-saving or battery-saving mode that adjusts device settings to save energy automatically. Turn this on when you need a bit of extra juice to last the day. 5. Turn off connectivity features when not in use: Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and mobile data when you do not need them. Turning off location services or switching to battery-saving location mode can also save battery life. 6. Limit notifications: Frequent notifications not only consume power due to repeated phone vibrations or screen wake-ups but are also a constant distraction. Manage your app notifications in settings, turning off non-essential notifications, and customizing the notification frequency. 7. Disable automatic app updates: Updating apps over Wi-Fi or mobile data can quickly drain your battery. Go to your app store's settings, and turn off automatic updates. Schedule manual updates when your device is connected to a power source. 8. Use airplane mode in areas with weak signals: Searching for a signal consumes more power than maintaining a good connection. If you are in an area with a poor network, consider enabling airplane mode to save battery life. 9. Adjust app usage: Some apps, such as video streaming services or games, consume more power than others. Limit the usage of those apps when you need to save battery, or decrease the in-app settings like video quality for streaming apps. 10. Monitor app/device temperature: Devices that are continuously overworked or exposed to high temperatures can experience reduced battery life. Try to keep your device cool and give it a break if you notice it getting uncomfortably warm. 11. Disable syncing: Many apps sync data in real-time, which can be useful but also consumes power. Turning off auto-sync for specific apps can help save battery life. You can still manually sync when necessary. 12. Use battery-efficient apps: Opt for apps and services that offer battery-efficient options or consume less energy compared to their alternatives. 13. Charge your phone correctly: A good charging routine can help maintain your battery's health. Avoid using your phone while it's charging and unplug it when fully charged. Also, charging your phone overnight isn't recommended, as it may lead to overcharging in the long run. 14. Replace an old battery: If you have been using your device for an extended period, it might be time to replace the battery. Over time, batteries degrade and cannot hold a charge as efficiently as they once did. By applying these strategies, you can effectively extend the battery life of your cell phone, reduce power consumption, and keep your device running throughout the day. Remember that it's essential to adapt these tips according to your specific device and usage patterns for the best results."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.  - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means.

Use evidence from the fact that the tide cycle regularly occurs twice per day to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"of one misses the surf tide in the morning, will they get another chance?\\" Options are:  -they have zero chance  -they are still in luck  -it is too late  -all of these","output":"They are still in luck. The tide cycle occurs twice per day due to the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun. Tides are created by the differential gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on Earth's surface. The gravitational forces cause the ocean to bulge on the side that faces the moon and the opposite side, which results in two high tides and two low tides each day. This phenomenon is known as a semidiurnal tidal cycle. When one misses the surf tide in the morning, they still have a chance to catch it later in the day as the tide will occur again, approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes later. This is because the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to complete one orbit around the Earth, and thus, it takes that much time for the same tidal phase (e.g., high tide or low tide) to recur at a specific location. Therefore, if someone misses the surf tide in the morning, they will have another opportunity to surf during the subsequent tide cycle later in the day, meaning they are still in luck. Additionally, factors such as the shape of the coastline, local bathymetry, and the location of the sun can affect the exact timing, height, and duration of the tides. Surf conditions can also be influenced by weather and swell, which are separate from tidal forces. However, as the tide cycles are regular and predictable, missing the morning surf tide will not eliminate the chance of catching a surfable tide later in the day. In conclusion, if one misses the surf tide in the morning, they are still in luck, as the regular and predictable nature of the twice-daily tide cycle will provide another opportunity to surf during the later tide cycle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process:  - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less rain that year happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER ravines forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The formation of ravines is a continuous process that primarily depends on the interactions between water flow (mostly from streams or rivers) and the erosion of soil and bedrock. The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves a situation with less rain in a particular year. This change in precipitation can indeed have an effect on the formation of more or larger ravines, both directly and indirectly. Direct effects: 1. Reduced water flow: Less rain in a specific year means that the streams or rivers responsible for erosion might experience a reduced flow of water. A lower volume of flowing water could potentially slow down the rate of erosion, affecting the formation of new ravines or the enlargement of existing ones. 2. Lowered erosion rates: Since the rate of erosion directly depends on the force exerted by water, reduced precipitation results in a lower erosive capacity. Consequently, the rate at which ravines form or expand will most likely decrease. Indirect effects: 1. Vegetation growth: Less rain can lead to lower soil moisture and might affect the survival or distribution of vegetation in the area. Vegetation can play a role in stabilizing soil, preventing erosion. In situations with reduced rainfall, it is conceivable that some vegetation might struggle to grow, which could potentially increase soil erosion and counterintuitively promote ravine formation in certain areas. 2. Changes to the watershed: Reduced rainfall might also impact the overall structure of the watershed in which streams or rivers flow. This could lead to changes in water flow patterns and subsequently alter the spatial distribution of erosion, possibly affecting the creation or development of ravines. In summary, a reduction in annual rainfall can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of more or larger ravines. Directly, through diminished water flow and erosion rates, it might slow ravine formation or enlargement. Indirectly, it may influence factors like vegetation growth and watershed structures, which can also affect erosion and, subsequently, ravine development. Overall, the impact of less rainfall on ravine formation depends on the balance between these various direct and indirect effects and may vary depending on the specific landscape and ecosystem involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The last bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt.   Q: What process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence involves closing of the skull?   Choices:  - incubation  - elongation  - calcification  - ossification  A: Answer:","output":"ossification Intramembranous ossification is the process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence, which involves the closing of the skull. This process is the formation of bone tissue from connective tissue, specifically occurring in flat bones such as the bones of the skull, clavicles, and face. At birth, the skull and clavicles are not entirely ossified, and the sutures of the skull are not closed, allowing the skull and shoulders to deform during passage through the birth canal. The ossification process ultimately leads to the development and growth of the skull, closing the sutures as the child matures.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - Arne Johansen ( 3 April 1927 -- 25 October 2013 ) was a Norwegian speed skater and Olympic medalist .

He was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1988.  - Cortina d'Ampezzo (Ladin: \\"Anpezo, Ampëz\\"), commonly referred to as Cortina, is a town and \\"comune\\" in the heart of the southern (Dolomitic) Alps in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd.  - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).  - The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.  - The 1952 Winter Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL 1952\\"), officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"VIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), took place in Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February. Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games, but World War II made that impossible. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events, which were held at Norefjell, from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries, along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches, creating the first modern athlete's village. The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated.    What object entity has the relation of 'sport' with the subject 'arne johansen'?

Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Happiness: Cultivating Positivity in Daily Life Introduction The pursuit of happiness is a universal desire shared by individuals all around the world. Although the term 'happiness' may differ from culture to culture and person to person, it is ultimately about living an optimistic and fulfilled life. While external factors may seem like the driving force behind one's happiness, it is important to recognize the power of individual thoughts and habits in cultivating a positive outlook. In this article, we will delve into various practices, including creating happy memories, focusing on the bright side, practicing gratitude, and maintaining optimism in challenging situations, that can significantly improve one's overall happiness and well-being. 1. Create Happy Memories Memories are the building blocks of our lives, influencing our current emotions and shaping our future attitudes. Making an effort to create happy memories, as well as recalling and cherishing them, can be a powerful way to enrich one's happiness. Here are a few tips to help you create and recall happy memories:   * Engage in activities that bring joy: Seek out and participate in hobbies, outings, and social engagements that make you feel good.   * Document the good times: Capture special moments through photos, journaling, or even creating a memory jar to store positive notes from each day.   * Reminisce with loved ones: Share happy memories with family and friends, as the act of storytelling can reinforce the positive emotions associated with the experiences. 2. Look on the Bright Side A key element of happiness is the ability to maintain a positive outlook on life. This involves striving to see the silver lining in difficult situations and focusing on the aspects of life that bring joy. Here are some strategies for maintaining a positive frame of mind:   * Reframe negative thoughts: Whenever you catch yourself dwelling on the negative, make a conscious effort to shift your focus to the potential positive outcomes or learning experiences that may arise from the situation.   * Surround yourself with positivity: Spend time with people who uplift you and engage in activities that bring about a sense of happiness and fulfillment.   * Be proactive in problem-solving: Instead of simply dwelling on challenges, take a proactive approach to seeking solutions and developing coping strategies. This can boost your confidence and help to prevent feelings of helplessness. 3. Practice Gratitude Being grateful for what we have is a well-documented aspect of happiness. Practicing gratitude consistently can help to shift one's focus away from what is lacking and towards the abundance that exists in life. Some techniques for practicing gratitude include:   * Maintaining a gratitude journal: Make a habit of writing down the things for which you are grateful each day, no matter how small.   * Expressing gratitude to others: Take the time to thank the people in your life who bring you happiness or provide support during difficult times.   * Engaging in mindfulness: Develop a habit of practicing mindfulness meditation to cultivate an attitude of gratitude and deepen your appreciation for life's simple pleasures. 4. Continue Optimism When Life is Hard One of the greatest tests of happiness is how we cope during times of hardship. Remaining optimistic may seem challenging, but it can be a powerful tool for resilience and overcoming adversity. Here are some tactics for maintaining optimism in tough times:   * Remember past triumphs: Reflecting on previous challenges you have successfully overcome can provide the motivation and confidence needed to face current difficulties.   * Focus on the bigger picture: When faced with a setback, remind yourself of your long-term goals and the progress you have made towards achieving them. This can help maintain perspective and minimize the impact of temporary setbacks.   * Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or professionals for guidance and encouragement during difficult times. Don't be afraid to ask for help and lean on your support network. Conclusion Ultimately, the key to cultivating happiness lies in the way we approach life and the mental habits we establish. By actively creating happy memories, maintaining a positive outlook, practicing gratitude, and being resilient during difficult times, we can significantly enhance our overall happiness and well-being. Take small steps each day to incorporate these practices into your daily routine, and you may find that the elusive concept of happiness becomes more attainable than ever before."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a detailed answer to the question: Before hosting a dinner party to show off their new house, Remy needs to take several steps to ensure the event goes smoothly and their guests have a great time. These steps include: 1. Planning the guest list: Remy should decide how many people they would like to invite and whether they want a small, intimate gathering or a larger party. 2. Sending out invitations: Remy needs to send out invitations, either through email, phone calls, or mailing physical invitations, giving guests enough time to RSVP and plan accordingly. 3. Planning the menu: Remy should decide on a menu that includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts that cater to their guests' dietary preferences and restrictions. 4. Shopping for groceries and supplies: Remy needs to purchase all the necessary ingredients, beverages, and supplies for the dinner party, ensuring there is enough food and drink for all attendees. 5. Deep cleaning the house: Remy should clean their new home thoroughly, paying special attention to the common areas like the living room, dining room, and kitchen, as well as the restrooms. 6. Setting up the dining table and seating: Remy needs to arrange the dining table with appropriate table settings, including tablecloths, napkins, silverware, glasses, and any necessary condiment stations. They should also ensure there is enough seating for all guests. 7. Preparing the food: Remy needs to cook the planned dishes, either the day of or the day before the dinner party, ensuring that the food is fresh and properly prepared. 8. Setting the mood: Remy can enhance the ambiance by choosing appropriate background music, lighting candles, and adjusting the lighting to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. 9. Preparing a house tour: Since the purpose of this gathering is to show off their new house, Remy needs to plan a guided tour for their guests, highlighting the features and design elements they are most proud of. 10. Having a backup plan: Remy should be prepared for unexpected situations, such as guests arriving late or last-minute cancellations. Having a flexible mindset and being ready to adapt to changes will help ensure a successful dinner party. In conclusion, visiting their friend's new home does not play a role in Remy's preparations for hosting a dinner party to show off their own new house. Instead, focusing on planning, organizing, and executing a well-thought-out event will ensure Remy's dinner party is a success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eldrick Tont Woods (born December 30, 1975) better known as Tiger Woods, is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \\"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.  A related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003-04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \\"superstar\\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.  Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \\"Tiger-Proofing\\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win. What does tiger-proofing refer to?","output":"Tiger-proofing refers to the strategy adopted by many golf courses in the PGA Tour rotation, including major championship sites like Augusta National, to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Tiger Woods. This strategy involves adding yardage to their tees, making it more challenging for players with exceptionally long drives. The term \\"Tiger-Proofing\\" was coined due to Woods' dominant impact on the sport and how his sheer power and skill compelled golf course designers to modify their courses in an attempt to level the playing field for other competitors. Despite the changes, Woods mentioned that he welcomed the modifications as they did not affect his ability to win."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the people who died at the palace? is inside the article: Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the full names of the people who died at the palace are: 1. João VI (King John VI of Portugal) 2.

Most recently, I sent a package to some friends in England.  Over a month had gone by and they still hadn't received the shipment.  One day, a box showed up at our door.  It was the box that we had sent out about 5 weeks prior, except it had no contents.  The box looked as though it had been ripped open and the books that I had sent to their children were missing.

They told me they didn't know what happened, and despite the message on the package saying it had made it to Los Angeles, they told me it never actually left Las Vegas (according to their report they printed over the computer).  The manager asked me to fill out a form (I would not be reimbursed for the box they made me buy to ship the books because they told me I could reuse it - despite the box being torn open).

He, newsboy from the lower East Side of New York, who had never been farther from it than Coney Island, riding in a brilliantly lighted Pullman coach on his way into the great woods of which he had dreamed so much since he became a Scout, and of which he had only the vaguest idea! It couldn't be.  And yet it was. The roar of the wheels told him that it was. The very feel of the luxurious seat in which he was sitting told him that it was. And to clinch the fact and at the same time make it harder to believe there were his three companions, Upton, his patrol leader, Harrison and Pat Malone, whom he had secretly made his hero. Yes, it was all true, and yet he couldn't get rid of the idea that sooner or later he would wake up and find it all a beautiful dream.  The fact is, this trip was in the nature of a Christmas present. From their first meeting Pat had taken a great fancy to the street gamin. He recognized a kindred spirit. Instinctively he realized that the difference between Sparrer and himself at the same age was mainly one of environment. The youngster's sturdy independence and self-reliance, his quick wit, even his impudence, struck responsive chords in the young woodsman.

Title: Guns & Talks Movie plot: In the middle of downtown Seoul, mysterious bombings and murders are taking place. Four men leave a crime scene, skillfully evading the police. This eccentric band of killers consists of team leader Sang-yeon (Shin Hyun-joon), bomb specialist Jung-woo (Shin Ha-kyun), sniper Jae-young (Jung Jae-young), and computer hacker Ha-yoon (Won Bin). These hitmen believe they're doing a vital job in society, just like any other profession. They run a private business where people from all walks of life come to them and place an order. After they meet their clients and discuss the time, place and method by which they want their targets to be eliminated, they sign a formal contract. They even have a discount rate for students. When the deal is done, they carry out their mission and finish it like a typical day at work. The four live and work together in mundane harmony, eating Ha-yoon's bad cooking and watching their crush (Go Eun-mi) read the news on TV. One day, a persistent high school girl (Gong Hyo-jin) shows up at their door and keeps trying to hire them, while Jung-woo falls for his target, a pregnant woman (Oh Seung-hyun). Then Sang-yeon gets approached for a big job he can't turn down, one far riskier than what they're used to. The client wants someone killed in the middle of a sold-out Hamlet play with high-profile businessmen, politicians and law officers in attendance. Meanwhile, the determined and intelligent prosecutor Jo (Jung Jin-young) is on to them, and mobilizes the police force to catch them in the act.

Next question: when is spain's running of the bulls?","output":"The Running of the Bulls, also known as \\"Encierro\\" in Spanish, is a significant event held annually in Pamplona, Spain, as part of the San Fermin Festival. The festival takes place from July 6th to July 14th each year, with the Running of the Bulls itself occurring on eight consecutive days, starting from July 7th until July 14th. The San Fermin Festival (Fiesta de San Fermín), celebrated in honor of Saint Fermin, the co-patron of Navarre, dates back to the 13th century. The festivities kick off at noon on July 6th, with the launching of a firecracker known as \\"Chupinazo,\\" which marks the commencement of the non-stop party atmosphere. The Running of the Bulls, the most iconic event of the festival, takes place in the medieval streets of Pamplona. It starts at 8 am sharp on each of the eight days. The route is approximately 930 yards (850 meters) long, with the bulls running from the Santo Domingo corrals, crossing through the narrow streets of the old town, and finally entering the bullring, where a bullfight takes place later in the day. Participants, commonly wearing traditional white clothing with red bandanas around the waist and neck, run alongside the bulls, attempting to avoid being gored or trampled. This adrenaline-pumping tradition has evolved over time from the necessity to move the bulls from the countryside to the bullring for bullfighting events. Today, it serves not only as an exciting spectacle for tourists but also as a spiritual experience for some participants, who have been running with the bulls for generations. Aside from the Running of the Bulls, the San Fermin Festival also offers a variety of cultural, gastronomic, and musical events, giving locals and visitors a unique experience where traditions and entertainment come together. However, it is crucial to note that safety has always been a significant concern for the Running of the Bulls, and numerous injuries and fatalities have occurred over the years. For this reason, attendees and participants are advised to take necessary precautions and adhere strictly to the established rules to avoid any severe accidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was expecting a great western but got nudity and female mutilation in the first 5 minutes. The trash is where it went and where it belongs. What a disappointment. Answer: Answer:","output":"No. After carefully analyzing the provided review, it is evident that the user was extremely disappointed with the product they purchased. Their expectations of a great western were not met, and they were distressed by the content in the first five minutes, specifically mentioning nudity and female mutilation. Given their reaction and the fact that they threw the product in the trash, it can be confidently concluded that they would not recommend this product to others. The reviewer's dissatisfaction is clear, and their actions - discarding the product in the trash - further demonstrate their discontent. It is not unusual for potential buyers to rely on the experiences and opinions of others who have used the products they are interested in. In this case, the disappointment expressed by the reviewer would likely deter other potential buyers from purchasing the same product, especially if those potential buyers share the same values and expectations as the reviewer. Additionally, the inclusion of distressing content in the first five minutes might be perceived as an indication of the overall tone and theme of the product. Some users might be disappointed, as the reviewer was, that the product contains explicit material instead of focusing on the aspects that the user found appealing, such as the western genre. In summary, the experiences and opinions expressed in the review indicate that the user would not recommend the product to others. Their disappointment and frustration, combined with their vocal distaste for the presence of graphic content so early in the product, suggest that they would want to warn potential buyers against making the same mistake they did.

Given the question: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group.

Gennady Golovkin was born on April 8, 1982, in the city of Karaganda in the Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union (now Karagandy, Kazakhstan) to a Russian coal miner and Korean mother, who worked as an assistant in a chemical laboratory. He has three brothers, two elder named Sergey and Vadim and a twin, Max. Sergey and Vadim had encouraged Golovkin to start boxing when Golovkin was eight years old. As a youth, Golovkin would walk the streets with them, who went around picking fights for him with grown men. After ending his amateur career in 2005, Golovkin signed a professional deal with the Universum Box-Promotion (UBP) and made his professional debut in May 2006. By the end of 2008, Golovkin's record stood at 14-0 (11 KO) and while he had few wins over boxers regarded as legitimate contenders, he was regarded as one of the best prospects in the world. Golovkin was given 4 more relatively easy bouts in 2009. In 2010, Universum started to run into financial issues after having been dropped by German television channel ZDF. This caused a number of issues for Golovkin who was effectively unable to fight in Germany, and contract disputes between the two parties got complicated.  Golovkin terminated his contract with Universum in January 2010 and stated the following in an interview: \\"The reason for this decision is that I've always been placed behind Felix Sturm and Sebastian Zbik by Universum. Our demands to fight against Felix Sturm or Sebastian Zbik have been always rejected on absurd grounds. Universum had no real plan or concept for me, they did not even try to bring my career forward. They would rather try to prevent me from winning a title as long as Sturm and Zbik are champions. Further more, bouts against well-known and interesting opponents were held out in prospect, but nothing happened. This situation was not acceptable. It was time to move forward.\\"  After cutting ties with Universum, the WBA issued an interim title fight between Golovkin, ranked #1 at the time, and Milton Nunez. Golovkin routed Nunez, defeating him in 58 seconds to become a world champion. Golovkin was promptly upgraded to WBA (Regular) champion. He tried to fight WBA (Super) champion Felix Sturm and Hassan N'Dam N'Jikam during this time, but was unable to get them in the ring. Oleg Hermann, Golovkin's manager, said \\"It is very hard to find a good opponent. Everybody knows that Felix Sturm is afraid of Gennady.

A man who was shot dead in an apparent road rage incident in Pennsylvania last Saturday made multiple calls to 911 as he was pursued by a crazed driver in a dark-colored pickup, police have revealed this weekend. Timothy Davison, 28, was driving from Florida home to Maine along Interstate 81 when the shooting occurred in Antrim Township. He told 911 in several calls in Maryland and Pennsylvania that he was being chased by an enraged driver who was very aggressive. Police have concluded that a 28-year-old Timothy 'Asti' Davison (pictured) was killed in a seemingly random act of road rage last Sunday in Pennsylvania. Driven off the road: Timothy Davison was run off the road by an enraged motorist and shot dead. Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead. Police believe the shooter pursued Davison for up to 15 miles before he was run off the road onto a median strip and shot several times. Officials say the shooter was driving a dark Ford Ranger XLT pickup and are asking local mechanics to look out for a car fitting that description with damage to its driver's side as well as silver paint from Davison's car. Saluted: Fellow officers gathered from multiple states to attend the June 2013 funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky officer Jason Ellis, whose murder remains unsolved. As Davison called 911 in Northern Maryland to report the rage-filled motorist, he was being shot at by the trailing vehicle. The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania. According to police, Davison was forced into a median, disabling his vehicle, before the assailant approached and fired several rounds at him. 'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald. Police are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Hicks said that Davison indicated that a driving issue - like one person cutting another off or braking suddenly - may have sparked the problem. The only clues that the investigators, who have been joined by FBI teams, are basing their investigation on are grainy surveillance footage and bullet remnants. Search is on: The killer's car will have damage on the driver's side and silver paint from Timothy Davison's car. Crime scene: Davison's attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland, as Davison was driving home to Maine after visiting family in Florida. State police are searching for a Ford Ranger-style pickup. They say the vehicle may be blue and may have damage to the driver's side. They say Davison, who was from Poland, Maine, died at a York hospital following the 2.10am attack. Police say the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland. 'I just hope this doesnâ€™t happen to. anyone else. This wasnâ€™t just road rage.

A band typically consists of various members who specialize in different instruments or provide vocals.

In this context, the hypothesis seems to be talking about individuals being on stage. Analyzing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that the premise indeed involves a group of musicians, which are people, performing on a stage. The premise gives us enough information to infer that people are present on the stage since a band is made up of individuals. Therefore, we can conclude that if the premise is true, i.e., \\"A band performing on a stage,\\" then the hypothesis, \\"People are on stage,\\" is also true. The presence of a band on the stage essentially implies that there are people on the stage who are performing as part of that band.

This includes a few times at their La Jolla restaurant.  We dined last weekend on the 13th and came early at 5pm as they had over 200 people coming to dine that evening.  While we like to dine in their Bar, we opted for the dining room as we had guests. A waiter (Frank?) immediately checked in and my wife asked him to overview V's offerings. First mistake.  He waxed poetically about anything he could on the wine list and sizable menu and never once did any discovery with us about what we might be interested in.  This should be Rule #1 in Sales!!!  For instance, he detailed all the beef highlights (we do not eat meat) as we actually came there for the seafood. Talk about pre mature advocation.  He also mentioned that they had been working on quality control at their La Jolla restaurant as we had seen quality all over the board there as well. \\"Not here in Scottsdale though\\"  We ended up changing tables as he was non stop, left us feeling uncomfortable knowing he was lurking.  One has to wonder why he has been at sooo many Valley restaurants.  Yet the morale of this story is that V's quality may not fit either the high end ambiance or the pricing.  The Lobster Taco appetizer used to be amazing here and that night this was rubbery and the portion (for 18.00) has turned sadly smallish.  A side of beets had to be returned as these seem liked they may have been pre cooked and then put in a microwave. Chewy at best.  Of course, the Staff can always be a huge asset and the Team concept of service was exemplary.  Yet one has to wonder if  V's quality blips are Companywide in as much as La Jolla had/has issues.  They are big in Texas and we have not yet dined there.  In the end, it's summer here and V's can rock on any given night, yet quality issues will always trump the \\"sizzle\\" of  an establishment over time.  They will surely figure this out and we will return next month for a nice night.  We will just avoid Mr. pre mature advocator, that's all!!","output":"The following review is mixed with both positive and negative aspects.  Positive aspects:  1. The reviewer is a loyal customer who has dined at V's multiple times in different locations. 2. They mention the high-end ambiance of the restaurant. 3. The staff and team concept of service were praised as exemplary. Negative aspects:  1. The waiter's lack of discovery and understanding of the guests' interests, leading to an inappropriate overview of V's offerings. 2. The waiter's excessive talking made the guests feel uncomfortable. 3. Quality issues with the food, such as rubbery Lobster Taco appetizer with reduced portion size and chewy pre-cooked beets. 4. The reviewer has observed quality inconsistencies in the La Jolla restaurant as well. Despite the negative experiences, the reviewer expresses optimism that the quality issues will be resolved, and they plan to return to the restaurant next month, avoiding the mentioned waiter."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a passage, write a short incorrect summary based on the passage. the good news came the other day in the form of a phone call .

Q: The sweet taste of cold and wood smoke hung in the air. Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less aluminum formed into ingots happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If less aluminum is formed into ingots, it could potentially affect the recycling process and the production of more aluminum cans. This perturbation may have a direct or indirect effect on the process, depending on the specific cause for the reduction in ingot formation. Below are some possible effects: 1. (Direct effect) Reduced production capacity: If the recycling facility responsible for melting aluminum and forming it into ingots is operating at a reduced capacity, there will be fewer ingots available for manufacturing new aluminum products, including cans. This could cause a bottleneck in the recycling process and ultimately lead to a decrease in the number of aluminum cans being recycled and manufactured. 2. (Direct effect) Lower quality ingots: If the quality of the ingots is compromised, they might not meet the standards needed for manufacturing new aluminum products. Poor quality ingots could lead to a reduction in the production of aluminum cans, thus affecting the recycling process. 3. (Indirect effect) Higher production costs: In cases where fewer aluminum ingots are available for manufacturing, the overall cost of producing aluminum cans and other products from recycled material might increase. Higher production costs could discourage the use of recycled aluminum, and companies might opt for other alternatives, which would have a negative impact on aluminum recycling. 4. (Indirect effect) Resource limitations: If there is a reduction in the availability of aluminum ingots due to limited resources such as energy, labor, or machinery, this could inhibit ingot production and ultimately affect the recycling of aluminum cans. In conclusion, the perturbation of having less aluminum formed into ingots could have a direct or indirect effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. The specific impact will depend on the underlying causes for the reduction in ingot formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Read each problem carefully. Use pencil and paper while you study. Work out extra problems. Focus on concepts, not formulas. Article:","output":"Title: Effective Strategies for Mastering Mathematical Concepts Introduction As a cornerstone of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, mathematics is a critical subject that touches various aspects of everyday life. It enables us to solve real-world problems and make informed decisions. Yet, many students find themselves struggling to grasp mathematical concepts and perform well at different academic levels. This article outlines strategies on how students can effectively understand and retain mathematical knowledge, ultimately helping them excel in the subject. 1. Read Each Problem Carefully The first step in mastering mathematical concepts is to thoroughly read and understand each problem. Difficulties often arise when students skim through problems or fail to comprehend the question's requirements. Hence, students should take their time to examine a problem from all angles and be mindful of any specific conditions, constraints, or assumptions. Further, by dissecting each question and identifying its core components, students can develop a clear understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. 2. Use Pencil and Paper While Studying In our digital age, it is tempting to rely on online tools and calculators. However, it is essential to hone one's manual problem-solving skills by using a pencil and paper. Engaging in this traditional approach allows students to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Moreover, when students write down each problem-solving step, it helps them identify gaps in understanding and trace their thought processes. Consequently, students are better equipped to learn from their mistakes, develop critical thinking skills, and gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. 3. Work Out Extra Problems Practicing a sufficient number of problems is crucial to familiarize oneself with various question formats and types. Tackling additional problems provides students with extensive hands-on experience in applying mathematical concepts to solve real-life scenarios.  To maximize learning benefits, students should seek out diverse resources, including textbooks, online portals, and expert guidance. Joining study groups, forums, or seeking help from teachers and tutors can provide students with additional problem sets and valuable feedback on their performance. Working on a variety of problems will not only build confidence but also reveal common pitfalls and misconceptions, ensuring a solid foundation in the subject. 4. Focus on Concepts, Not Formulas While formulas are undoubtedly an essential part of mathematics, they shouldn't be the sole focus. Relying solely on memorizing formulas leaves students vulnerable to forgetting them during exams and, more importantly, lacking understanding in the underlying principles. Instead, students should strive to comprehend the underlying concepts and appreciate the relationships between different components. This deeper understanding ensures that students can apply their knowledge to new and unfamiliar problems, rather than merely reproducing solutions to rehearsed problems. When faced with challenging questions, students with a strong conceptual foundation can adapt their approach, linking ideas together and deriving the required formula rather than repeatedly searching for a predetermined answer. Conclusion Mastering mathematical concepts requires a combination of persistence, diligence, and the right learning strategies. By reading problems carefully, using pencil and paper, working out extra problems, and emphasizing conceptual understanding over formula memorization, students can unlock their potential in mathematics. These strategies not only enable students to excel academically but also prepare them for real-world problem-solving and critical thinking scenarios that will serve them well beyond the classroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. What is probably true about Puskas? - He hates army life - not enough information - He's a good father - He likes soccer","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas enjoys army life, is a good father, and holds an interest in soccer. Since he's taking part in his fourth tour in Korea and lives in the army installation with his family, it indicates a certain level of contentment and dedication to the army life. The fact that this assignment has led him to establishing a family with his Korean wife Mi-jung, and raising his children much of their lives at military bases in Korea also points to his acceptance and likely enjoyment of his army lifestyle. In terms of Puskas being a good father, there are many elements within the text that highlight this aspect. His consistent presence at his daughters' high school soccer games shows his dedication to supporting his children in their extra-curricular activities. Additionally, the emphasis on maintaining a typical family life - going to church and engaging in activities such as spending time on the soccer field in the afternoons or going for bike rides, similar to what they'd do if they were living in the States - also demonstrate his commitment to family bonding, thus portraying him as a caring and involved father. Moreover, Puskas' interest in soccer is also apparent, as he makes an effort to attend most of his daughters' high school soccer games and spends a lot of time on the soccer field. This could indicate that soccer constitutes a shared interest within the family, and that Puskas appreciates and enjoys the sport. However, stating definitively that he 'likes' soccer may be an oversimplification, as his involvement could also be driven by the desire to share in his daughters' interests. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence to support the idea that he has some level of enjoyment or appreciation for soccer.  Therefore, the assertions that 'he hates army life' and 'not enough information' can be effectively ruled out based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Before you can explain to others what the parts of speech are, it is good to brush up on them yourself. Knowing the parts of speech can help clarify grammar lessons, increase understanding from students, and improve your own writing. It is best to start with the four basic parts of speech. These are the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.   Noun: a person, place, thing, or idea.   A noun can be common (a general object) or proper (the name of a person or place).  For example, dog and goodness are common nouns while Rhode Island and Joe are proper nouns.  Verb:  a word that shows action or state of being.  For example, run, jump, sit, learn are actions that a subject can do.  Adjective:  a word that describes a noun or a pronoun. For example, pretty, large, beautiful, and loud are all adjectives.  Adverb:  a word that describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs usually end in -ly, but not always.   For example, quickly and carefully are adverbs that modify verbs while very is an adverb that modifies adjectives and other adverbs. As your lessons develop, you can start introducing the more complex parts of the speech. Pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions are a good intermediate step, as they have a clear function in the sentence and they interact with the basic parts of speech.   Pronoun: a word that takes the place of a noun. The most common type are person pronouns. Personal pronouns include: I, me, you, we, he, she, it, and they. There are many different kinds of pronouns besides the personal. They include indefinite, interrogative, reflexive, intensive, relative, and others.  Preposition: a word that describes the position of an object. For example, in, on, under, over, beside are all prepositions.  A preposition begins a prepositional phrase.  Conjunctions: words that join words, phrases, or clauses. The most common are the coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, nor, for, yet, and therefore) and subordinating conjunctions, which are those words that join dependent clauses to main clauses in complex sentences (since, when, where, if, although, etc.). Interjections and determiners can be difficult to teach and to learn because their function in the sentence is often ambiguous. Without a strong basis in the other parts of speech, learners might struggle with identifying these parts, and you might find it difficult to explain them. Save your lessons on these parts for last.   Interjections: words that are used to express an emotion like surprise or shock or disappointment. They are words that are thrust into the midst of the sentence (hence, interjected).  Determiners: the first words in noun phrases that act in a way that limits or quantifies the noun. Articles such as “a/an” and “the” as well as words like many, some, or two are what “determines” if the noun is specific or general. With eight differently colored pens or markers, underline, circle, or box every part of speech. Tell your students which color marker corresponds to which part of speech. For the rest of the lesson, whenever you underline that part of speech, use the same color. Once you are finished teaching the lesson, give your students a short passage to read. Ask them to underline each part of speech using the same corresponding colors as you did. For nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, you can encourage students to ask certain questions to help them understand what the different parts of speech are. These questions will encourage them to think about how each part functions in the sentence as well as give them an easy tool for identifying the parts of speech.  Nouns answer the questions “who?” and “what?”  Adjectives answer the questions \\"what kind?”; \\"which?\\"; and \\"how many?\\"  Verbs answer the question “what is it doing?” Adverbs answer the questions “how?”; “when?”; “where?”; and “why?” For the more difficult parts of speech—such as pronouns, conjunctions, interjections, and conjunctions—it may be easier to make a chart of the most common examples of these parts of speech. Explain these parts of speech, pointing to these examples on the chart. After the student has learned them, try asking them to make their own chart from memory. Diagramming sentences is a traditional method of explaining the parts of speech. In a sentence diagram, the parts are visualized on a series of connecting lines to show how the parts of speech relate to one another.  On a horizontal line, write the noun subject and verb of the sentence. Divide these with a vertical line. Using diagonal lines, connect adjectives and determiners to the noun that they modify and adverbs to the verb or adjective that they modify. Use dotted lines to link conjunctions with the words that they connect. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about teaching and understanding the parts of speech in English grammar. It begins with the four basic parts of speech - nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs - and provides definitions and examples for each. The article then goes on to introduce more complex parts of speech, such as pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions, again providing definitions and examples. It also briefly touches upon interjections and determiners. To help teach these concepts, the article suggests using colored pens or markers to visually represent each part of speech, asking specific questions related to each part's function, creating charts to memorize examples, and using sentence diagrams to show the relationships between the different parts of speech."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was a bitterly cold and windy winter morning when Emily, the woman in question, gazed outside her window and shivered at the sight of snowflakes swiftly falling to the ground. The streets were covered in a white blanket, and it was no secret that the day ahead would be colder than most. She knew that she had to dress warmly to brave the freezing weather, but she was always quite particular about her wardrobe. Emily opened her closet and stared at the two pieces of clothing she had laid out before her, her choices narrowed down to either the turtleneck or the scarf. The soft, black turtleneck was not only thick and knitted but was known to provide her with an ample amount of warmth during winter. Meanwhile, her favorite red scarf, adorned with intricate patterns and tassels, was lighter and far less effective at keeping the bitter cold at bay. However, as she weighed her options, a negative memory surfaced, reminding her of the last time she wore the turtleneck. It left her feeling suffocated and constricted around her neck, ultimately resulting in an itch that seemed to go on for hours. Although she couldn't quite remember when she had first recognized this discomfort, it had now become a deeply ingrained sensation, one she couldn't shake off every time she saw the turtleneck. On the other hand, the scarf had been her trusty companion for years. Its bright shade of red provided a pop of color on dreary winter days, and it was easily adjustable, allowing her to wrap it around her neck in various ways. Despite its shortcomings in providing adequate warmth and protection from the cold, it was an accessory that she genuinely enjoyed wearing. Taking a deep breath, Emily reached out for the scarf and wrapped it around her neck, admiring the way the red threads complemented her outfit. The turtleneck remained untouched, left to observe her choice from its spot in the wardrobe. As she stepped out of her home, the cold air gently brushed against her face. Emily pulled her scarf a little tighter and felt a renewed sense of appreciation for the freedom of movement it allowed. Although her neck was not as protected as it would have been with the turtleneck, she found comfort in knowing that she had chosen something that made her feel content and comfortable. Throughout the day, Emily received numerous compliments on her scarf, expressing admiration for her braving the cold with grace and style. Inwardly, she knew she had made the right choice, even though it meant making a slight compromise on warmth. This decision cemented her belief in valuing her own comfort and personal preference, fortifying her resolve to trust herself and follow her instincts when faced with future decisions. As she returned home that evening, Emily smiled softly at the sight of her turtleneck still hanging in her closet. Perhaps she would give it another try someday when she was ready to confront that lingering discomfort once more. But for now, she was more than content with her choice to wear the scarf, an accessory that not only suited her style but also signified her courage and self-assurance in a remarkably uncertain world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: S/he will examine the infected area and take an x-ray. to determine the severity of the situation and identify the best treatment.  S/he will examine the position of the tooth to see whether it has fully or partially emerged from the gums. Your dentist will also take note of the condition of the surrounding gums. If the wisdom tooth has not yet emerged, the dentist may need to perform an x-ray to locate the tooth and identify its position. These factors will influence whether or not the tooth will need to be removed. Don’t forget your medical history. Your dentist will want to know if you’re allergic to any medication. Consult with your dentist about how much the procedure will cost. You should also ask about all the risks and benefits of the treatment, as well as any alternative treatments that may be an option. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You have the right to understand your medical care. If the wisdom tooth is about to emerge from the gums without any problems and the infection is not too severe, the dentist may be able to clear the infection by simply cleaning the area with an antiseptic solution.  The dentist will remove any infected tissue, pus, food debris or plaque from around the area. If there is an abscess on the gums, sometimes a small incision will be made to drain the pus. After the cleaning, your dentist will recommend home care for you to follow over the next few days. This might include mouth gels to bring down inflammation, antibiotics to fully clear the infection, and painkillers to relieve any pain. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin, Clindamycin, and Penicillin. One of the main causes of wisdom tooth infection is when a section of gum covering the wisdom tooth — known as the gum flap —becomes infected due to bacteria, plaque and food debris becoming trapped underneath it. If the tooth is still buried within the gums (but is positioned to emerge from the gums correctly) it is often easier to remove the infected gum flap than the tooth itself.  Your dentist might schedule a minor surgical procedure called an ‘operculectomy’, in which the soft gum tissue covering the wisdom tooth is removed.  Once removed, the area will be a lot easier to keep clean and free of plaque and bacteria, which greatly reduces the chances of the wisdom tooth becoming reinfected. Before the procedure, your dentist will numb the area with a local anesthetic. S/he will then remove the infected tissue flap using surgical scalpel blades, lasers or electrocautery methods. If you have suffered from multiple infections and your wisdom tooth shows no sign of emerging on its own, it may be necessary to have the tooth removed. Extraction may also be necessary if the infection is very severe.  Depending on the position of the tooth, the extraction will be conducted by your dentist or by an oral surgeon.  The dentist will give you a local anaesthetic and will remove the tooth.  You may be prescribed antibiotics and painkillers to prevent further infection and relieve any pain. It is essential that you follow your dentist's advice regarding good oral hygiene practices. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your dentist to inspect the gums to ensure they are healing properly. The dentist will check the positioning of the opposite wisdom tooth, in case it need to be removed also.","output":"The article describes the process of diagnosing and treating an infected wisdom tooth. A dentist will first examine the infection area, possibly using X-rays, to evaluate the tooth's position and condition of the surrounding gums. The dentist will also consider the patient's medical history and whether they have allergies to any medication. Depending on the severity of the infection and the position of the tooth, the dentist may decide on different treatment options, such as cleaning the infected area with antiseptic solution, prescribing antibiotics for full recovery, or recommending a minor surgical procedure called operculectomy, which involves removing the gum flap covering the tooth. If repeated infections occur and the infected wisdom tooth shows no signs of emerging on its own, tooth extraction may be necessary. The dentist will provide local anesthesia before the procedure and may prescribe antibiotics and painkillers afterwards to help manage pain and prevent future infections.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.  - Claude \`\` Didi '' Andrey ( born 13 June 1951 in Genève , Switzerland ) is a former Swiss footballer , who most recently managed Yverdon - Sport FC in the Challenge League .  - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas.

Rudolf Diesel had retired to his cabin aboard the SS Dresden, travelling from Belgium across the English Channel. His nightclothes were laid out on his bed, but Diesel did not change into them. The inventor of the engine that bears his name was thinking about his heavy debts and the interest payments that he couldn't afford. In his diary, that date - 29 September 1913 - was marked with an ominous \\"X\\". Before the trip, Diesel had gathered what cash he could and stuffed it into a bag, together with documents laying bare his financial mess. He gave the bag to his unsuspecting wife, with instructions not to open it until a week had passed. Diesel stepped outside his cabin, removed his coat, laid it neatly on the ship's deck, looked over the railings and jumped. Or did he? Conspiracy theorists have speculated that Diesel was assisted overboard. But who might have had an interest in the impecunious inventor's demise? Two possible candidates have been fingered. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in.

Steam supplied the power for trains and factories, but urban transport depended on horses. That autumn, equine flu brought US cities to a standstill. Grocery store shelves were bare and rubbish piled up in the streets. A city of half a million people might have 100,000 horses. Each one liberally coated the streets with 15kg of manure and 4 litres of urine every day. An affordable, reliable, small-scale engine that could replace the horse would be a godsend. The steam engine was one candidate: steam-powered cars were coming along nicely. Another was the internal combustion engine, early versions of which ran on petrol, gas, or even gunpowder. But when Rudolf Diesel was a student, both types of engine were woefully inefficient, converting only around 10% of heat into useful work. The young Diesel's life was changed by a lecture on thermodynamics at the Royal Bavarian Polytechnic of Munich, where he learned that it was theoretically possible to make an internal combustion engine that would convert all heat into work. Diesel set himself the task of translating theory into practice. He failed. His first working engine was only just over 25% efficient. Today, the best Diesel engines top 50%. But even so, 25% was more than twice as good as its rivals achieved. Diesel's engine is more efficient partly because of how it ignites the fuel. Petrol engines compress fuel and air together, then ignite it with a spark plug. But compress the mixture too much and it can self-ignite, which causes destabilising engine knock. Diesel's invention compresses only the air, and more so, making it hot enough to ignite the fuel when it's injected. And the higher the compression ratio, the less fuel is needed. Anyone who's researched buying a car will be familiar with the basic trade-off of a Diesel engine - they tend to be more expensive to buy, but more economical to run. Unfortunately for Rudolf, in early versions these efficiency gains were outweighed by reliability issues. He faced a steady stream of refund demands from unhappy customers. This dug the inventor into the financial hole from which he could not escape. Still, he kept working at his engine, and it kept improving. Other advantages became apparent. Diesel engines can use a heavier fuel than petrol engines - specifically, a heavier fuel that's become known as \\"diesel\\". As well as being cheaper than petrol to refine from crude oil, diesel also gives off fewer fumes, so it's less likely to cause explosions. This made it particularly attractive for military transport. By 1904, Diesel had got his engines into France's submarines. This brings us to the first conspiracy theory around Rudolf Diesel's death. In 1913 Europe, the drumbeats of impending war were quickening, and the cash-strapped German was en route to London. One newspaper headline luridly speculated: \\"Inventor thrown into the sea to stop sale of patents to British government.\\" It was only after World War One that Diesel's invention began to realise its commercial potential. The first diesel-powered trucks appeared in the 1920s, trains in the 1930s. By 1939 a quarter of global sea trade was fuelled by diesel. After World War Two, ever more powerful and efficient diesel engines led to ever more enormous ships. Fuel accounts for around 70% of the costs of shipping goods around the world. Scientist Vaclav Smil argues that steam-powered globalisation would have grown much more slowly than diesel allowed. The economist Brian Arthur isn't so sure. He describes the rise of the internal combustion engine over the past century as \\"path dependence\\": a self-reinforcing cycle in which existing investments and infrastructure mean we keep doing things in a certain way, even if we'd do them differently if only we could start from scratch. As late as 1914, Arthur argues, steam was at least as viable as crude oil for powering cars - but the growing influence of the oil industry ensured that much more money went into improving the internal combustion engine than the steam engine. With equal investment in research and development, perhaps today we'd be driving next-generation steam-powered cars. Alternatively, if Rudolf had had his way, perhaps the global economy would run on peanuts. Diesel's name has become synonymous with a crude oil derivative, but he designed his engine to use a variety of fuels, from coal dust to vegetable oils. In 1900, at the Paris World Fair, he demonstrated a model based on peanut oil. He became something of an evangelist and in 1912 - a year before his death - Diesel predicted that vegetable oils would become as important a source of fuel as petroleum products. A more appealing vision for owners of peanut farms than for owners of oil fields, the impetus to make it happen largely dissipated with Diesel's death. Hence the second conspiracy theory to inspire a speculatively sensationalist headline in a contemporary newspaper: \\"Murdered by agents from big oil trusts.\\" There's recently been a resurgence of interest in biodiesel. It's less polluting than oil fuel, but it's controversial - it competes for land with agriculture, pushing up food prices. In Rudolf's era, this was less of a concern: the population was much smaller, and the climate was more predictable. Diesel was excited by the idea that his engine could help to develop poor, agricultural economies. How different might the world look today, if the most valuable land during the past hundred years wasn't where you could drill for oil, but where you could cultivate peanuts? We can only guess - just as we'll never know for sure what happened to Rudolf Diesel. By the time his body reappeared 10 days later, it was too decomposed for an autopsy, or even for the crew to be willing to take it on board at all. Diesel's wallet, pocket knife and spectacles case were retrieved and later identified by his son. His body was taken by the waves.

Summary:","output":"Inventor Rudolf Diesel, responsible for the development of the diesel engine, once believed vegetable oils would be as important a source of fuel as petroleum products. In 1900, Diesel demonstrated a model at the Paris World Fair that ran on peanut oil and he designed his engine to use a variety of fuels, including vegetable oils and coal dust. However, the sector largely dissipated with Diesel’s death in 1913. A recent resurgence of interest in biodiesel has led to speculation about the differences between the diesel and petroleum industries and how the world might look today if biodiesel had gained equal traction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, on the Bengals' second possession they were able to drive deep into Denver territory, reaching the 11-yard line before setting up for a short field goal. However, the field goal snap was fumbled. After the flubbed field goal, both teams entered a period of offensive ineptness - Denver had four consecutive one-and-done drives, while Cincinnati was forced to punt, then had a promising drive end with a Carson Palmer interception after Denver cornerback Champ Bailey tipped the ball into the air and Wesley Woodyard recovered the interception. Denver was finally able to put together a drive at the end of the first half that finished with a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal as time ran out. Despite being out-gained in all offensive indicators, Denver took a 3-0 lead into halftime due to Cincinnati mistakes, including the fumbled field goal, interception, and multiple dropped passes. During the third quarter, neither team was able to sustain an offensive drive - Cincinnati punted 3 times, while Denver punted 2 times. However, Denver's defense showed improvement, including one Cincinnati drive that ended after two consecutive sacks of Carson Palmer. Denver was able to put together another field goal drive at the end of the third quarter, with Matt Prater this time kicking a 50-yard field goal to put the Broncos on top 6-0. The fourth quarter continued in much the same vein. Denver made it into field goal range again before a 5-yard penalty and 7-yard sack forced them to punt it away again. However, Cincinnati was able to put together their first sustained drive of the entire game during the second half of the quarter - the Bengals gained 90 yards on 11 plays over 5:40. This culminated with a 1-yard Cedric Benson touchdown run that avoided a Bengals shutout and put them on top for the first time. Denver regained control of the ball at their own 13-yard line with 38 seconds remaining. After an incomplete pass, Kyle Orton attempted a pass to Brandon Marshall with 28 seconds remaining. The ball was tipped into the air by Bengals defensive back Leon Hall and into the hands of Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley, who then took it untouched 87 yards to the end zone with 11 seconds remaining. Records showed that this was the longest play from scrimmage in NFL history with less than 1 minute remaining in the game. The play was referred to by some as \\"The Immaculate Deflection\\" after The Immaculate Reception. Denver took a 12-7 lead but failed a two-point conversion. A desperation hail mary pass by Carson Palmer was intercepted in the end zone with 5 seconds to play by Denver tight end Tony Scheffler.

On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\".

Options: - lie down - like heat - eating fish - drink water - come to dinner  Explain why a human would choose \\"like heat\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"like heat\\" to answer the question \\"Cats are laying by the refrigerator why do they do that?\\" for the following reasons: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The person would understand that the question is about cats' behavior and their preference for a specific location (by the refrigerator). Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options The person would then analyze each option and eliminate those that do not make sense in the context of the question: - lie down: Cats can lie down anywhere, not necessarily by the refrigerator, so this option is too general. - eating fish: There is no information about fish in the question, so this option is not relevant. - drink water: The refrigerator is not a source of water, making this option irrelevant. - come to dinner: The question does not mention anything about dinner time or food, so this option is not connected to the question. Step 3: Choose the most relevant option The person would then choose the \\"like heat\\" option, as it makes the most sense in the context of the question. Refrigerators usually emit heat from their cooling systems, making the area around them warmer. Cats are known to like warm places, which explains why they would lay there.

After being discharged from the Army in 1946, Serling worked at a rehabilitation hospital while recovering from his wounds. His knee troubled him for years. Later, his wife became accustomed to the sound of him falling down the stairs when his knee buckled under his weight.  When he was fit enough, he used the federal G.I. bill's educational benefits and disability payments to enroll in the physical education program at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He had been accepted to Antioch (his brother's alma mater) while in high school. His interests led him to the theater department and then to broadcasting. He changed his major to Literature and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950. \\"I was kind of mixed up and restless, and I kind of liked their work-for-a-term, go-to-school-for-a-term set-up,\\" he recounted.  As part of his studies, Serling became active in the campus radio station, an experience which proved useful in his future career. He wrote, directed, and acted in many radio programs on campus, then around the state, as part of his work study. Here he met Carolyn Louise \\"Carol\\" Kramer, a student, who later became his wife. At first, she refused to date him because of his campus reputation as a \\"ladies man\\", but she eventually changed her mind.
