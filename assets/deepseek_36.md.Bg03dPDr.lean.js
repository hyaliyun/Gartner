Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is understood to be the weather of Earth.  Paragraph: David was interested in climate change issues. He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which may not use average atmospheric conditions, term A or term B? The answer is:","output":"Term A may not use average atmospheric conditions. In the given paragraph, David labeled weather as term A and climate as term B. Weather refers to the day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity in a specific atmospheric area at a given time, whereas climate is defined by the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. Since term A represents weather, it is associated with short-term and individual meteorological events instead of the average atmospheric conditions. Weather phenomena typically occur in the troposphere and include elements like temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. These factors can change within minutes, hours, or days, and can lead to various local weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy. On the other hand, term B represents climate, which is mainly concerned with average atmospheric conditions over long-term periods, often spanning multiple years or even decades. Climate takes into account the persistent behavior of weather elements and patterns for a specific region. Climatologists study these long-term data sets to understand the natural variability and identify emerging trends, such as global warming and climate change. In summary, term A (weather) may not use average atmospheric conditions, as it deals with short-term fluctuations and specific meteorological events, whereas term B (climate) characterizes the long-term behavior and averages of atmospheric conditions in a given region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wilson maintains he hasn't done anything wrong, and the resignation talks have hinged on whether a grand jury returns an indictment against him in the death of Brown, people close to the talks said.      Wilson has told associates he would resign as a way to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers. Wilson has expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault.      Wilson could announce as soon as Friday his plans to resign, the same day a St. Louis County grand jury meets to deliberate and possibly decide on an indictment.

(AP) — The suburban St. Louis police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown seems confident that he will not face criminal charges from a grand jury that has been investigating the case for several months, a police union official said Thursday.      FILE - In this Feb. 11, 2014 file image from video provided by the City of Ferguson, Mo., officer Darren Wilson attends a city council meeting in Ferguson. Wilson is not expecting to face criminal charges... (Associated Press)      Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the Aug. 9 shooting that sparked tense and occasionally violent protests and drew national attention.      Wilson has been under a lot of pressure and stress but appeared confident in the outcome of the grand jury investigation, Roorda said.      \\"It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,\\" Roorda said, offering his impression of the situation based on the meeting with Wilson.      Roorda later told the AP in a text message that he was only speaking for himself.      \\"Wilson seems confident that justice will be served, but neither he nor his attorneys shared any expectations with me,\\" he said in the text.      One of Wilson's attorneys, who also attended Thursday's meeting, said there was no specific discussion of expectations.      \\"We have absolutely no idea — no more than anyone else — what may or may not happen,\\" attorney Neil Bruntrager said. \\"The only expectation that we would have is that the grand jury would be thorough and fair.\\"      If he is indicted, Wilson will immediately turn himself in to authorities, Bruntrager said.      Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.      A 12-person St. Louis County grand jury has been hearing evidence in the case as it weighs whether to issue charges against the white officer for the black 18-year-old's death. A decision could come soon, though authorities have not publicized any specific date for an announcement.      Roorda said St. Louis city police have been notified that they are switching to 12-hour shifts starting Saturday, a preparation for a potential uptick in protests.      The St. Louis County Police Department has not yet decided whether to switch to longer work shifts, spokesman Brian Schellman said.      For weeks, local and state police have been preparing for a grand jury announcement in anticipation that it will result in renewed protests. Earlier this week, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to help with security.      Authorities have said Wilson shot Brown, who was unarmed, following some sort of physical confrontation that occurred after Wilson told Brown and a friend to stop walking down the center of a street.      Wilson told authorities that the shooting happened after Brown struggled with him for his gun, according to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the New York Times that cited unnamed sources. But some witnesses have said Brown had his arms raised — as if to surrender — when the fatal shot was fired.      Riots and looting occurred a day after the shooting, and protesters filled the streets for weeks. Police responded by firing tear gas and smoke canisters into crowds of demonstrators after some people threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.      Protests have been nearly constant since the shooting. The vast majority of protesters want to see the officer charged with murder. Many are also pushing for changes in the way police and the courts interact with minorities. A handful of demonstrations have been in support of Wilson.      Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family, described the investigation as an \\"emotional roller-coaster\\" for his clients. Even if Wilson is indicted, there's no guarantee of a conviction. And if he isn't charged, Crump said Thursday, \\"they get no chance of justice for their child.\\"      Crump said he had no insight into the timing of the grand jury's decision, but that he expected to be notified ahead of any public announcement.      Wilson has incurred significant legal, medical and relocation expenses, and a police charity has raised close to 500,000 for him, Roorda said.      ___      Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.      ___      Follow David A.

Today, we are going to learn about a super cool tool called 'calipers'. Calipers help us measure different things easily and quickly. Do you want to know how to use them? Great! Let's start our exciting journey together! Step 1 - Make it Zero! Before we start measuring anything, the first thing we need to do is to make the calipers 'zero'. It helps us prepare the tool for measuring. So, how do we do that? Just press the 'zero' button (sometimes it can also be called the 'on/off' button) on your digital calipers, and that's it! Your calipers are now ready for action! Step 2 - Let's Measure the Outside! Calipers have two special parts called 'jaws'. These jaws help the calipers to hold and measure things. To measure the outside of an object, open the jaws wide and gently hold the object between the jaws (like a big hug!). Make sure the jaws touch the object on its two sides. Now, you have one part of the jaws on one side of the object and the other on the opposite side. Hold your calipers steady and check the digital reading - this is the size of your object from the outside! Step 3 - Time to Discover the Inside! Sometimes, we also need to know the size of the inside of an object. In this case, we will use the open parts of the jaws. Place these open parts inside the object, touching the inner walls. Be gentle not to press too hard! Now, again, take a look at the digital reading. This tells you the size of the object from the inside! Step 4 - Going Deep! You can also use your calipers to measure how deep something is. For this, you will need the 'extension rod,' which is a thin metal stick at the end of your calipers. Gently push the extension rod inside the part of the object you want to measure. Make sure it reaches the bottom. Once it does, take a look at the digital reading on the calipers. This will tell you the depth of your object! Now you know how to use calipers for different measurements! Good job! With practice, you'll become a caliper master in no time.

Question 1: How is the placement in CET bhubaneswar? Question 2: Can I get IT in CET Bhubaneswar with AIR 110,000? Options are:  A). no  B). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: The placement scene at the College of Engineering and Technology (CET), Bhubaneswar, is quite impressive, particularly for top-performing branches like computer science and engineering, information technology, and electronics and communication engineering. To better analyze the placement, we can look at different aspects such as its placement cell, the recruiters visiting the campus, and the salary packages offered to the students. CET Bhubaneswar has a dedicated Training and Placement Cell that is responsible for grooming the students, coordinating with industries, and arranging for internship and placement opportunities. The cell conducts career counseling, workshops, seminars, and industry interactions to refine the students' industry-readiness. They also organize pre-placement talks, in which companies provide insights into the roles and responsibilities along with various technologies and skills required to excel in different job profiles. Leading companies and organizations participate in the campus recruitment process at CET Bhubaneswar, hiring students for diverse roles across sectors. Some of the reputed recruiters include Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant, Samsung, Larsen & Toubro, Vedanta, and many others. Placement activities at the college are organized annually to help both undergraduate and postgraduate students secure suitable jobs in their respective fields. In terms of salary packages, students at CET Bhubaneswar receive offers that are on par with those at other well-known engineering colleges in the country. The average salary package usually falls between INR 3.5 lakhs to INR 6 lakhs per annum, while the highest packages can go up to INR 18-20 lakhs per annum. The final packages offered depend on the role, company, and the performance of the candidate during the selection process. Question 2: To determine whether you can get the Information Technology (IT) branch at CET Bhubaneswar with an All India Rank (AIR) of 110,000, we need to look at certain factors such as exam cut-offs, seat availability, and applicants' performance in the admission process. Cut-offs are generally determined by factors such as the number of applicants, the seat availability in a given branch, and the previous years' trends. Keeping these factors in mind and based on past trends, it can be challenging to secure a seat in the IT branch with an AIR of 110,000, as CET Bhubaneswar is a reputable engineering college with significant competition for available seats. However, it is important to remember that cut-off ranks can change from year to year, and admission processes like counseling and quota systems may influence your chance of securing a seat. Additionally, if you belong to a reserved category, you may have a higher probability due to the distinct allocation of seats for such students. Now, considering the options provided: A) No B) Yes It is more likely that the answer to the question \\"Can I get IT in CET Bhubaneswar with AIR 110,000?\\" is 'A) No,' as it can be quite challenging to secure a seat with that rank. In summary, while the placement scene in CET Bhubaneswar is impressive, securing a seat in the IT branch with an AIR of 110,000 might be difficult. Of course, various factors such as cut-offs, reservation, and seat allocation during counseling may impact your ability to secure a seat in IT. The answers to both questions, therefore, are not the same because they address different aspects of the college experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was one of the people who made Silicon Valley  the capital of technological invention. Author and business consultant Jim Collins once called Jobs the \\"Beethoven of business\\". When asked what Steve Jobs will be best remembered for, many of us would name a particular product:the iPod, the iPhone or the iPad, for example. But in the eyes of Eric Jackson, a reporter with Forbes magazine, Jobs brought the world much more than these popular devices . Here are some of the lessons he taught us: 1. The most lasting inventions mix art and science. Jobs pointed out that the team members working with Apple were trained in anthropology , art, history, and poetry. He believed this was important in making Apple's products stand out. 2. Never fear failure. Jobs was fired by the successor he himself chose. It was one of the most public embarrassments  of the last 30 years in business. However, Jobs didn't hide away or try to get a new job. He _ and got back to work. 3. You can't look forward to connecting the dots--you can only look backward. This means that, however much we try to plan things ahead of time, life is always full of unexpected things. What seems like bitter pain and defeat could turn out to sow the seeds of unimaginable success in years to come. You can't connect the dots looking forward. But you have to trust that all the dots will be connected in the future. 4. Listen to that voice in tile back of your head that tells you if you're on the right track or not. Most of us simply decide that we're going to work in finance or become a doctor because it's what our parents tell us to do. Whatever your voice is telling you, it is smart to listen to it--like Jobs did. Just as Caroline and Amy from his empire put it, \\"Steve was one of the most inspiring yet toughest boss ever--but who else could have built Apple? What Steve left is sure to inspire generations of creative thinkers to think differently. His influence will be felt throughout the world.\\" What's the writer's main purpose of writing the passage?

Bryan Cadogan, mayor of the Clutha district, which includes Kaitangata, on New Zealand's South Island, says the town of 800 has more jobs than residents can fill, so it's offering brand-new houses on quarter-acre lots for 160,000 to entice people to move in; affordable housing in Auckland can cost more than twice as much, reports Radio NZ. There are about 1,000 vacant jobs in the district and many others—at a dairy processing plant, for example—are filled by workers bused in from a city more than an hour away, per the Guardian. Even youth unemployment is \\"down to two. Not 2%—just two unemployed young people,\\" Cadogan says. The jobs available—including in nursing, construction, and the military—are \\"phenomenally good\\" with starting salaries up to 35,500 per year, Cadogan tells the BBC, adding that the local bank and lawyers have teamed up to offer discounts on costs associated with buying a home.

Article: The first time Ed Currie tasted the Carolina Reaper, a fire-engine red chili pepper the size of a golf ball, “it knocked me to my knees,” he says. “I was very surprised.”      Currie, who’s the founder of the PuckerButt Pepper Company and cultivator of the Carolina Reaper, says he wasn’t trying to create the hottest pepper in the world. His initial aim was to produce a pepper packed with capsaicinoids, a family of compounds that has been used in pharmaceuticals such as arthritis creams. Currie had heard they might be useful in treating cancer or heart disease (any solid proof of this remains elusive, though Currie is optimistic).      But capsaicinoids are also what make chili peppers hot. Of those compounds, capsaicin is the most common.      Cliff Calloway, a chemistry professor at Winthrop University in South Carolina, says the capsaicin molecule looks like a key, with a round end and a tail coming out of it, and acts like one, too. “It kind of fits into these little nerve cells in your tongue,” he explains, and when that happens, you perceive the sensation of heat. “So even though it’s not really a chemical burn, like getting burned by a match or a flame or anything like that, your nerve cells get the signal from the capsaicin ‘key’ to make them think that they’re getting burned,” says Calloway.      By packing his Carolina Reaper with capsaicinoids, Currie inadvertently concocted a very, very hot pepper. “When you bite into it, the initial taste is sweet. You go, wow, that wasn’t so bad. And then immediately, that vast amount of capsaicin takes over, and it’s kind of like eating molten lava. That’s the best way to put it,” Currie says.      The heat is so bad, it feels good — Currie says Reaper consumers sometimes experience something like a runner’s high. And the cooldown can take a little while — expect about half an hour before the heat sensation dissipates. (Currie, by the way, recommends citric acid — like lemon juice — to help ice the fire.)      Currie first cultivated the Carolina Reaper in 2004, crossing a Naga pepper from Pakistan with an habanero pepper from the island of St. Vincent. Then he worked with Calloway and his students at Winthrop to test and analyze the pepper’s heat value. They used a high-performance liquid chromatography system, a chemical process that can separate the capsaicinoid compounds from other substances in the pepper.      The system is also equipped with a detector that measures the amount of UV light absorbed by each capsaicinoid. The more of a capsaicinoid there is, the more light that gets absorbed, and the greater the signal from the detector.      Based on the strength of those signals, chemists can determine the concentration of each capsaicinoid, and from there, calculate the pepper’s Scoville value — that is, its heat level.      The Scoville scale was developed by pharmacist Wilbur Scoville more than 100 years ago as a quantitative measurement for how hot chili peppers were.      “He came up with this idea to take a pepper extract and dilute it, and dilute it again and taste it, dilute it again and taste it,” over and over again, Calloway says. The factor required to dilute the solution to the point where he sensed no heat was that pepper’s Scoville number. So for example, a solution diluted by 1,000 times meant the pepper’s Scoville number was 1,000.      By the 1970s, analytical chemists modified the technique to make it less subjective and more standardized. They used gas [and later, liquid] chromatography to separate the capsaicinoids, and a set of pungency values that related capsaicinoid concentration to Scoville’s original dilution factor.      After years of testing, through various seasons and analyses of different plots and varieties, Calloway and his team concluded that the Carolina Reaper averaged a Scoville value of 1.569 million, though it could go as high as 2.2 million.      “By comparison, a jalapeño is probably 10,000 to 15,000 Scoville units,” Calloway says.      In 2013, the Guinness Book of World Records designated the Carolina Reaper as the hottest pepper in the world. And it seems to be getting hotter with each passing season, according to Currie, but he and his research colleagues don’t quite know why.      Currie says he’s not so interested in defending the hottest pepper title — he’s more keen to contribute his pepper work to medical research, if possible. But, he adds, “honestly, we have all the data ready for the next one. So if someone tries to beat me, I can knock them out.”      This story was first published by PRI's Science Friday with Ira Flatow. ||||| NEW CASTLE, Ind. -- More than two dozen New Castle students became ill Thursday after eating the hottest breed of pepper in the world.      District officials say a student brought a pepper known as a Carolina Reaper to New Castle Middle School on Thursday. After eating it, as many as 30 students began experiencing an intense burning sensation in their mouths, eyes and on their skin.      The principal called emergency responders to the school to treat the students.      The Carolina Reaper is a hybrid pepper made initially by crossbreeding a ghost pepper and a red habanero. It has rated up to 1.57 million Scoville Heat Units (the Scoville scale is used to determine how \\"hot\\" a pepper is). By comparison, a jalapeño pepper rates anywhere from 3,500-10,000 Scoville units.      None of the students were believed to have been seriously injured by eating the pepper. |||||Summary:","output":"The Carolina Reaper, a golf ball-sized chili pepper, is known as the hottest pepper in the world.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a character in a series of suspense novels by Thomas Harris. Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon as a forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal, Lecter becomes a protagonist. Throughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz (Hetienne Park), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she find evidence of his guilt; Lecter catches her, however, and kills her. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces a deranged hospital orderly (Jonathan Tucker) to try to kill Lecter, but the attempt fails. Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), a psychologist for whom Graham has romantic feelings. Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague Frederick Chilton (Raul Esparza) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and \\"influencing\\" his surviving victim Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her.  Graham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to entrap him. Lecter quickly becomes aware of the ruse, but finds the experience fascinating and allows it to continue in order to explore the connection he feels with Graham. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a serial killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier (Mark O'Brien) to kill Graham, but Graham kills and mutilates Tier instead - just as Lecter hoped he would. Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter Fredericka \\"Freddy\\" Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap.  Lecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in Mason Verger (Michael Pitt), a wealthy sadist whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle). Verger has them both kidnapped and prepares to feed them to his prize pigs; however, Lecter escapes and takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. He gives Verger a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him.  In the second-season finale, Graham and Crawford move to arrest Lecter against the orders of the FBI. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Graham and Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then cuts Abigail's throat in front of Graham and leaves them to die as he flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson).

Article: When a tornado touched down in a small town nearby, many families were left completely destroyed. Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching     at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \\" We have so much.

Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\\" I said. The boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest.

Possible A: dry mouth, whispering, being heard, eye contact, not listening  Why is \\"not listening\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Not listening\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Purpose of communication: The primary purpose of talking to someone is to convey information, share ideas, or express feelings. If the person you are talking to is not listening, this purpose is not being fulfilled. 2. Reciprocity in interaction: Communication is a two-way process that involves both speaking and listening. If one party is not listening, the interaction is not balanced, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. 3. Time and effort: Talking requires time and effort. If the other person is not listening, this time and effort are wasted, and the conversation becomes pointless. 4. Frustration and feeling disrespected: If someone is not listening, it can be frustrating and may make the speaker feel disrespected. This can negatively affect the relationship between the two people involved in the conversation. 5. Comparing to other options: Comparing \\"not listening\\" to the other possible answers (dry mouth, whispering, being heard, eye contact), \\"not listening\\" stands out as the most significant factor that would render a conversation pointless.

Write a title for this article: By Domenico Montanaro, Deputy Political Editor, NBC News The Michael Grimm story of threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony because of a question the New York Republican didn’t like has begun to take on a life of its own. It’s following an all-too-familiar pattern -- a controversy, an inadequate first response, a massive media glare, an apology, and finally the desire to move on. But this isn’t the first time a shiny-metal object -- with little-to-no political consequence, beyond perhaps hurting Grimm for his reelection -- has distracted from the substance of an address to Congress and the nation in the Obama Era. 2009: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s Republican response was lampooned as being “Kenneth the Page”-like. Later that year, Obama went before Congress to deliver an address on health care. That’s when South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson blurted out, “You Lie!” 2010: Justice Samuel Alito shakes his head at the State of the Union, mouthing “not true” at President Obama’s criticism of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. 2011: Michele Bachmann delivered the Tea Party response. In a bit of poor planning, she wound up looking at wrong camera for the television audience. She was looking at the livestream web camera for Tea Party Express, but most people were watching on broadcast and cable television. 2012: Mitch Daniels’ despair/unhopeful response lampooned by Jon Stewart. It was also a State of the Union that was delivered in the heart of the GOP primary. 2013: Marco Rubio’s water sip after the State of the Union got all the attention, but before it was Ted Nugent being in the hall as a guest of Texas Rep. Steve Stockman. 2014: Michael “Throw you off the Balcony” Grimm and before that a Duck Dynasty star being another controversial guest (as well as a handful of others).

Abe Urges G7 To Worry More About Growth, China The leaders of the world’s richest democracies voiced concern about emerging economies at a summit in Japan Thursday, as their host, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, made a pointed comparison to the 2008 global financial crisis. However, not all his guests appeared to agree. The leaders of the ‘G7’ did agree on the need for flexible spending to spur world growth but the timing and amount depended on each country, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko told reporters, adding some countries saw no need for such spending. Germany in particular has been resisting calls for fiscal stimulus, backed by Britain. “G7 leaders voiced the view that emerging economies are in a severe situation, although there were views that the current economic situation is not a crisis,” Seko said after the first day of a two-day G7 summit in Ise-Shima, central Japan. Abe presented data showing global commodities prices fell 55 percent from June 2014 to January 2016, the same margin as from July 2008 to February 2009, after the Lehman collapse. Lehman had been Wall Street’s fourth-largest investment bank when it filed for Chapter 11 protection on Sept. 15, 2008, making its bankruptcy by far the biggest in U.S. history. Its failure triggered the global financial crisis. Abe hopes, some political insiders say, to use a G7 statement on the global economy as cover for a domestic fiscal package including the possible delay of a rise in the nation’s sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent planned for next April. Obama told a news conference that he stressed the importance of pushing back against competitive currency devaluations, which some countries might be tempted to use to boost exports. Japan and the three Eurozone members of the G7 (France, Germany and Italy) have all benefited from central bank action that has directly or indirectly kept their exchange rates low in the last couple of years. Other topics at the summit include terrorism, cybersecurity and maritime security, especially China’s increasing assertiveness in the East and South China Seas. Beijing has territorial disputes with Japan and several Southeast Asian nations. G7 leaders agreed that it was important to send a clear signal on the South and East China Seas, Seko told reporters, adding that China was mentioned in discussions on maritime matters on Thursday. Over in China, though, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the South China Sea issue had “nothing to do” with the G7 or any of its member states. “China is resolutely opposed to individual countries hyping up the South China Sea for personal gain,” Hua said. Obama pointed to the threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, saying the isolated state was “hell bent” on getting atomic weapons. But he said there had been improved responses from countries in the region like China that could reduce the risk of Pyongyang selling nuclear material. Obama said G7 leaders had been rattled by some of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s statements, which he said displayed ignorance and lacking in statesmanship. On Wednesday night, Abe met Obama for talks dominated by the arrest of a U.S. military base civilian worker in connection with the killing of a young woman on Japan’s southern Okinawa island, the reluctant host to the bulk of the U.S. military in Japan. The attack has marred Obama’s hopes of keeping his Japan trip strictly focused on his visit on Friday to Hiroshima, site of the world’s first atomic bombing, to highlight reconciliation between the two former World War Two foes and his nuclear anti-proliferation agenda. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a meeting in Japan with leaders from the world's richest countries, called the G7.

They also talked about China's actions on the seas, and how other countries might be worried. Other subjects at the meeting include fighting against bad things like terrorism and keeping computers safe.

Answer the question...where did daniel and the lions den take place??","output":"The story of Daniel and the lion's den is a well-known biblical narrative that took place in the ancient kingdom of Babylon, located near present-day Baghdad, Iraq. The account appears in the Old Testament book of Daniel, specifically in chapter 6.  To provide a comprehensive understanding of the story, it is essential to examine the historical and geographical context. The kingdom of Babylon was a powerful empire in the ancient Near East, spanning from the 18th century BC to the 6th century BC. It reached the height of its power under King Nebuchadnezzar II (around 605-562 BC), before falling to the Medo-Persian Empire led by Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. The events of Daniel and the lion's den occurred during the reign of King Darius of the Medo-Persian Empire, who conquered the Babylonian Empire. The political and administrative center of the empire was Babylon, which was also a prominent cultural and religious hub. This vibrant city boasted the famous Hanging Gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Daniel, a devout Jewish man, served as a high-ranking official under both Nebuchadnezzar II and later Darius. He was renowned for his wisdom, integrity, and ability to interpret dreams and visions. Jealous of Daniel's favored position, a group of other Babylonian officials hatched a plan to eliminate him. They convinced the king to sign a decree that for the next 30 days, no one could pray to any god or human other than Darius. Violators of this decree would be thrown into a den of lions. Knowing the decree, Daniel continued to pray openly to his God, Yahweh, leading to his arrest and ultimate punishment. He was thrown into the lion's den, where miraculously, he survived the night unscathed. According to the biblical account, God sent an angel to shut the mouths of the lions, saving Daniel from a gruesome fate.  In the morning, when King Darius discovered that Daniel was alive, he was overjoyed and realized that the God of Daniel was indeed powerful and true. Consequently, the king ordered that those who had conspired against Daniel and their families be thrown into the lion's den, where they were devoured swiftly. In response to these events, Darius issued a decree that everyone in his realm should worship and revere the God of Daniel. In summary, the events of Daniel and the lion's den took place in the ancient kingdom of Babylon during the reign of King Darius of the Medo-Persian Empire. This captivating story is set against the backdrop of political intrigue, religious devotion, and divine intervention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which territory did Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fight over? Answer:","output":"Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces, also known as the Asiatic Cavalry Division, and the Transbaikal Cossacks fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during the Russian Civil War and the War of Independence in Mongolia (1917-1921).  Ungern-Sternberg was a Russian military officer and leader of the anti-Bolshevik White forces in the Russian Far East and Siberia. He was also known as the \\"Mad Baron\\" or \\"Bloody Baron\\" due to his violent and eccentric behavior. He aimed to restore the monarchy in Russia and create a unified Pan-Asian empire, with Mongolia serving as a buffer state between Soviet Russia and Japan. In 1921, Ungern-Sternberg's forces liberated the Mongolian capital city, Urga (now Ulaanbaatar), from Chinese occupation, which had been under control since 1919. This led to the reestablishment of the autonomy of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, with Ungern-Sternberg as the de facto ruler. However, Ungern-Sternberg's reign was short-lived, and his forces faced numerous challenges, including resistance from the Red Army and the Transbaikal Cossacks, local political tension, and widespread destruction. Ultimately, both Ungern-Sternberg and his Asiatic Cavalry Division were defeated by the Red Army and the Mongolian People's Army, which supported the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In summary, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal Cossacks fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia, amid the chaos of the Russian Civil War and the War of Independence in Mongolia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"These sentences have similar information but are not exactly the same in meaning. Let's analyze both sentences separately for a better understanding. Sentence 1: \\"Produced by Arthur Hammerstein the show was directed by Reginald Hammerstein (the brother of Oscar Hammerstein II) and was choreographed by Danny Dare.\\" In this sentence, the show is produced by Arthur Hammerstein. Reginald Hammerstein, Arthur's brother and also the brother of Oscar Hammerstein II, is the director of the show. The choreography of the show is done by Danny Dare. Sentence 2: \\"Produced by Oscar Hammerstein II, the show by Reginald Hammerstein was choreographed (the brother of Arthur Hammerstein) and was led by Danny Dare.\\" In the second sentence, the show is produced by Oscar Hammerstein II. The show is associated with Reginald Hammerstein, who is presented as Arthur Hammerstein's brother. However, it is unclear whether Reginald Hammerstein directed the show, as the information is not explicitly stated. The choreography of the show is done by Danny Dare, and it is also mentioned that the show was led by Danny Dare. The term \\"led\\" does not explicitly define the role he played in the show, which could be as the director or as a lead performer, or in another leadership role. In summary, the first sentence clearly states that Arthur Hammerstein produced the show, Reginald Hammerstein directed the show, and Danny Dare choreographed the show. The second sentence states that Oscar Hammerstein II produced the show, and the show is associated with Reginald Hammerstein (although his role is not explicitly defined), and Danny Dare is involved in choreographing and leading the show (with his specific leadership role being unclear). So, while both sentences convey similar information about a show related to the Hammerstein family and choreographed by Danny Dare, there are subtle differences in terms of the production, Reginald Hammerstein's role, and Danny Dare's additional leadership role, making the two sentences not identical in meaning."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Background: Williams was born in Nassau, The Bahamas, on November 12, 1874, to Frederick Williams Jr. and his wife Julia. At the age of 11, Bert permanently emigrated with his parents, moving to Florida. The family later moved to Riverside, California, where he graduated from Riverside High School. In 1893, while still a teenager, he joined different West Coast minstrel shows, including Martin and Selig's Mastodon Minstrels, where he first met his future professional partner, George Walker. Context: The following month, Williams & Walker had their greatest success to date with Sons of Ham, a broad farce that was perhaps most notable for its lack of the extreme \\"darkie\\" stereotypes which were then common. One of the show's songs, \\"Miss Hannah from Savannah,\\" even touched upon class divisions within the black community. The pair had already begun to transition away from racial minstrel conventions to a more human style of comedy. In 1901, they recorded 13 discs for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Some of these, such as \\"The Phrenologist Coon,\\" were standard blackface material, but the financial lament \\"When It's All Going Out and Nothing Coming In\\" was race-blind, and became one of Williams' best-known songs. Another Williams composition, \\"Good Morning Carrie\\", was covered by many artists, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1901. These discs existed only in pressings of fewer than 1,000, and were not heard by very many listeners. Sons of Ham ran for two years.  In September 1902, Williams & Walker debuted their next vehicle, In Dahomey, which was an even bigger hit. In 1903 the production, with music by Will Marion Cook and lyrics by Paul Laurence Dunbar moved to New York City, where it became the first black musical to open on Broadway. Part of the inspiration for the show was Williams' copy of a 1670 book, Africa, in which author John Ogilby traced the history of the continent's tribes and peoples. \\"With this volume, I could prove that every Pullman porter is the descendant of a king,\\" said Williams.  This was a landmark event, but seating inside the theater was segregated. One of the musical's songs, \\"I'm a Jonah Man,\\" helped codify Williams' hard-luck persona and tales of woe. It helped to establish the character Williams played most frequently in his career: the slow-talking, deep-thinking victim of life's misfortunes. \\"Even if it rained soup,\\" Williams later explained, \\"[my character] would be found with a fork in his hand and no spoon in sight.\\" However, Williams and Walker were ebullient about their Broadway breakthrough, which came years after they had established themselves as profitable stage stars. Williams wrote, \\"We'd get near enough to hear the Broadway audiences applaud sometimes, but it was some one else they were applauding. I used to be tempted to beg for a 15 job in a chorus just for one week so as to be able to say I'd been on Broadway once.\\" Walker recalled, \\"Some years ago we were doing a dance before an east side audience. They gave us a hand, and I called out to them, \\"Some day we'll do this dance on Broadway!\\" Then they gave us the laugh. Just the same we gave Broadway that same dance.\\"  In Dahomey then traveled to London, where it was enthusiastically received. A command performance was given at Buckingham Palace in June 1903. The show's British tour continued through June 1904. In May, Williams and Walker were both initiated into the Edinburgh Lodge of the Freemasons; the Scottish Masons did not racially discriminate as the United States chapters did, including the northern states. Question: Was Sons of Ham successful?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Sons of Ham was successful. This statement is justified by the fact that the show ran for two years and was a great success for Williams & Walker. More so, the play had an impact on transitioning away from racial minstrel conventions to a more human style of comedy, indicating a positive reception. Furthermore, they even managed to record some songs from the show with the Victor Talking Machine Company.

Jeff later reveals an ulterior motive for this assignment: to track down a long-lost love interest who lives in town. Darius discovers that the person behind the ad is Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), a stock clerk at a local grocery store. Jeff's attempt to approach Kenneth alienates him, so Jeff orders Darius to make contact. Darius' disaffected attitude serves her well, and she quickly endears herself to Kenneth as she poses as a candidate to accompany him on his mission.

Five people were killed in clashes between rival forces in the Yemeni capital Sanaa as nationwide protests against the government continued Wednesday. Of the dead in Sanaa, two were loyal to Gen. Ali Muhsen Al-Ahmar, who has defected to the opposition, a government security official said. The other three were regime soldiers. Government forces were sending in armored vehicles as reinforcements to the demonstrations in Sanaa, the official said. Thousands of Yemenis took to the streets in Aden, Taiz, Hodeida and Dhamar. In addition to the dead in Sanaa, two people were killed in Aden, according to medical staff at the city's Naqeeb Hospital. Meanwhile, Yemen's attorney general threatened to resign unless the government went after the killers of anti-government protesters last month. Abdullah Al-Olufi said \\"those who were responsible for killing almost 60 protesters and injuring hundreds of others should be identified and brought to justice soon.\\" \\"If the security authorities don't identify those responsible for the massacre including those who were masked, I will step down,\\" Al-Olufi said as public and external pressure mounts on President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Protests erupted in Yemen this week despite an attempt by Persian Gulf nations to decrease tensions. The Gulf Cooperation Council has urged Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, a move that falls short with the protesters who returned to the streets for marches. Opposition leaders vowed not to back down. The Joint Meeting Parties bloc, Yemen's largest opposition group, said the Gulf initiative \\"does not clearly state that Saleh must step down and only focuses on Saleh's transferring power.\\" \\"We all know the VP is not strong and will never be able to tell Saleh no, even if all his powers are transferred,\\" said senior bloc official Hasan Zaid. Saleh, in power since 1978, said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country. He has said he intends to step down but only under a peaceful and constitutional transition process. He has already promised not to run in the next round of elections. The United States, which has been allied with the Saleh government in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has welcomed past Gulf council initiatives to resolve the crisis in Yemen.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. Beginning in 1973 it signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. In 1986 Columbia Records started distributing it. In the UK, it was distributed by EMI. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue-and-lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.  - \`\` Some Girls '' is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stone 's 1978 album Some Girls . It marked the third time a song on one of the band 's albums also served as the album 's title and is noted for its risque lyrics concerning the title 's \`\` some girls '' . Alongside previous Stones releases that courted controversy ( \`\` Under My Thumb '' , \`\` Brown Sugar '' , \`\` Star Star '' ) due to their apparently degrading lyrics towards women , \`\` Some Girls '' caused a ruckus among both feminists and civil rights activists over such lyrics as \`\` black girls just want to get fucked all night '' and \`\` Chinese girls are so gentle / They 're really such a tease '' . Mick Jagger and the band defended the song , saying the lyrics mocked actual stereotypical feelings towards women . Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris commented on the controversy with a mock - editorial on the show 's Weekend Update segment : After giving the impression that he was going to openly criticize the Stones , he quoted a sanitized version of the \`\` Black girls just ... '' line , then stated \`\` I have one thing to say to you , Mr. Mick Jagger ... where are these women ? ! ? '' The song is demonstrative of the unconventional uses of steel guitars heard throughout the Some Girls album , with an unusual , droning , phased two - chord groove that 's among the Stones ' most unusual arrangements . The original cut of the song ran some 23 minutes and featured verses Jagger came up with as they went along . Harmonica player Sugar Blue provides some virtuosic blues - style solos on the track . The song was featured heavily on the Stones ' 1999 North American No Security Tour which concentrated on lesser - known songs from the band 's catalogue . A performance during the band 's 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour was captured for the 2008 live album Shine a Light .  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles.  - Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. It reached number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \\"Exile on Main St.\\"  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

If you're starting with dry hair, use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. If you decide to wash your hair, let it dry a bit before putting your hair in buns. To get big, messy Beyoncé waves, you need to give your hair some body. Whether you use a cream, gel, or spray, be sure to apply a light coat to all of your hair.  If your hair tends to get frizzy, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or oil as well. If you plan on blowdrying your hair, apply heat protectant to your hair. How much hair you have will determine how many buns you'll need. If you have thicker hair, you will most likely need 2-3 buns. If you have finer hair, you can get away with 1-2 buns. Hold each section in place with a hair tie until it is time to put it in a bun.  The way you divide your hair is completely up to you. For example, you can part your hair down the middle so that you have one bun on each side of your head, or you can  place the top half of your hair in one bun, and the bottom half of your hair in another bun. This method works best on longer hair styles. If you have shorter hair, you may need to add an extra bun or two to ensure that no pieces of hair are left out of a bun. Take the first section of your hair out of it's hair tie. Twirl your hair and twist it into a bun – think of tight Princess Leia buns, or the swirl of a cinnamon roll to give you an idea of what these buns should look like. Don't worry about the buns looking perfect, but make sure all of your hair is twisted tightly.  Secure the bun with a hair tie, a hair clip, or bobby pins. Make sure the ends of your hair are tucked into your bun. Repeat this process with each section of hair. Ideally, you should sleep in your buns overnight to set the waves into your hair. If you're able to sleep in your buns overnight, tie a scarf around your head to prevent your hair from frizzing. If you don't have all night to let your hair dry, it's time to blow dry those buns! To ensure your buns are thoroughly dried, blow dry each bun for at least 10 minutes. (Remember, if you plan on blowdrying your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair before you put it in buns). Unwrap each bun and gently loosen each twist with your fingers. Once you've taken all of your buns down, style your hair. If you like the messy waves, only use your fingers to comb through your hair. If you want a smoother look, brush your hair. Finish your Beyoncé look with hairspray.","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to achieve big, messy Beyoncé waves using the bun method.

The question is referring to the release of gases as a factor affecting the ice cube formation. However, the amount of gases escaping from the water source has little to no effect on the number of ice cubes being made. The key factors affecting the number of ice cubes made are the size of the ice cube tray and the amount of water added to it.

A:","output":"A: The missing first step of the following process is: 1. The death and accumulation of plant or animal remains: In this step, plant or animal remains accumulate in a specific area, typically in swamps, peat bogs, or other environments with low oxygen levels, which helps to slow down decay. The dead organic material accumulates over time, eventually forming layers. The process can also begin with a large amount of plant and animal materials being quickly buried, such as in the case of natural disasters. This initial accumulation sets the stage for the subsequent steps: 2. They are buried under layers of soil: Over time, more sediment accumulates on top of the organic material, burying it deeper and deeper. 3. Pressure builds over time: As the layers of sediment continue to accumulate, the pressure on the organic material increases, which leads to compression and compaction. 4. The remains liquefy: Due to the pressure and heat generated by the sediment layers above, the organic material undergoes chemical and physical changes, and the remains start to liquefy. 5. The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance: As temperature and pressure continue to increase, the carbon atoms in the liquefied organic material rearrange themselves, transforming into a new substance, such as peat, lignite, bituminous coal, anthracite, oil, or natural gas.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented suggests that the mother bird becomes more ferocious and attacks more predators. This alteration could have several potential effects on the process of egg incubation, hatching, and raising the baby birds. 1. Increased survival rate of eggs: If the mother bird is successful in attacking and deterring more predators, this may result in fewer instances of eggs being damaged or eaten by predators. Consequently, more eggs could remain in the nest and go through the incubation process. 2. Greater stress for the mother bird: If the mother bird is constantly aggressive and vigilant in attacking predators, she may experience heightened stress levels, which could have adverse consequences on her overall health. This stress might also negatively impact her ability to properly incubate the eggs. 3. Less time for incubation and care: The mother bird's increased ferocity and efforts to protect the nest from more predators might require her to spend more time away from the nest, leading to less time spent incubating the eggs. In extreme cases, this could result in some eggs not being incubated properly, which would negatively affect their development and likelihood of hatching. 4. A possible impact on the father bird's role: Depending on the bird species, the father bird might play a role in incubation and caring for the young. The mother bird's increased aggression and protective behavior could affect the father bird's involvement, resulting in either more or less assistance in incubating the eggs and raising the hatchlings. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a more ferocious mother bird attacking more predators can have both direct and indirect effects on the egg incubation process. Some of these effects can be positive, such as an increased survival rate for the eggs due to better protection, while others can be negative, like less time available for incubation or increased stress levels for the mother bird. These potential effects will vary depending on the specific bird species and the degree of change in the mother bird's behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  Which of the two mountains had less sedimentary rock?  Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Answer:","output":"The Berg mountains in Berg county have less sedimentary rock.  To understand why this is the case, we need to analyze the geological characteristics of both mountain ranges.  The Berg Mountains in Berg county are described as being volcanic in nature. Volcanic mountains are formed by magma (molten rock) from within the Earth's upper mantle that rises to the crust. When it reaches the Earth's surface, it erupts to form mountains. Over time, the surrounding rock and ash around the volcano cool and solidify, forming a mountain. So the predominant kind of rock in such terrain will be igneous, not sedimentary. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava, and it contributes significantly to the geological character of volcanic mountains such as the Berg Mountains. On the other hand, the Gorge mountains in Gorge county are said to be made up of sedimentary rocks, which are rocks that are formed over millions of years from accumulated layers of sediment. Specifically, these mountains are predominantly limestone, a type of sedimentary rock which comprises about 10% of all sedimentary rock. In this type of landscape, elements such as karst landscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites are formed due to the weathering and erosion of the limestone through interaction with water, which is why Gorge mountains have these features. Therefore, considering that the Berg Mountains originated mostly from volcanic activity and comprise mainly igneous rocks, while the Gorge Mountains are predominantly made of sedimentary rock such as limestone, we can conclude that Berg Mountains have less sedimentary rock compared to the Gorge Mountains."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

As a matter of fact, the foam is where young spittlebugs  live. These insects are protected by the foam, and they usually don't do much harm to the plants. As we all know, in late summer, a mother spittlebug lays her eggs on the plant. The babies will hatch  in spring. After they come to the new world, they begin to eat juice from the plant. The babies eat more juice than their bodies need for food. The extra juice mixes with a special waste that the spittlebugs produce. When this fluid  is released, it mixes with the air, forming bubbly foam. What is so great about having a foam home? The space inside is so wet that it can keep the bugs' soft bodies from drying out. And the foam tastes bad, so it keeps away most animals that would eat the bugs. Some birds will reach their heads through the foam to find the bugs. Wasps and ants might eat them, too. But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland. A:","output":"What is the purpose of the foam produced by young spittlebugs? a) It helps them jump from plant to plant.      b) It gives them food to eat. c) It protects them from drying out and potential predators. d) It attracts other spittlebugs."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Michael provides Cameron with information on the schools various cliques. During the tour, Cameron spots the beautiful and popular Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) and is immediately smitten with her. Michael warns that Bianca is shallow, conceited, and worst of all, not allowed to date. Michael does, however, inform Cameron that Bianca is looking for a French tutor.At the Stratford residence, Biancas outcast older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) receives a letter of acceptance to Sarah Lawrence College. Her protective father, Walter (Larry Miller), is distraught by the news, as he wants Kat to attend college nearby. Kat distracts her father by revealing that Bianca was given a ride home from school by Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan). Bianca begs her father to allow her to date, but to no avail. Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father to come up with a new rule: Bianca can only date if Kat is dating.Cameron starts tutoring Bianca, and she informs him of her fathers rule after Cameron makes many failed attempts to ask her out. This news motivates Cameron and Michael to set out to find a boy who is willing to date Kat.Cameron suggests Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), an outcast who is just as ill-tempered as Kat. Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance, but Patrick scares him off. Michael then poses the idea to Joey, also attempting to date Bianca, to pay Patrick to take Kat out.

Answer the following question: Information:  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Oscar Woolverton Griswold ( 22 October 1886 -- 28 September 1959 ) was an American soldier and general in the first half of the 20th century . He is best known for his command of the XIV Corps in the South Pacific Area and South West Pacific Area during World War II.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - The South Pacific Area (SOPAC) was a multinational U.S.-led military command active during World War II. It was a part of the U.S. Pacific Ocean Areas under Admiral Chester Nimitz.  - A non-commissioned officer or noncommissioned officer (NCO, colloquially non-com or noncom) is a military officer who has not earned a commission. Such is also called sub-officer in some countries. Non-commissioned officers, in the English-speaking world, usually obtain their position of authority by promotion through the enlisted ranks. In contrast, commissioned officers hold higher ranks than NCOs, have more legal responsibilities, are paid more, and often have more non-military training such as a university diploma. Commissioned officers usually earn their commissions without having risen through the enlisted ranks. \\"Mustang\\" is a slang term in the United States Armed Forces used to refer to a commissioned officer who began his or her career as an enlisted service member.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity. This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident. How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month? In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _  We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines.

Let's add 66 * n to both sides of the equation. This will help us put all the \\"n's\\" on the left side together: 81 * n + 66 * n = -66 * n - 882 + 66 * n Now the -66 * n on the right side and the 66 * n on the left side will cancel out: 147 * n = -882 We're almost there! Now, we just need to find what number \\"n\\" is by dividing both sides by 147: n = -882 / 147 And when we do the division, we find out that: n = -6 So, the value of n in this equation is -6.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the Viola is named after?  The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Answer: The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech. Question: how many pounds is a ton? Answer:","output":"A ton is a unit of weight commonly used in the United States and some other countries that use the imperial system. It is not the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech globally, as the metric ton, used in the metric system, is slightly heavier. However, in the context of the question asked, I'll provide the answer based on the unit of measure inquired about. There are two primary types of tons: the short ton and the long ton. The short ton, often simply referred to as a \\"ton\\" in the United States, is equivalent to 2,000 pounds (907.18 kilograms), while the long ton, usually used in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, is equal to 2,240 pounds (1,016.05 kilograms). To clarify the initial answer provided: - If Ton refers to the short ton, which is the unit predominantly used in the United States, then the correct answer would be: Yes, a short ton is equivalent to 2,000 pounds. - If Ton refers to the long ton, which is mainly used in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, then the correct answer would be: No, as a long ton is equivalent to 2,240 pounds. Additionally, it is important to mention the metric ton, which is equal to 1,000 kilograms, or approximately 2,204.6 pounds.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama, the second of Clovi and Marvella Smith's six children (five boys and one girl). While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at Brookley Air Force Base. When Smith was six his family moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles. His father became a delivery truck driver for Safeway stores, while his mother became an aide at a nursing home. In 1985, Smith amassed a .276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals as a team won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the now best-of-seven NLCS, a split of the first four games set the stage for Game 5 at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda called upon closer Tom Niedenfuer to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his previous 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3-2 Cardinals victory. Smith said, \\"I was trying to get an extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, I was able to get the ball up.\\" The home run not only prompted broadcaster Jack Buck's \\"Go crazy folks\\" play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.  After Smith's teammate Jack Clark hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).  What was not publicly known during the regular season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11-14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10\\" (1.78 m), 180-pound (82 kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, \\"I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio--everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery.\\"  Because of his injury, Smith let his then four-year-old son Nikko perform his traditional Opening Day backflip before the Cardinals' first home game of the 1986 season. Smith made an \\"eye-popping\\" play later that season on August 5, during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning, Phillies first baseman Von Hayes hit a short fly ball to left field, which was pursued by both Smith and left fielder Curt Ford. Running with his back to home plate, Smith dove forward, simultaneously catching the ball while parallel to the ground and flying over the diving Ford, avoiding a collision by inches. Did he have any home runs?","output":"Yes, Smith did hit a home run. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 5 during the playoffs, Smith hit a walk-off home run. It was very special because it was his first home run in his 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats. This home run helped his team, the Cardinals, win the game 3-2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Question: For how long does Chan's mother probably work inthe garden every day? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"iv. not enough information. There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine how long Chan's mother works in the garden every day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: How does Audrey know Red's father?, using the article: Tom Stansfield is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor. Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa, who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer. One of Tom's tasks is to guard their owl, O-J, which lives in an open cage (it has not been able to fly due to a deep depression, from the loss of a prior mate). When the bird drinks from the toilet polluted with drugs, it flies away. Jack's ex-secretary Audrey goes to the house to try to earn her job back. After fighting with her boyfriend, she stays over at the house. Lisa returns home after finding out that her boyfriend Hans is cheating on her. Tom hides from her everything that happened and she spends some time with her thinking he is homosexual. He clarifies to her that he's actually straight and she starts to like him. Audrey's friend thinks she has breast cancer and asks Tom to feel her breasts. Lisa walks in on them and is disgusted by the situation., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Audrey knows Red's father because she used to work as a secretary for Jack Taylor, who is Red's father. Jack is also Lisa's father, making him the overprotective father mentioned in the story. Audrey goes to the house to try to earn her job back, and during her time there, she is indirectly involved in the comedic events that unfold, which includes Red's return and the ensuing chaos."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we need to add the big numbers: 15988 + 22172 = 38160 So now the equation looks like this: 0 = 530 * a + 38160 Next, we want to move the big number to the other side of the equal sign. To do that, we can subtract it from both sides: 0 - 38160 = 530 * a - 38160 This leaves us with: -38160 = 530 * a Now, to find out what \\"a\\" is, we can divide by 530: -38160 / 530 = a When we do that, we get: a = -72 So the value of \\"a\\" is -72."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself.

Then she fell from a boulder and shattered her hip, finding herself immobile and alone in a sun-baked wilderness.      When Claire's friends in Southern California asked her to cat sit at their home near Joshua Tree National Park for a few weeks, she was more than happy to accept.      The New Zealander had hiked before in the Joshua Tree park and loved the desert landscape with its \\"Dr Seuss-like\\" trees and cacti.      Early one morning, she drove out to the wilderness for a six-hour hike. She stocked up with several litres of water, a hiking stick, and sunscreen.      \\"I was feeling very much like this is where I want to be right now,\\" Claire told the BBC.      At 08:30, Claire spoke to a guide at the information centre about the route. He described it as a moderate hike on a nice trail.      Claire followed the trail for two miles, and then realised she couldn't locate the three-mile marker. She decided to take a break, resting on one of the giant boulders while figuring out the route.      \\"It was when I stood up to get down from the rock, I was quite high up, and it was so slippery that I immediately went down,\\" Claire said.      \\"I knew there was nothing I could do to stop myself.

She's most looking forward to being independent once more. ||||| On Tuesday 22 May Claire was hiking in Joshua Tree National Park when she slipped off a high boulder and fell 15ft onto rocky ground, shattering her pelvis. She couldn’t move, not even to sit up or lie on her side. Her left ankle was dislocated.She couldn’t get a signal on her phone. And nobody knew she was there. She was housesitting for absent friends so, although she’d mentioned to them she was going on the hike, there was nobody to notice her not returning home. All she could do was lie where she had fallen, scream for help, and try to protect herself as best she could from the desert heat. By Wednesday afternoon she ran out of water so had to drink urine. She fashioned a curtain from a stick and a plastic bag and held it between her face and the scorching sun for hours on end.On Friday 25 May - four days and three nights of being splayed, broken, on the desert floor - Claire’s travelling friend sensed something was up. They called neighbours to check in on her, and eventually her car was located at the trailhead. A few hours later Claire was rescued by helicopter search crew and taken to Desert Regional Medical Centre.The hospital staff have done all they can to minimise her pain. Claire says she is blown away by the level of care she is receiving, and praises the doctors and nurses for their amazing care. Of course, the costs do mount up and although Claire has US medical travel insurance, it is limited. Two helicopters, round-the-clock meds and opioids, multiple x-rays and CT scans, surgery by a pelvic specialist and ongoing physical therapy... there are going to be big bills.We’d be so grateful for any contributions to these medical costs, no matter how small. Thank you, thank you, thank you.Ps: To those asking why this GoFundMe was set up earlier than the date of the accident (and it’s a good question): Claire was previously crowdfunding via friends and family to buy a used car. When she had the accident those same friends and family offered to put that money towards the medical expenses. From there it was shared with the public. (Claire will not be driving for quite some time!)Funds: as Claire does not have a Canadian bank account, for the purposes of banking, the beneficiary of the funds is Caroline Nitsch, Claire’s close friend and bedside companion who helped set up this campaign. She will be transferring the funds to Claire for medical costs. ||||| An injured hiker survived for 72 hours in Joshua Tree National Park after drinking her own urine.      Claire Nelson was found stranded in southern California three days after she fell and broke her pelvis.      She later tweeted: “Nobody could hear me scream. I would have died by the weekend.

When her water ran out, she started drinking her own urine, which she said tastes like “bad, flat beer.”      The woman used her sunscreen bottle cap to collect her urine and drink it.      For three days, she was unable to move and used her clothing as a shelter from the sun.      She planned to meet a friend on Thursday and hoped that, by not showing up, a search would be sparked.      Her friend launched the alarm and a search started on Friday morning.      Claire put a T-shirt and her hat on her hiking stick, waiving it to attract attention.      The crew, on a helicopter, spotted Claire’s signal around 4 p.m. on Friday local time.      They managed to rescue her and fly her to the hospital, where she now faces a long recovery.      Her mom, Maggie Hickton, became concerned when Claire stopped updating her Instagram.      “She’s actually in good spirits but she’s still in shock,” Maggie told the Herald on Sunday.      “It was three nights in the desert with a broken pelvis.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 851,373 within the city proper, 1,351,587 in the urban area, and 2,410,960 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.  Amsterdam's name derives from \\"Amstelredamme\\", indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river Amstel. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the Dutch Golden Age (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and diamonds. In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

A:","output":"No, the statement \\"It is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used\\" wouldn't be a reasonable answer to the question \\"how did phone numbers get split 3 then 4?\\"  The split of phone numbers into two segments, often three digits and then four digits (for instance, in the United States), was actually influenced by an evolution of telephony systems and usage standards over time. Initially, phone numbers were short as they were directly related to a small local exchange. However, as phone networks expanded, longer phone numbers became crucial to deal with the increasing number of lines and connections.  The North American Numbering Plan (NANP), established in 1947, set this format of a three-digit area code, a three-digit central office code, and a four-digit station number. This made phone numbers easier to remember and dialed, even as the number of overall subscribers increased on a national level. So, to summarize, the division of phone numbers into 3-digit and 4-digit sections was a strategy to manage the growth of telephone networks, making it easier for users to remember and dial numbers. The mention of subscribers having shorter numbers for their most frequently used endpoints seems disconnected, so it would not directly answer the question about why phone numbers are divided this way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"The blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics, bass lines, and instruments.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics, bass lines, and instruments\\" is a reasonable answer. However, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed and in-depth explanation of the cultural background of blues music to better understand its origins and unique qualities. The blues is a musical genre with origins in the deep south of the United States, specifically among African American communities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The cultural background of the blues can be traced back to various African musical forms and the experiences of enslaved Africans who were forcibly brought to the United States. These Africans endured significant hardships, and their musical expressions became a vital source of self-expression, cultural preservation, and emotional survival. The blues emerged from various elements of African music combined with European and American influences, such as work songs, spirituals, and field hollers, which were transformed into a unique and powerful form of expression. The blues form is a distinctive musical pattern characterized by a 12-bar structure, which typically features a specific chord progression and a call-and-response pattern between the vocalist and the instruments. A blues song typically revolves around a central theme, often dealing with the struggles, pains, and triumphs of everyday life. This is epitomized in the lyrics, which convey raw emotions and reflect the genuine experiences of the singers. The instrumentation of blues music varies, but certain instruments are closely associated with the genre, notably the acoustic guitar and the harmonica. The guitar, with its strong and articulate rhythmic qualities, has played a significant role in shaping the sound of the blues. The harmonica, or blues harp, adds a unique timbre and expressive range to the music, allowing the performer to convey deep emotions and accentuate the feelings evoked in the lyrics. Furthermore, the blues has a distinctive bass line, often referred to as the \\"shuffle\\" or \\"walking\\" bass line. This pattern creates a steady rhythm and a sense of movement, providing a foundation for the melodic and harmonic aspects of the music. The blues also features a specific vocal delivery, frequently utilizing a technique called \\"bending\\" notes to produce a soulful and expressive sound. In conclusion, the rich cultural background of the blues is evident in its unique combination of African, European, and American influences, as well as its specific forms, lyrics, bass lines, and instruments. The blues emerged from the trials and tribulations faced by African Americans, giving rise to a powerful and emotive musical genre that continues to shape and inspire countless artists and listeners worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension to fulfill his wish of being immortalized as a musician/Magic Man. After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs. He invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town. Omar goads Mok upon meeting him, annoying Mok enough to suggest the band tries \\"Edison Balls\\"- a modern drug, which Omar and Stretch take, incapacitating them. Dizzy sneaks away. Meanwhile, Mok takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Initially unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed. After Dizzy snaps his band-mates out of their stupor, the trio find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car.

Other productions include The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning and Mametz.

The first production staged by NTW and directed by McGrath was A Good Night Out in the Valleys, which opened at Blackwood Miners Institute in March 2010. Subsequent shows have taken the company across the country, visiting communities that rarely have the opportunity to experience live professional theatre. It's a principle McGrath feels strongly about. \\"As a national theatre there are so many different voices, different stories, different artists to work with and communities to reach that you have a responsibility to think things afresh every time.\\" As McGrath prepares to leave NTW, he said it was \\"really important\\" that the leadership teams of arts organisations were \\"perpetually refreshed\\". \\"So when I was offered the chance of a fantastic role in a city I love, Manchester, running the hugely successful international festival there, I thought that would be a great next step for me and an exciting new challenge. \\"But it also felt like the right time to be handing NTW on, and to give somebody else the opportunity of doing one of the best jobs in the world.\\" He said it had been a \\"real joy\\" to set up the theatre and not having a traditional venue meant the company had to think things from scratch and that had been part of NTW's \\"great freedom\\" to reinvent things.

Options: - lift weights - shortness of breath - collapse - error - run  Explain why a human would choose \\"shortness of breath\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"shortness of breath\\" to answer the question above because it is the option most closely related to the physiological effects of exercising. Out of the given options, shortness of breath most accurately represents a typical outcome that results from physical exertion experienced during exercise. Before delving into why shortness of breath is the most suitable answer, it is essential to examine the other options as well. The options \\"lift weights\\" and \\"run\\" are specific types of exercises, not the outcomes or consequences of exercise. Similarly, the option \\"error\\" is not an appropriate answer, as it does not pertain to any physiological or psychological effect resulting from exercise. However, the option \\"collapse\\" may seem like a probable consequence of exercising, especially if done excessively or without proper precautions. While collapse could result from overexertion, dehydration, or other exercise-related issues, it is not a universal effect of exercise. In contrast, shortness of breath is a more common and expected outcome experienced by people when they exercise. Now, let us focus on the chosen answer, \\"shortness of breath.\\" During exercise, the body requires more oxygen to meet the increased demand for energy in the muscles. As a result, the respiratory system works harder to deliver more oxygen to the body, which leads to an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. This phenomenon, termed \\"shortness of breath\\" or \\"dyspnea,\\" is a normal response to physical exertion.  In most healthy individuals, shortness of breath is momentary and resolves as the body adapts to the increased demand for oxygen. However, when people have pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart problems, they may experience more severe shortness of breath during exercise. In these cases, healthcare professionals may advise patients to engage in specific exercises or closely monitor their activity levels to manage their symptoms. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"shortness of breath\\" to answer the question because it represents a common and typical physiological outcome of exercising. While some of the other options provided may partially relate to certain aspects of exercise, shortness of breath accurately depicts the immediate effect exercise has on the respiratory system and is a natural response to increased physical exertion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question The Vikings' twelfth game was an interconference duel with the Bills inside their dome and the first home game for interim head coach Leslie Frazier. On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson. However, the Bills were unable to overcome such a large deficit and couldn't come up with another come-from-behind victory.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

They defied torrential rain to demand justice for Mr Nisman, who had been investigating the government. The prosecutor was found dead in his apartment on 18 January. It is still not clear whether he killed himself or was murdered. Mr Nisman was investigating Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack, the 1994 bombing of the Amia Jewish centre. The silent march was called by prosecutors demanding a full investigation. Mr Nisman's ex-wife, federal judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado, and their two daughters joined the demonstration, which lasted nearly two hours. Similar protests took place across the country. Argentines living in Spain, France, Israel and other countries also gathered to demand justice for Mr Nisman. Officials have denounced the march as a political move to weaken the government. Mr Nisman was found with a bullet wound to the head and a gun was lying next to him. Days earlier, he had published a 300-page report in which he accused President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman of covering up Iran's alleged role in the bombing. His body was found just hours before he was due to appear before a congressional committee to present more details of his allegations. News of his death and its timing led to speculation among some Argentines that the government may have played a role in it. The government has strongly denied both allegations. In an open letter published on her website, President Fernandez suggested rogue intelligence agents had fed Mr Nisman false information in order to destabilise her government. She also said she was convinced Mr Nisman's death was not suicide. Days later, she announced she planned to dissolve Argentina's intelligence service, SI. Critics said the move was aimed at diverting attention away from Mr Nisman's death. Earlier, President Fernandez and her cabinet attended an unrelated event at the Atucha power plant, in the city of Zarate, 90km (55 miles) north of the capital. Ms Fernandez said she would not bow to internal or external pressure and would remain in office until December, when her term ends. \\"This government will not allow anyone else to impose their rules on us,\\" she said in a speech that was broadcast on national television.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy?, using the article: Although John Foster Dulles, the United States Secretary of State recommended on 24 October for the United Nations Security Council to convene to discuss the situation in Hungary, little immediate action was taken to introduce a resolution, in part because other world events unfolded the day after the peaceful interlude started, when allied collusion started the Suez Crisis. The problem was not that Suez distracted U.S. attention from Hungary but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President Richard Nixon later explained, \\"We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] Nasser\\".The United States response was reliant on the CIA to covertly effect change, with both covert agents and Radio Free Europe. However, their Hungarian operations collapsed rapidly and they could not locate any of the weapon caches hidden across Europe, nor be sure to whom they'd send arms. The agency's main source of information were the newspapers and a State Department employee in Budapest called Geza Katona. By 28 October, on the same night that the new Nagy government came to power, RFE was ramping up its broadcasts—encouraging armed struggle, advising on how to combat tanks and signing off with \\"Freedom or Death!\\"—on the orders of Frank Wisner. When Nagy did come to power, CIA director Allen Dulles advised the White House that Cardinal Mindszenty would be a better leader (due to Nagy's communist past); he had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy, calling him a traitor who'd invited Soviet troops in. Transmissions continued to broadcast armed response while the CIA mistakenly believed that the Hungarian army was switching sides and the rebels were gaining arms.

He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The...

I came back the very next night to try this place again and it was WORSE!  I'm sorry, I SO wanted to like this please because I.LOVE.TACOS.  Who does not love tacos?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Bring a notebook and pen to the speech, so you can make note of areas that need improvement. Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it’s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time.  If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder. This way, you will have the opportunity to play back the speech more than once to get an idea of what point the speaker was making, as well as how well they said it.  Organize your notes so there’s a section on content and a section on delivery. Include examples to back up your evaluation of each. Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised?  Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up. If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn’t work, let the speaker know. It’s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice. Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience. It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it’s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture.  It might be helpful to discuss the concept of  emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you’re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged. If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first. The speaker you’re critiquing likely put some time and effort into writing and practicing the speech. Any time you’re giving a critique, it’s just as important to point out what went right as it is to discuss what needs improvement. If you’re working with a student or someone who needs help improving their speech-giving skills, be encouraging and complimentary so they have the confidence to keep working on their skills.  Try the feedback sandwich technique: give the person a compliment on an element of their speech, tell them what needs improvement, then give them another compliment. This classic way to deliver constructive criticism makes the medicine go down more easily. For example, you could tell the person he or she started with a brilliant hook, but you were confused about how the second point related to the thesis. However, the conclusion clarified the main point.  As a way to encourage the person to keep learning and improving, you might suggest he or she watch videos of speeches given by famous speakers. Point out similarities and differences between the speech you’re critiquing and the famous speech.","output":"The article advises taking detailed notes during a speech and organizing them into sections on content and delivery, providing honest feedback on the speaker's effectiveness and emotional intelligence, using the feedback sandwich technique for constructive criticism, and encouraging growth by suggesting the study of famous speeches for improvement."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors.[2] The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, but who has been dead for a hundred years.[6] After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier.[7] Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr. Blunden, until Georgie comes of age.

The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip . But according to new research from Cornell University , tips no longer serves any useful function . The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants . The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak . Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service . Tipping is better explained by culture than by the money people spend . In America , the custom came into being a long time ago . It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.  answer the following question:  What was the full name of the person that James H.

The Keystone XL Pipeline would transport oil from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. The oil would travel into the United States. In the U.S. it would be refined. The pipeline is controversial. A leak could cause damage to wildlife habitat. A leak could also release enough oil to contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer. The Aquifer is crucial to agriculture and urban development in the Midwestern U.S. When burned, the fuel from the oil sands would increase pollutants. Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere would increase. The future of the pipeline is currently on hold.  Lawmakers were debating the pros and cons of Keystone XL Pipeline. One group of lawmakers proposed that the pipeline be constructed. They put their proposal in proposal A. The rival group of lawmakers proposed that the pipeline should not be build. They put their proposal in proposal B. Lawmakers would now have to choose one of the proposals.  Which proposal might not contaminate the aquifer, proposal A or proposal B? A:","output":"Proposal B, which opposes the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, might not contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer. This is because by rejecting the construction of the pipeline, the risks associated with potential leaks and spills that could harm the environment, wildlife habitats, and the critical Ogallala Aquifer would be significantly reduced.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  Question: \\"Who led the famous Salt March to the sea?\\" Answer: \\"Nehru\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The correct answer is: Mahatma Gandhi led the famous Salt March to the sea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Mendoza believes that this newfound recognition will not only benefit his personal career but also put a spotlight on the entire Filipino film industry, inspiring young filmmakers and bringing international awareness to the creative talent that the country has to offer. This incredible achievement by Mendoza has undoubtedly made a significant impact on the film industry both locally and globally. By winning the best director award for \\"Kinatay\\" at Cannes, Mendoza proved that Filipino filmmakers can indeed compete with cinematic heavyweights from around the world, such as Quentin Tarantino. It is an exciting opportunity for the Philippines to showcase its unique cinematic voice, the rich culture and diverse stories that can be told through the medium of film. Mendoza's success and the admiration of Hollywood figures like Sean Penn and Quentin Tarantino have all helped draw more focus to the Filipino cinema, highlighting its potential. This attention is made more impressive when considering that Mendoza achieved all of this in just four years since he began directing. Such an impressive track record helps to fuel the dreams and aspirations of other Filipino filmmakers, making it possible to imagine a future where this example sets a precedent and encourages others to succeed on the global stage as well. Beyond individual success, this positive spotlight on Filipino cinema could also have financial and social benefits for the country's film industry. With their films gaining international recognition, local studios and filmmakers are now more likely to receive funding for their projects, giving them the means to continue creating and sharing their art. Furthermore, a thriving, well-funded film industry can contribute substantially to the nation's economy, providing jobs, inspiring tourism and enhancing the country's international reputation for arts and culture. In conclusion, Brilliante Mendoza's stunning Cannes win not only elevated his personal career and the status of his film \\"Kinatay,\\" but it also brought the whole country's burgeoning film industry to a new level of attention and respect. Thanks to Mendoza, both established and aspiring Filipino filmmakers now have a shining example of what they can achieve on the world stage, thereby encouraging a new generation of talent. This success can have far-reaching and lasting effects on the entire Filipino film industry, its economy, and its global reputation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is important to note that there seems to be a slight error or confusion in the hypothesis. The name mentioned in the paragraph is Carl Nielsen, not Carl Andersen. As the paragraph states, Maskarade is an opera in three acts by Carl Nielsen, who created the music for it. Vilhelm Andersen is the one who wrote the Danish libretto, which is based on a comedy by Ludvig Holberg. The opera was first performed in 1906 at Det Kongelige Teater, Copenhagen, and it is indeed considered to be Denmark's national opera. So, to clarify, the hypothesis should have questioned if Carl Nielsen, not Carl Andersen, is the creator of Maskarade. Based on the given paragraph, it can be firmly established that Carl Nielsen composed the music for the opera Maskarade, while Vilhelm Andersen wrote the Danish libretto. Since creation goes beyond just the composition of the music and also includes the libretto, one could argue that both Carl Nielsen and Vilhelm Andersen have contributed to the creation of the opera.

Check that your home contains GFCIs (ground fault circuit interrupters) or AFCIs (arc fault circuit interrupters), which prevent electrical shock and fire by shutting off faulty circuits. Be careful about do-it-yourself electrical projects, and consider hiring a licensed electrician to handle any necessary repairs or installations. GFCIs are particularly important to have in areas where water and electricity may come into close contact, such as kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and outdoors. These devices are designed to quickly shut off power when they detect even minor imbalances in the electrical current flow, protecting you and your family from the potential risk of electrical shock. AFCIs, on the other hand, are designed to prevent fires caused by arcing faults in your home's wiring system. These devices detect potentially hazardous arcing conditions and instantly shut off the affected circuit, reducing the risk of electrical fires. It's a good idea to have AFCIs installed in bedrooms, living rooms, and other areas of the house where people spend most of their time. Additionally, when dealing with electrical projects, it's crucial to exercise caution. While some minor electrical work can be done by homeowners themselves, it's always best to consult with a professional electrician when unsure about the project's safety or complexity. Attempting to fix or install wiring without proper knowledge and training could result in serious injury or even an electrical fire. Keep in mind that local laws and building codes may dictate which electrical projects can be done independently and which require a licensed professional. In conclusion, to practice fire safety in your home, make sure to check your electrical appliances, cords, and outlets regularly. Install GFCIs and AFCIs in required areas of your home and be cautious when tackling do-it-yourself electrical projects. By doing so, you'll be taking a proactive approach to keeping your home and family safe from potential electrical hazards and fires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.

Here is a news article: NEW YORK -- When Newsweek published Andrew Sullivan's cover story three weeks ago with the provocative headline \\"Why Are Obama's Critics So Dumb?,\\" former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin quickly took the magazine to task on Twitter.      \\"Newsweek: know what's truly 'dumb'?\\" Palin tweeted. \\"Giving a cover story to the TrigTruther conspiracy kook writer who thinks I didn't give birth to my son.\\"      Sullivan, a veteran journalist who brought his popular Daily Dish blog to the Daily Beast and Newsweek a year ago, has long questioned Palin's account of how she gave birth to Trig, her fifth child, in April 2008. Salon, among other news outlets, has looked into the matter and last year debunked the theory that Palin didn't give birth to Trig.      Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of Newsweek and the Daily Beast and oft-described \\"Queen of Buzz,\\" is renowned for running attention-grabbing stories and covers in hopes of sparking conversation and controversy. So it's not surprising Brown would commission a piece from Palin on Trig just weeks after Palin took a shot at one of the magazine's top writers over his history of raising doubts about Trig's birth.      But a Daily Beast spokesperson says the Palin piece was assigned last week following the news that Rick Santorum's daughter, Bella, had been hospitalized and he was briefly leaving the campaign trail.      \\"We asked Sarah Palin if she would like to share her personal story about life with a child with special needs upon learning about Senator Santorum's decision last week to place his campaign on hold to be with his daughter,\\" the spokesperson emailed.      Palin's article, \\"My Life With Trig,\\" is now online and in the iPad edition of Newsweek that's on sale Sunday. The print issue hits newsstands Monday.      While Palin doesn't address those who've questioned her account of Trig's birth, it's hard not to view the first-person essay as something of a response to Sullivan, especially given her recent criticism of him and Newsweek. She writes:      When I discovered early in my pregnancy that my baby would be born with an extra chromosome, the diagnosis of Down syndrome frightened me so much that I dared not discuss my pregnancy for many months. All I could seem to muster was a calling out to God to prepare my heart for what was ahead. My prayers were answered beyond my shallow understanding of what true joy could be. Yes, raising a child with special needs is a unique challenge, and there's still fear about my son Trig's future because of health and social challenges; and certainly some days are much more difficult than if I had a \\"normal\\" child.      Since the end of the 2008 presidential campaign -- when Palin came to prominence on the national stage -- she's had a complicated, co-dependent relationship with the news media. She's famous for attacking media elites while also profiting off their attention by securing lucrative book deals and a multimillion-dollar contract with top-rated cable network Fox News.      In July, Palin landed on Newsweek's cover and helped drum up more media speculation that she'd run for president by declaring, \\"I can win.\\" MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell blasted Newsweek's \\"desperate attempt to boost newsstand sales,\\" while stating that Palin \\"is never going to run for president or any other elective office.\\" Months later, Palin finally ended the media guessing game by announcing she would not run.      While Palin seems to have a good relationship with Newsweek under Brown's stewardship, she clashed with the previous regime. In May 2010, she called the magazine \\"sexist\\" for using a Runner's World photo of her for its cover.      \\"We chose the most interesting image available to us to illustrate the theme of the cover, which is what we always try to do,\\" then-editor Jon Meacham told The Huffington Post at the time. \\"We apply the same test to photographs of any public figure, male or female: Does the image convey what we are saying? That is a gender-neutral standard.\\"            Earlier on HuffPost: ||||| Last week, Rick Santorum and his family offered us a reminder of what really matters. When his 3-year-old daughter, Bella, born with Trisomy 18, was hospitalized with pneumonia, Rick left the campaign trail to be by her bedside. In the middle of this very heated campaign season, many of us prayed through tears for Bella’s health and added prayers of thankfulness for a public example of someone’s sacrifice made with the right priorities.      It’s a sacrifice every parent and caregiver of a child with special needs sympathizes with. Families of children with special needs are bonded by a shared experience of the joys, challenges, fears, and blessings of raising these beautiful children whom we see as perfect in this imperfect world.      During the 2008 presidential campaign, on rope lines at rallies across the country, my husband, Todd, and I met so many of these families and caretakers, and I’ll never forget them. There was an instant connection—a kind of mutual acknowledgment that said, “Yes, these children are precious and loved. Yes, we face extra fears and challenges, but our children are a blessing, and the rest of the world is missing out in not knowing this.”      Every parent struggles with juggling the commitments of work and family. Women, especially, know this well. Over the years, I’ve learned that women can “have it all,” just not all at once. For me, it was a lesson learned through the school of hard knocks, but it was one my own mother made me aware of when she calmly told me that as a working mom in the rough-and-tumble political arena, I would have to make tough choices. We all do. In making decisions about my career, I’ve put my family first, and I’ve never regretted it, although it has meant periodically putting particular pursuits on the back burner.      When I discovered early in my pregnancy that my baby would be born with an extra chromosome, the diagnosis of Down syndrome frightened me so much that I dared not discuss my pregnancy for many months. All I could seem to muster was a calling out to God to prepare my heart for what was ahead. My prayers were answered beyond my shallow understanding of what true joy could be. Yes, raising a child with special needs is a unique challenge, and there’s still fear about my son Trig’s future because of health and social challenges; and certainly some days are much more difficult than if I had a “normal” child.      Sarah Palin with her son, Trig. (Jack Kurtz / ZUMA-Corbis)      Many everyday activities like doctor’s appointments and social gatherings and travel accommodations and even mealtimes and a solid night of sleep are that much more difficult, but at the end of the day I wouldn’t trade the relative difficulties for any convenience or absence of fear. God knew what he was doing when he blessed us with Trig. We went from fear of the unknown to proudly displaying a bumper sticker sent to us that reads: “My kid has more chromosomes than your kid!” He may not be the next Wayne Gretzky, but our hearts are filled with so much pride watching Trig giggle with his sisters’ puppies, or sway to the rhythm of his Little Angels DVDs, it’s as if he were hoisting the Stanley Cup.      Granted, I know I may be more fortunate than others to have loving friends and a big, supportive family I call on to help, including a husband who spends many sleepless nights with this restless little one. (And Todd actually makes Trig’s puréed baby food!) Others aren’t so fortunate, and in our thankfulness I am made more compassionate toward others who have less.      I often think now, what would we do without Trig? He’s our “everything that really matters.”      PHOTOS The Life of Sarah Palin      Trig is almost 4 years old now, and every morning when he wakes up, he pulls himself up, rubs the sleep out of his eyes, looks around, and then starts applauding! He welcomes each day with thunderous applause and laughter. He looks around at creation and claps as if to say, “OK, world, what do you have for me today?”      My family knows that Trig will face struggles that few of us will ever have to endure, including people who can be so cruel to those not deemed “perfect” by society. The cruelty is more than made up for, though, when someone simply smiles at our son. Nothing makes me prouder. As I explained in a Thanksgiving article, I notice it happens often in airports. Travelers passing by will do a double-take when they see him, perhaps curious about the curious look on his face; or perhaps my son momentarily exercises an uncontrollable motion that takes the passerby by surprise. Perhaps, as an innocent and candid child announced when she first met Trig, they think, “He’s awkward.” But when that traveler pauses to look again and smiles, and maybe tells me what a handsome boy I have, I swell with pride. I am so thankful for their good hearts. They represent the best in our country, and their kindness shows the real hope we need today. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article is about Sarah Palin, a former governor of Alaska, writing an article for Newsweek about her life with her son Trig, who has Down syndrome.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home.

Write an article based on this summary: A court in Russia has placed the prominent opposition activist Sergei Udaltsov under house arrest.","output":"Title: Prominent Russian Opposition Activist Sergei Udaltsov Consigned to House Arrest In a recent development concerning Russian political dynamics, a court in Russia has imposed house arrest on Sergei Udaltsov, a renowned opposition activist. This decision forms a significant part of Russia's increasingly firm stance against its dissenting voices. Sergei Udaltsov is one of the most prominent figures in Russia's opposition movement, a spirited activist renowned for his vehemently dissenting stance against the ruling government. Repression of such strong opposition voices raises concerns about the liberties of free speech and political opposition in the country. This decision was not made in isolation; it reflects an ongoing trend in Russia. The judicial system has shown repeated tendencies for handing down stringent actions against its dissenters. To fully understand the implications of Udaltsov's house arrest, it is crucial to delve deep into Russia's political and legal dynamics. Critics argue this move represents another attempt by the government to silence opposition voices in the country. By confining activists to their homes, the authorities not only restrict their physical mobility but significantly limit their ability to interact effectively with supporters, organise protests or partake in public debate. Such restrictions reduce their influence on the public, thus potentially fortifying the position of those in power. On the other hand, the government stands firm on its decision, justifying their action as a necessity to maintain peace and stability within the nation. They argue that certain opposition voices can incite unrest, which, in turn, can potentially destabilize the country.  To further analyze the situation, one cannot ignore the global implications of this decision. With international human rights organizations keeping a close eye on Russia's political domain, this verdict is likely to increase the scrutiny on Russia's human rights record.  The imposition of house arrest on Sergei Udaltsov points towards a worrying trend in Russia’s political framework. It brings into question the state of individual liberties and the freedom of expression within the nation. While the government speaks of stability, its critics argue it may come at the expense of the basic democratic principle - the right to dissent. In conclusion, the house arrest of Sergei Udaltsov represents another significant benchmark in the ongoing tensions between Russia's government and its opposition. Only time will reveal the ramifications of this decision on Russia's democratic values and its political climate as a whole. Justification for the Steps: 1. The first step is to introduce Sergei Udaltsov and his significant role in opposition activities. This sets the stage for the audience to understand the importance of the story. 2. The next step is to discuss the implications of the house arrest. This involves elaboration on its national and global effects on the political and human rights canvass. 3. After this, it's critical to present the views on the arrest from both the government and critics alike. Creating a balanced view helps retain the article's neutrality. 4. Lastly, the article is concluded by mulling over future possibilities, which incites the audience to think about the potential outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - strong odor - age well - salad dressing - flavor - age to get better  Explain why a human would choose \\"age to get better\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"age to get better\\" as the answer to the question above because it addresses the primary reason behind the instruction given to John to leave the cheese in the cellar for a few years. The process of aging cheese can significantly enhance its flavor, texture, and overall quality, making it a more enjoyable and desirable product for consumers. Let's delve into the reasons behind each choice and understand why \\"age to get better\\" is the most suitable answer. 1. Strong odor: While some aged cheeses can develop a strong odor, it is not the primary reason for leaving cheese in the cellar for a few years. Moreover, not all aged cheeses have a strong odor, and maturing cheese is more about enhancing its qualities rather than merely focusing on its smell. 2. Age well: Aging cheese does allow it to age well, but this option is quite vague and doesn’t precisely explain the purpose behind the process. Aging the cheese can enhance multiple factors such as taste, texture, and aroma, which makes the cheese more desirable to consumers. 3. Salad dressing: This option is unrelated to the process of aging cheese and does not offer any explanation for leaving the cheese in the cellar. The context of the question doesn't connect with salad dressing; therefore, it can be easily disregarded. 4. Flavor: Aging does indeed improve the flavor of the cheese, which is an essential aspect of cheese maturation. This option is relatively close to the correct answer, but it doesn't encompass the overall improvement of cheese quality that occurs during the aging process. 5. Age to get better: This is the most suitable answer among the options provided since it accurately states the primary reason for leaving cheese in the cellar for a few years. As cheese ages, it undergoes several chemical reactions that improve its taste, texture, and aroma. The enzymes in cheese break down proteins and fats into smaller, more complex compounds that positively impact flavor. The aging process also allows the cheese to lose moisture, which can concentrate its flavors and result in a firmer texture. Ultimately, aging cheese transforms it into a better-quality product sought after by consumers. In summary, a human would choose \\"age to get better\\" as the answer to this question because it captures the primary purpose of aging cheese, which is to enhance its overall qualities, making it more enjoyable and desirable for consumption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After first encountering the family, the Goonies come back after the Fratellis have left and discover their criminal intents, and send Chunk, the group's clumsy, heavy-set dreamer and teller of tall tales, to get help. However, the Fratellis return before they can leave, forcing the Goonies to use a cavern underneath the restaurant to escape. The Fratellis capture Chunk and interrogate him, learning nothing until a pack of bats burst out of the cavern beneath the restaurant. Chunk is placed in the same room with the forsaken and deformed Fratelli brother, Sloth, while the rest of the Fratellis enter the cavern and follow the Goonies' trail.As the Goonies traverse the cavern, Mikey discovers that it matches up with the map and convinces the rest of the group to continue to follow it to find the treasure. They overcome many deadly traps set by One-Eyed Willie, and eventually arrive at a large underground... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Goonies,\\" the characters saved by the timely arrival of Chunk and Sloth are the other Goonie kids. After being captured and interrogated by the Fratelli family. Chunk, the more clumsy and heavy-set friend, befriends Sloth, the deformed and neglected member of the Fratelli family. Together, they break free and rush to aid the rest of the Goonies, who are in a dangerous predicament by this point. In their timely arrival, Chunk and Sloth enable the Goonies to not only escape the clutches of the Fratelli family but also provide needed support in their pursuit of One-Eyed Willie's treasure, thus saving their homes from foreclosure.  In a broader sense, they also save the spirit of adventure and friendship that defines the Goonies, ensuring that their shared journey and fight to save their homes is ultimately successful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Dig under the foxtail and turn the plants under the soil, packing them down into the dark, hot conditions. Doing so can impede growth and help kill off this pesky grass. Work by moonlight, at dawn, or at dusk. There is some speculation that turning the soil exposes the foxtail to a bright flash of light, thereby stimulating the plant and making it grow faster. If you turn the soil at night instead of during daylight hours, though, you can reduce this effect by as much as 78 percent. Alternatively, you could dig out the weeds one by one and dispose of them elsewhere, away from the contaminated area. Make sure that you remove the entire plant, including the roots, and not just the top portion.  Remove the seed heads first to prevent them from spreading and repopulating the area with additional foxtail. After removing the seed heads, dig beneath the plants using a long, slender weeding tool to get at the long roots. Note that weeds are easier to pull when the soil is wet and the weeds are young. Foxtail is no exception to the rule. Pull the foxtail from its base if working by hand. Wear thick gardening gloves to protect your hands as you work. You could try using a mower or weed-wacker to cut off the tops and flowering heads of the foxtail. You will need to continually re-trim the foxtail throughout the season, though, since the plant will send up another flowering head as the summer progresses. If you do opt for the mower or weed-wacker option, make sure that you clean the blades afterward to prevent the accidental spread of foxtail seed. You should also rake the lawn to remove all the heads. Taking these additional steps will improve your chances of removing the foxtail with only a surface mowing. If you like the ease and effectiveness of herbicides but do not like to use harsh chemicals on your vegetation, you can use vinegar instead. Vinegar is a natural and fairly tame acid, but it has been known to be effective in the removal of weed-type grasses like foxtail.  A typical USDA-approved vinegar is five-percent acetic acid. Pour the vinegar directly onto the foxtail at the ground level. The basic idea is to get it as close to the roots as possible. Use enough vinegar to soak the soil beneath the foxtail. It does not need to be soggy, but it should be damp to the touch. Wait a week or two after the first application and monitor the effects. Dead or dying foxtail should be pulled as soon as possible. Foxtail that is still growing even after you use the vinegar should be soaked with another round. Reapply the vinegar as needed. Note that vinegar tends to be more effective when used on fox tail at the seedling state. It might not help quite as much on mature plants. While the concept of pouring urine onto a lawn or other area of vegetation may make you cringe, it can be just as effective as vinegar when used as an herbicide. Urine is a strong, organic alkaline substance, so it can kill foxtail in the same way that a chemical herbicide might.  You can purchase \\"predator urine\\" products at garden stores. These products are usually used as deterrents or repellents against small garden pests, but they can also be used for herbicidal purposes. A cheaper and even more effective solution would be to use human urine. Collect the urine in a bucket and pour it straight onto the base of the foxtail, aiming for direct contact with the roots. As with many other control methods, you might need to use multiple applications of urine or use this organic herbicide in conjunction with physical removal methods. Remove the clumps of foxtail by hand or with a garden hoe once you notice them dying off. If the foxtail is still fairly young, kill the new growth as soon as possible by covering it with some form of mulch. Mulch can prevent sunlight and air from reaching the foxtail, essentially depriving it of the nutrients and light necessary for growth.  The foxtail will need to be trimmed close to the ground before you can apply mulch and use it as a way to get rid of the weed. If you have other plants and vegetation that you are trying to preserve, spread the mulch in between the plants and along the rows. Make sure that it covers the foxtail. Organic mulches like wheat straw, shredded leaves, and wood chips work well. Spread about 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch. You could also layer damp black-ink-only newsprint beneath the mulch to improve its ability to inhibit growth. Summary:","output":"To get rid of the pesky foxtail grass, try digging it up when it's dark outside to stop it from growing faster. Pull out the whole plant, including roots, and do this when the soil is wet and the foxtail is young. You could also cut the tops and flowering heads using a mower or weed-wacker, but clean the blades afterward and rake the lawn to remove the heads. You can use vinegar or urine to help kill the foxtail by pouring it onto the grass near the roots. Make sure to remove the dying foxtail so it doesn't grow back. To stop new growth, cover the foxtail area with mulch, which blocks sunlight and air, preventing it from growing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Credit: Ron Delvaux via The Virtual Telescope Project View full size image      Observers of Wednesday morning's total lunar eclipse might be able to catch sight of an extremely rare cosmic sight.      On Oct. 8, Interested skywatchers should attempt to see the total eclipse of the moon and the rising sun simultaneously. The little-used name for this effect is called a \\"selenelion,\\" a phenomenon that celestial geometry says cannot happen.      And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a \\"syzygy\\"), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth's atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set. [How to See the Total Lunar Eclipse (Visibility Maps)]      As a consequence of this atmospheric trick, for many localities east of the Mississippi River, watchers will have a chance to observe this unusual sight firsthand. Weather permitting, you could have a short window of roughly 2 to 9 minutes (depending on your location) with the possibility of simultaneously seeing the sun rising in the east while the eclipsed full moon is setting in the west.      Regions of visibility      From Newfoundland, the start of the partial stages of the total eclipse begins about 30 to 45 minutes before moonset.      A growing scallop of darkness will appear on the upper left part of the moon when it sets as the sun is coming up. Across eastern Nova Scotia, only the lowermost portion of the moon will be in view as it drops below the western horizon. Farther to the west and south along the Atlantic seaboard, the moon will rise completely immersed in the Earth's shadow.      The map shows the visibility regions for the Oct. 8, 2014 total lunar eclipse, which is the second of four consecutive total eclipses of the moon between 2014 and 2015.

Sky & Telescope Magazine released this viewing map.      Now you see it … now you don't?      Then again, sighting a selenelion might be problematic feat. Twenty-five years ago, in the August 1989 issue of Sky & Telescope, Bradley Schaefer, an astronomer who extensively studied the visibility of the moon when it was low in the sky, noted that the full moon only becomes visible when it is about 2 degrees up and the sun is about 2 degrees below the horizon.      So, depending on the clarity of your sky, you might have up to roughly 10 to 15 minutes before sunrise for the sky to still be dark enough, and the moon to be high enough above any horizon haze for it to be clearly visible. And keep in mind that this holds only for the uneclipsed portion of the moon. You might, however, be able to mitigate the effects of a brightening sky somewhat by using binoculars or a telescope.      If the moon is totally eclipsed prior to sunrise, you probably are going to have to scan the western horizon with binoculars as the twilight brightens in order to still detect some semblance of the Moon, which will somewhat resemble a very dim and eerily illuminated mottled softball.

A peculiar moonset      People who live in those portions of the United States and Canada that are a few hundred miles inland from the Eastern Seaboard should have a good view of the Moon's emergence from the umbra somewhat later. The low, partially eclipsed Moon in deep-blue twilight should offer a wide variety of interesting scenic possibilities for both artists and astrophotographers. From Toronto and points south through the eastern Ohio Valley and into the Piedmont to the Florida Gulf Coast, a peculiar-looking, waxing crescent moon with its cusps pointing downward will appear to set beyond the western horizon.      Farther west, across the western Great Lakes and down through the Deep South to the Gulf of Mexico, the moon will appear to be notched on its lower right side by the shadow.      Going still farther west, the Moon will go down \\"full,\\" but if the western horizon is haze-free, assiduous observers from much of Minnesota, western Iowa, eastern portions of Nebraska and Kansas as well as central sections of Oklahoma and Texas might still be able to detect a faint penumbral stain on the moon's lower right limb.

The map shows the visibility regions for the Oct. 8, 2014 total lunar eclipse, which is the second of four consecutive total eclipses of the moon between 2014 and 2015. Sky & Telescope Magazine released this viewing map. Credit: Sky & Telescope Magazine      Then again, sighting a selenelion might be problematic feat. Twenty-five years ago, in the August 1989 issue of Sky & Telescope, Bradley Schaefer, an astronomer who extensively studied the visibility of the moon when it was low in the sky, noted that the full moon only becomes visible when it is about 2 degrees up and the sun is about 2 degrees below the horizon.      So, depending on the clarity of your sky, you might have up to roughly 10 to 15 minutes before sunrise for the sky to still be dark enough, and the moon to be high enough above any horizon haze for it to be clearly visible. And keep in mind that this holds only for the uneclipsed portion of the moon. You might, however, be able to mitigate the effects of a brightening sky somewhat by using binoculars or a telescope.      If the moon is totally eclipsed prior to sunrise, you probably are going to have to scan the western horizon with binoculars as the twilight brightens in order to still detect some semblance of the Moon, which will somewhat resemble a very dim and eerily illuminated mottled softball.      This chart shows the times of the end-stages of a total lunar eclipse taking place on Oct. 8, 2014. Credit: Space.com/Joe Rao      People who live in those portions of the United States and Canada that are a few hundred miles inland from the Eastern Seaboard should have a good view of the Moon's emergence from the umbra somewhat later. The low, partially eclipsed Moon in deep-blue twilight should offer a wide variety of interesting scenic possibilities for both artists and astrophotographers. From Toronto and points south through the eastern Ohio Valley and into the Piedmont to the Florida Gulf Coast, a peculiar-looking, waxing crescent moon with its cusps pointing downward will appear to set beyond the western horizon.      Farther west, across the western Great Lakes and down through the Deep South to the Gulf of Mexico, the moon will appear to be notched on its lower right side by the shadow.      Going still farther west, the Moon will go down \\"full,\\" but if the western horizon is haze-free, assiduous observers from much of Minnesota, western Iowa, eastern portions of Nebraska and Kansas as well as central sections of Oklahoma and Texas might still be able to detect a faint penumbral stain on the moon's lower right limb.

Original article on Space.com. ||||| This Wednesday a spectacular astronomical sight will befall the night sky: a total lunar eclipse that coincides with the rising or setting of the sun.      This rare occurrence is called a selenelion and will, unfortunately for us Britons, give the moon a dazzling red sheen for those only on the east coast of the Americas, Australia or the Pacific Ocean.      In North America, it will happen on the morning of 8 October, whereas in Australia it will occur in the evening.      Dr Darren Baskill, Astronomer at the University of Sussex, told The Independent: “A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon goes into the shadow of the earth.      “It usually happens a couple of times a year and depending on the atmospheric conditions of the earth the moon can appear in different shades of red.”      We're able to see the eclipsed moon and the sun at the same time thanks to the Earth's atmospheric refraction causing their images to be lifted higher than they actually are.

It’s definitely worth getting up a bit earlier to catch a dramatic setting of the moon.”      In the United Kingdom, the sun will be heading towards its highest point in the sky due south and it will be about 10.30am when this is taking place – so eager astronomers here will miss it completely.      According to Space.com, a selenelion is a phenomenon that under the rules of celestial geometry is a technical impossibility.      The Utah People’s Post says that those on the Eastern Seaboard will be able to see a red moon at roughly 5.25am. |||||Summary:","output":"On October 8, 2014, skywatchers had the rare opportunity to witness a selenelion, a phenomenon where a lunar eclipse and the rising sun can be seen simultaneously. While celestial geometry suggests this event cannot happen due to the perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon, Earth's atmosphere refracts and lifts the images of the sun and moon above the horizon, allowing the celestial bodies to be visible just before they rise and set. This event was particularly special because the moon had a red sheen, which could be observed from the east coast of the Americas, Australia, or the Pacific Ocean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So,he visited the tanner's house and offered to buy his house.\\"I would love to sell the house if you buy it,\\" said the tanner.He didn't want to do any such thing but he liked to play tricks.\\"Give me a week or so to deal with some things,will you?\\"The moneylender agreed and went away. A week later,the overpowering smell coming from the tannery brought the moneylender to the tanner's doorstep again.\\"I understand sir,\\" said the tanner with wideeyed sympathy.\\"But my mother is visiting me this week.I can't sell the house until she goes away.Please wait for a month.\\" The moneylender agreed with great reluctance.He began to wait eagerly for the guest's departure.In the beginning he counted each day,impatiently waiting for one to finish and the other to begin.After a while,he found he was no longer so interested in the month coming to an end.He had simply forgotten about it. He did not ask the tanner to leave when they met next,either.You see,by then the moneylender had become accustomed to the tanyard's smell.\\"What have you done to drive away that terrible smell?\\" he asked the tanner.\\"Have you reduced the solution?\\" The tanner smiled and nodded.He had been waiting for the day the moneylender would get used to the smells from the tannery and stop bothering him.That was why he had asked the moneylender to wait in the first place.

Eventually, the moneylender became accustomed to the tanyard's smell, which is what the tanner had anticipated and hoped for all along. The moneylender's feelings transitioned from impatience and eagerness to a lack of interest in the situation and eventual adaptation to the unpleasant smells, but he did not specifically become anxious during this time.

Select from the following.  (a). happy about stealing.  (b). embarrassed about being fired.  (c). a thief. Answer:","output":"Answer: (b). embarrassed about being fired. Given the context provided, it is most likely that Aubrey would feel embarrassed about being fired after she was caught stealing office supplies. The act of stealing is generally considered to be unethical and dishonest, and getting caught in such an act would likely result in negative emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, or remorse.  Moreover, being fired from one's job can have significant consequences on both personal and professional levels, which may further contribute to feelings of embarrassment. Losing a job can lead to financial hardships, as well as damage one's reputation, making it difficult to secure future employment. In addition to that, one may also feel shame, as one's friends, family, and colleagues become aware of the circumstances surrounding the dismissal. In Aubrey's case, being fired for stealing office supplies would likely make her feel like she has disappointed not only herself but also those who had faith in her abilities and morals. While it is important to consider the individual's thought processes and emotions in determining their response to such an event, it is unlikely that Aubrey would feel happy about stealing (option a) since the consequences of being caught have led to her being fired. Feeling like a thief (option c) might also be a relevant emotion for Aubrey, but it does not fully encompass the range of emotions she would experience in this situation. In conclusion, Aubrey is most likely to feel embarrassed about being fired after being caught stealing office supplies. This includes the embarrassment of getting caught, the repercussions of losing her job, and the resulting effects on her personal and professional relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Photograph by Koen van Weel/AFP/Getty Images.      A few years ago, the singer and songwriter Lizzy Grant reinvented herself online. This seems overwhelmingly unremarkable behavior in the 21st century, particularly for a would-be pop musician, but it proved scandalous. Grant, a 25-year-old singer-songwriter from upstate New York, recorded an EP and an album in the late 2000s. Some time before the summer of 2011, according to a recent Billboard story, she deleted her social-networking profiles and a site bearing her name, and withdrew her album, Lizzy Grant aka Lana Del Rey, from iTunes. Last August, she uploaded a music video to YouTube under the stage name Lana Del Rey—goodbye Grant. The clip was for “Video Games,” a beguilingly morose love song. Helped along by music blogs and BBC Radio 1, which supported the track early, the video became a hit: Today, it’s been viewed more than 22 million times.      There seems to have been nothing more duplicitous in Del Rey’s jettisoning of Grant than there was in Dylan’s jettisoning of Zimmerman, but when the fact of her previous incarnation came to light, the response from online detractors was irate and impassioned: This was no diamond in the digital rough, pure and uncompromised. Grant’s debut album had, it emerged, been produced by David Kahne, an industry big with Paul McCartney and Sugar Ray on his résumé. She had, in fact, signed with the powerhouse major label Interscope a month before she’d uploaded the “Video Games” clip. A particular point of scrutiny were her lips, which appear significantly plumper today than they do in photographs from the Grant days, suggesting a surgical procedure—further fakery. In posts and comment sections on many of the same blogs that had helped Del Rey take off in the first place, listeners lashed out as though they’d been betrayed, expunging the abject corporate product they’d accepted so trustingly into their hearts. In this blood sport, the blog Hipster Runoff played the (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) head cheerleader: “She was basically a failed mainstream artist who is being ‘rebranded’ behind major label dollars,” one post sniped.      On the one hand, the controversy was good for Del Rey because it meant that far more people would listen to her music than might have done so otherwise. On the other hand, listeners drawn in by bad publicity tend to come to the table with their knives out, or at least with their guards up—not ideal attitudes for open-minded listening. In January, Del Rey sang two songs on Saturday Night Live, swaying awkwardly, brushing at her hair self-consciously, her voice bottoming out into leaden notes. The booking itself was surprisingly controversial: had she truly “earned it,” or somehow cut to the front of the line? Brian Williams, an avowed indie-music fan, groused that Del Rey was “the least-experienced musical guest in the show’s history.” Stilted, underwhelming SNL musical performances are commonplace. Del Rey’s appearance didn’t buck the trend. But it did give detractors fresh ammunition: We were fooled by a charlatan, and an inept charlatan at that!      Advertisement            Last week, Del Rey’s proper debut album, Born to Die, leaked online; it arrives in stores this week. I like the album better with each listen—the more time I spend in its company, the more I feel as though I’m approaching it on something like its own terms. The mood on “Video Games” is one of elegant confusion. On paper, the song resembles an over-the moon love letter, with lines like “Heaven is a place on earth with you,” and “It’s all for you, everything I do” —but that’s not the way it sounds. Strings, central to the album’s arrangements, swell sweetly, but the song’s dominant motif is a muted, desultory piano figure that suggests Cat Power at her broodiest. Del Rey’s delivery is somber and vaguely recriminatory, as though her boundless affections aren’t being sufficiently reciprocated by their object. The video is a mélange of tones, too, alternating found footage of couples cavorting carefree with paparazzi video of Paz de la Huerta stumbling drunkenly. Del Rey herself appears in shots that seem both intimate (they’re naturally lit and haphazardly framed) and distant (her posture is stiff, her affect dead-eyed, her retro-Hollywood make-up laid on thick).      Del Rey spends most of that song singing in a languorous, husky tone that can slip into the soporific; her voice is more limber than this performance lets on. On the chorus to “Off to the Races” she adopts a naughty-baby voice and a rapperly cadence, both reminiscent of Gwen Stefani. Del Rey dips into this same style on “Lolita” and “National Anthem”; the latter song also features a lovely little slaloming vocal on the hook that wouldn’t be out of place on a ballad by gentler, airier singers like Ben Gibbard or Ingrid Michaelson. Del Rey sprinkles her songs with hip-hop catchphrases (“ride or die,” “fresh to death,” “chasing paper”) and brief spoken interludes that nod back to the ’60s girl-groups. The tempos are laidback, but the drums are hard-hitting. The result is vibrant, frequently goofy, and, at times, unpleasantly schizophrenic: a let’s-see-what-sticks barrage of voices that Del Rey hasn’t fully refined into “her voice.”      This speaks to a larger sense that Del Rey’s true crime isn’t against laws of authenticity (whatever those are) but, to the contrary, against laws of show-business: She has yet to master the theatrical-alchemical transformation that we expect from successful pop stars. It’s strange, really, that much of the blog-borne backlash against Del Rey slammed her as yet another automaton gliding squeaky-clean and jumbo-lipped down the assembly line. It would be more precise to say that she’s unconvincingly fake: She botches the disappearance of the fumbling aspirant into the grand, naturalized pantomime of the pro.      One take on Lana Del Rey, along these lines, is that the Internet hype machine thrust her into the spotlight before she’d had a chance to work out kinks in her live performance, sharpen the fuzzy contours of her persona—in short, put her face on. She’d been caught, embarrassingly, mid-transformation: Not quite Lizzy Grant, not quite Lana Del Rey, hovering somewhere in the neighborhood of that “a.k.a.” from her first album title.      But this is exactly what makes Del Rey worth mulling, no matter what you think about the music. She strikes me as something like an anti-Nicki Minaj. Both artists have patently plastic personas that, advertising their own contingency, expose the mechanisms of pop identity-craft. But whereas Minaj has a galvanizing agency about her—she is the savvy, sexy chameleon, in control of her scattershot subjectivity, wielding her desirability as a weapon—Del Rey plays the victim and emotional punching bag, constructed (and poorly, at that) entirely in the service of male desire. Her favorite image is the female corpse, pliant and posable; the words dead, dying, and death recur over and again. In Del Rey’s lyrics, love is an obliterating, self-abnegating force, and women are its victims: “I can be your china doll if you’d like to see me fall”; “Take me like a vitamin”; “I wish I was dead.” Del Rey has called herself the “gangster Nancy Sinatra,” but she spends Born to Die walking all over herself.      Before passion snuffs out Del Rey’s heroines (as in the “Born to Die” video, in which she dies in a fiery car crash, her bloody body held aloft by her impassive beau), it pushes them to acts of derangement and disreputability designed to appeal to lovers. This motif appears in “Video Games” (“I heard that you like bad girls, honey, is that true?”), “Off to the Races” (“I’m crazy, baby, I need you to come here and save me”), and the title song (“You like your girls insane.”) Back in November, Del Rey asked an interviewer, “Have you ever seen Fire Walk With Me and the scenes where Laura Palmer is in the bar with the lumberjacks, sort of dancing and getting crazy? Well, it’s that frightening sensation of being out of control that really sticks in my mind.” Guitars that suggest ’50s rock via Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks score shimmer across the album, and Del Rey’s Palmer anecdote is a telling detail, reverberating both in the “Video Games” footage of tottering de la Huerta and across the album.      The theme of Del Rey’s unhinged subjugation to her lovers is so unrelenting that, as the album goes on, it begins to resemble an outright critique of female passivity, rather than an extreme case of it. The last song on the album, “This Is What Makes Us Girls,” confronts these issues most poignantly. The song tells a story, seemingly autobiographical, about the turbulent sexual awakening of a group of “small-town” girls who fall in with, and act crazy in attempts to impress, the “senior guys.” The song concerns youth, but death is mentioned several times. At one point, Del Rey summons a haunting image of “my new best friend, high heels in her hand, swayin’ in the wind”—a girl who, having suffered some humiliation we can readily guess at, “starts to cry, mascara running down her little Bambi eyes: ‘Lana, how I hate those guys.’ ” On the chorus, Del Rey laments, of her cohort, “We don’t stick together and we put love first.” ||||| Give Lana Del Rey credit: At least she didn’t break down and cry on Saturday Night Live. She’s a starlet to music bloggers, who’ve been buzzing over her for the past year. But for the rest of us, she’s just another aspiring singer who wasn’t ready to make an album yet. Given her chic image, it’s a surprise how dull, dreary and pop-starved Born to Die is. It goes for folky trip-hop ballads with a tragic vibe, kinda like Beth Orton used to do. Except she could sing.      Her strength is the lyrics, which have the pop-trash perversity that the music lacks. The big theme: femininity as a scam, as lost girls preen for the gaze of imaginary sugar daddies. (Loads of Lolita references, though her literary template seems to be Poison’s “Fallen Angel.”) She has clever lines; in “Diet Mtn Dew,” she rhymes “Take another drag, turn me to ashes” with “Says he’s gonna teach me just what fast is.”      But her voice is pinched and prim, and her song doctors need to go the fuck back to med school. As any fan of Madonna, Britney or Steely Dan could tell you, lyrics about the perils of seduction work better when attached to seductive tunes. In case you miss the concept, “Without You” spells it out: It’s all about “the dark side of the American dream.” But American dreams are tempting, which is why they’re dangerous. Unfortunately, this one is neither.      Listen to Lana Del Rey’s “Video Games”:      Related      • Lana Del Rey to Re-Release First Album ||||| JUST 36 HOURS AFTER THE the most polarizing Saturday Night Live performance in recent memory, Lana Del Rey is in New York, eating a cookie. “I actually felt good about it,” she says. “I thought I looked beautiful and sang fine.” But it’s clear that Del Rey has been rattled by the overwhelming Internet vitriol hurled her way after her awk­ward renditions of two tunes, including the breakout single “Video Games.” Del Rey’s ace in the hole: her debut LP, Born to Die, which blends sweeping orchestral arrangements and hip-hop beats with confessional lyrics about partying and unhealthy relation­ships. “Now my life is sweet like cinna­mon,” she sings on standout cut “Radio.” “Like a fuckin’ dream I’m livin’ in.”      How did it feel to sing on live TV?      It felt OK. The cast and crew said they loved it. I know some peo­ple didn’t like it, but that’s just the way I perform, and my fans know that.      Are you comfortable on stage?      I’m nervous. I’m not a natural performer or exhibitionist. When I was younger, I hated the focus, and it made me feel strange.      The backlash to that performance has been pretty harsh.      There’s backlash about everything I do. It’s nothing new. When I walk outside, people have something to say about it. It wouldn’t have mattered if I was absolutely excellent. People don’t have anything nice to say about this project. I’m sure that’s why you’re writing about it.      Have I given you the impression that I don’t like your music? I do! Especial­ly the song “Radio.”      No. I don’t know how you feel about it. It’s not easy to gauge how people feel about it. I don’t really want to go into it. But thank you, I love “Radio” too.      When was the first time you stepped onstage?      I was the littlest orphan in Annie when I was three.      What was the first music you loved?      We didn’t have a TV, so I remember seeing Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box” video when I was 11, at a party at my mom’s friend’s house. There was just something about the look in Kurt’s eye that made me feel like I knew what he was feeling, like I could relate to him. I still listen to Nirvana most days.      In your song “Blue Jeans,” you sing, “I grew up on hip-hop.” Did you?      I really loved Eminem. And in high school, my English teacher introduced me to Biggie Smalls. I loved “Me & My Bitch.”      Do you have a big record collection?      I’m more of a singles person. I love the Beach Boys'”Fun, Fun, Fun,” Leonard Cohen’s “Suzanne” and Nina Simone’s “The Other Woman.” And hearing Bob Dylan’s “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” for the first time was a revelation. I watched Don’t Look Back a lot and read the biography by Anthony Scaduto. Like everyone else, Bob floors me.      Where did you write “Video Games”?      In London. I was with Justin Parker, one of my producers, and I just start­ed humming and freestyling over that progression of chords. It took me about 10 minutes, maybe. We knew we had something special. It was the perfect song for me — it was me in song form.      In your song “Off to the Races,” you mention cocaine, Bacardi chasers and cognac. Do you drink much?      I’ve been clean for some time now. I haven’t had a drink in many years, but I used to. Back when I was drinking a lot, I got in trouble and was sent to boarding school. But I straightened out after that.      Lyrics about taking some­one’s body “downtown” appear twice on the album. What does that mean?      It has a couple of mean­ings. One is, “Let’s go out, let’s go downtown!” And the other is… [Laughs] That’s it. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A few years ago, singer-songwriter Lizzy Grant reinvented herself online as Lana Del Rey.

Porn star accuses MTV Ridiculousness star of sexual assault A star of the MTV series \\"Ridiculousness\\" is calling a porn star’s sex assault allegations against him absurd. Sterling (Steelo) Brim, a co-host turned producer for the TV series, is facing a police investigation following claims that he attacked the actress in Midtown Manhattan after she refused his demands. A sexual abuse complaint filed against Brim by MaryJean Vargas, 25, accuses him of repeatedly grabbing her around 4 a.m. Saturday while they were driving in her car on Central Park South. “This isn't a play. It's something that happened, and I'm hurting. And he's switching everything around and trying to play the victim. I was physically attacked. He's making me seem like I'm wrong,” Vargas told the Daily News on Monday. The Bronx hottie said she told Brim to stop, but instead of complying he moved his hands to her breast. At one point he grabbed her between her legs while saying, \\"It's mine,\\" according to police. \\"He just starts punching me, he tries to hit my face, he hits my boobs ... in the most violent way I've ever been touched,” Vargas said. “And I'm driving and I can't defend myself.\\" It was Vargas' threat of reporting the assault that caused the TV personality to jump from the vehicle while it was still moving, she claims. \\"The window was already open and I yelled 'Police! Help!' and he just got out,\\" Vargas recalled. \\"I started screaming, 'He hit me! He hit me! He's a woman hitter!' and everyone on the street starting cheering me on.\\" Brim, whose MTV program relies on amateur internet videos, tucked and rolled out the door — all the while injuring his arm and damaging his Rolex watch, according to TMZ. His camp contended he was being threatened while trapped in the porn star’s car. \\"The girl is totally lying,\\" a source close to him told The News. \\"She straight up admitted that she was going to shake him down while they were still driving around together.\\" In a Tweet to his 360,000 followers Monday evening, Brim professed his innocence. \\"God knows I could/would NEVER!!Thanks for the love,\\" he stated. A request for comment from MTV about the allegations was not immediately answered. Vargas insisted she reported the incident to police immediately and denied Brim's claim that she held him in her car against his will. The raven-haired beauty said the two have known each other for about a year, after Brim hit on her on Twitter, and have been intimate once. They spent Friday night with a group of friends in a Times Square bowling alley and a Meatpacking District club. She claimed Brim was making inappropriate sexual advances during the night. God knows I could/would NEVER!! Thanks for the love. \\"I'm brushing it off because I'm thinking we're friends and he's just a horny man,” she said. “I'm not thinking anything wrong of it.” She left the club upset after a promoter grabbed her, she told The News, and later met up with Brim at his hotel to discuss that incident. She didn’t want to go up to his room, and a walk-and-talk was also out of the question. \\"He said, 'I'm too famous to talk outside,' ” according to Vargas. They ended up in her car. Vargas, who started out as an erotic dancer before getting her big break with a spread in Penthouse — the first Dominican model to be featured in the adult magazine, she said — was adamant that that her work does not define her. \\"If you work in the (porn) industry, you think that if someone offers you something that I'm just going to sleep with you?” she asked. “No, that's not what I'm about. “What I do there is completely different than how I live.\\" With Joseph Stepansky, Nancy Dillon What was this article about?","output":"This article is about an accusation of sexual assault made by porn star MaryJean Vargas against Sterling (Steelo) Brim, who is a co-host turned producer for the MTV series \\"Ridiculousness.\\" Vargas filed a sexual abuse complaint against Brim, which has led to a police investigation.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What government position was held by the man who was interviewed on television about the operation that did not have official acknowledgement of special forces?, using the article: One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, was killed in the operation. Another twelve soldiers were injured, one seriously. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were \\"finished as a military threat\\". Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL. He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave.The morning of the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost.

Question: What happened to the group once Combo was released from prison? Movie plot title: This Is England Movie plot: In 1983, 12-year-old schoolboy Shaun gets into a fight at school after a classmate, Harvey, makes an offensive joke about his father, who died in the Falklands War. On his way home, Shaun comes across a group of young skinheads led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group, among them Milky who is the only black skinhead in the group, Lol is Woody's girlfriend, Gadget, Smell, Pukey, Kes, Kelly (Lol's younger sister), Trev, and Meggy. They accept Shaun as a member, and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style.Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding mustachioed man called Banjo. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split. Combo is impressed by and identifies with Shaun, who in turn sees Combo as a mentor figure.Shaun stays in Combo's group instead of the apolitical skinheads led by Woody. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a white nationalist meeting. After Pukey expresses doubt over the group's racist and nationalistic politics, Combo throws him out of the group and sends him back to Woody. The gang then engages in racist antagonism of, among others, shopkeeper Mr. Sandhu, an Indian man who had previously banned Shaun from his shop.Combo becomes depressed after Lol, whom Combo has loved since having sex with her one night, years before, rejects him. To console himself, Combo buys cannabis from Milky. At a party with Shaun and the other members of Combo's group, Combo and Milky bond while intoxicated. Combo invites Milky to tell him about himself. Milky describes his many relatives and comfortable family life to Combo who listens with increasing jealousy. When Milky invites him to a family dinner, Combo becomes enraged and beats Milky into a coma whilst Banjo holds Shaun...

Available options: +unacceptable. +acceptable.","output":"+acceptable. A linguist would consider the sentence \\"That the sun was out is obvious.\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically, even though it might sound a bit odd to some speakers. Let's analyze the sentence in terms of its syntax to understand why it is grammatically acceptable. The sentence structure can be categorized as a \\"noun clause (subject) + verb + adjective (predicate nominative).\\" In this case, the noun clause is \\"That the sun was out,\\" the verb is \\"is,\\" and the predicate nominative is \\"obvious.\\" Noun clauses are groups of words containing a subject and a verb, acting as a single noun in the sentence. Here, the subject is \\"the sun,\\" and the verb is \\"was out.\\" The noun clause is introduced with the subordinating conjunction \\"that.\\" In terms of syntax, the noun clause functions as the subject of the sentence. Regarding the main verb \\"is,\\" it links the subject (noun clause) to the predicate nominative, which is the adjective \\"obvious.\\" Predicate nominatives are used after linking verbs such as \\"to be\\" and provide more information about the subject. Taking all of these elements into account, the sentence is structurally sound and conforms to the rules of English grammar. While the sentence could be rephrased in a more typical way, such as \\"It is obvious that the sun was out,\\" the original sentence remains grammatically acceptable and would be understood by a linguist as valid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Tree of Life Movie plot: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Q:Information:  - A language isolate, in the absolute sense, is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical (or \\"genetic\\") relationship with other languages, one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language. Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include Ainu, Basque, Korean and Sumerian, though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages.  - Sumerian (\\"native tongue\\") is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate which was spoken in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a \\"Sprachbund\\" (area of linguistic convergence).  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Sumer was the first urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze ages, and arguably the first civilization in the world with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place.  - Sumerian literature is the literature written in the Sumerian language during the Middle Bronze Age . Most Sumerian literature is preserved indirectly , via Assyrian or Babylonian copies . The Sumerians invented the first writing system , developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out of earlier proto - writing systems by about the 30th century BC. The earliest literary texts appear from about the 27th century BC. The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian empires , even after the spoken language disappeared from the population ; literacy was widespread , and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later Babylonian literature .  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792  1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696  1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi.  - A sprachbund (\\"federation of languages\\")  also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, diffusion area or language crossroads  is a group of languages that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. They may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. Areal features are common features of a group of languages in a sprachbund.  - In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers to a geographical area with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture). These are often associated with an ethnolinguistic group and the territory it inhabits. Specific cultures often do not limit their geographic coverage to the borders of a nation state, or to smaller subdivisions of a state.

These are used by programmers to leave notes or information for themselves or future programmers. Generally, one or a series of characters will tell the computer that text is a comment and not part of the program, though what those characters are will depend on the programming language being used. For example, using the Python language the hash or number sign indicates a comment. In C++, it’s //. Variables make up a large portion of any program code. These are how the program stores information. Essentially, you will create a tag for the information you are storing and then tell the program what the information is. This can look something like: spam = ‘wikiHow rocks’. Now whenever the program later searches for spam, it will know that that is wikiHow rocks. This type of code can be used, for example, to let a program learn someone’s name, by recording it from an earlier input and attaching it to a variable. Basically, control structures tell your program how to navigate or what to do. If you’ve ever done a choose-your-own-adventure book, this is pretty much what control structures are. In programming, this usually takes the shape of statements that use “if”, “while” or “for” statements, for example. You will need to use these statements and use them correctly if you want to program correctly. Data structures are a program’s shorthand for accessing a lot of information at once. This will keep you from having to type in lots of variables, as you can instead just type in any new information and attach it properly to the list using code. Examples of data structures you might use include lists or key/value pairs (sometimes called HashMaps). Programming languages really are just like other languages in many ways. And just like other languages, there are rules that make programming ‘sentences’ either work or not work. Syntax refers to the specific order or layout of words, symbols, and numbers that make a programming language function. It is important that you learn the proper syntax for the programming language you are learning, since (unlike in spoken language) the computer will not automatically understand when you make a mistake and compensate for it. There are a number of tools that can be used to help you write your code, such as IDEs. Programs like IDEs can allow you to better visualize your code. Make sure you research and know some of the tools that are available to you, as this can make programming much simpler. While most IDEs are specific to a particular programming language, others are more multipurpose, like Microsoft’s Visual Studio.","output":"The article discusses various programming concepts, starting with comments, which are pieces of text that do not impact the actual program but serve as notes or explanations for programmers. Different programming languages use specific characters to indicate comments, such as the hash sign for Python or '//' for C++. The article also highlights the importance of variables, which are used to store information in a program. By assigning data to a specific \\"tag\\" (like \\"spam = 'wikiHow rocks'\\"), programmers can later retrieve that information by referring to the assigned tag. Variables can be used to store any type of data, such as a user's input or an item's name. Control structures are another essential programming component that dictate the flow of a program. Similar to choose-your-own-adventure books, control structures utilize statements like \\"if,\\" \\"while,\\" or \\"for\\" to determine navigational paths and guide the program's actions. Additionally, a program's efficiency can be improved through the use of data structures, which bundle large amounts of information together, preventing the need to declare separate variables for each piece of data. Examples of such structures include lists and key/value pairs (also known as HashMaps). Understanding and adhering to correct syntax is crucial for any programming language, as it defines the arrangement of words, symbols, and numbers that make the language functional. As opposed to spoken languages, computers cannot intuitively comprehend and adjust for syntax errors, making syntax knowledge vital for programmers. Lastly, the article introduces IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) as helpful tools for programmers to write and visualize their code more efficiently.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then.

He was a prominent conductor during the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris and played a crucial role in the premieres of Debussy's Jeux and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring (Le sacre du printemps). Despite his initial dislike and disbelief in the groundbreaking score of The Rite of Spring, Monteux ended up conducting it multiple times throughout his career, which helped to solidify its revolutionary impact on the world of music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chaucer, widely regarded as the father of English literature, was born in London, England, in the early 1340s and lived until October 25, 1400. He served as a poet, author, philosopher, and diplomat, and was a central figure in the world of English literature due to his extensive body of work and contributions to the development of English as a language and a literary art form during a time when Latin and French were the dominant languages of text. Geoffrey Chaucer began working on The Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century, around 1387, although the exact date is uncertain. The work is a collection of stories told in verse and prose, narrated by a group of pilgrims who are traveling from London to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury, a popular pilgrimage destination of that time. In the narrative, the pilgrims agree to engage in a storytelling competition to pass the time while they journey together. The Canterbury Tales features a diverse group of fictional characters from various social classes and professions, providing a glimpse into 14th-century English society. Some of the most notable characters and stories include The Knight's Tale, The Miller's Tale, The Wife of Bath's Tale, and The Pardoner's Tale. Chaucer employs a range of narrative styles and genres within the work, including romance, satire, allegory, and fabliaux, making the tales rich in linguistic, thematic, and literary diversity. Chaucer's writing is distinctive for its use of Middle English, which heralded a turning point in the evolution of the English language. Traditionally, literature of that era was written in Latin or Anglo-Norman French, the languages of the educated elite. Chaucer's decision to write in Middle English contributed to the establishment of English as a legitimate language for literary works and opened the door for future English authors like William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton. Although The Canterbury Tales was never completed - Chaucer had originally planned to write over 100 tales but only managed to finish 24 - the work is still celebrated for its innovation, iconic characters, and its representation of a diverse society with layered nuances. Many of the stories humorously criticize the cultural norms, corruption, and individuals of Chaucer's time, making his storytelling style both engaging and illuminating. Today, The Canterbury Tales remains a significant and influential piece of English literature that continues to be studied, translated, and adapted across various forms of media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.

Most times that macaroni and cheese is served.  C. not enough information  D. Usually at lunch time. Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Establish their difference in choices and lifestyle In this step, I'm trying to emphasize that Erin and Laura have contrasting habits when it comes to food. This point will serve as the foundation for the rest of the story.  One day, Erin invited Laura over to her house for a girls' night in. Laura was hesitant because she knew that Erin had a sweet tooth and was worried about breaking her diet, but Erin assured Laura that they'd have a great time together. As they sat down to catch up on their favorite TV show, Erin brought out a tray full of delightful treats. Step 2: Create a situation where their conflicting habits lead to personal interaction By having Erin invite Laura over to her house, I wanted to present a scenario in which Laura had to confront her dietary choices in the face of indulgence. Laura eyed the tray and swallowed hard, resisting the urge to dive into the sweets. Erin noticed her apprehensive reaction. \\"You know, you can have a cookie or two,\\" Erin said. \\"You've been disciplined for so long, I think you deserve a little reward.\\" Step 3: Introduce a dialogue between the characters addressing the issue In this step, I'm attempting to highlight the characters' thoughts and opinions regarding their different food choices, which can serve as a starting point for a possible resolution. Laura thought about it for a moment, but then she shook her head. \\"I appreciate your offer, Erin, but I made a commitment to myself, and I don't want to break it. Can we maybe find something healthy to snack on instead?\\" Step 4: Show the protagonist making a decision in line with their beliefs In this step, I emphasize Laura's determination to stay true to her dietary goals, which reveals her character as strong-willed and committed. Erin was initially taken aback by Laura's dedication but eventually, she nodded in agreement. \\"Not a problem. I'll see what I can find,\\" she said as she went to the kitchen. Erin rummaged through the fridge and found some carrot sticks and hummus. She brought it to the living room and the girls happily continued watching their TV show while munching on the healthy snack. Step 5: Present a compromise that pleases both characters In this step, I want to demonstrate that Erin and Laura value their friendship enough to accommodate each other's preferences, as Erin opts for a healthier snack option for Laura's sake. The girls' night in turned out to be more enjoyable than either of them had expected. They laughed, shared stories, and had a great time together, proving that it's not the food that forms friendships, but the love and support that they share with each other.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Reactions and Compounds of Nitrogen Like carbon, nitrogen has four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p), so it can participate in at most four electron-pair bonds by using sp3 hybrid orbitals. Unlike carbon, however, nitrogen does not form long chains because of repulsive interactions between lone pairs of electrons on adjacent atoms. These interactions become important at the shorter internuclear distances encountered with the smaller, second-period elements of groups 15, 16, and 17. (For more information on internuclear distance, see Chapter 7 \\"The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends\\", Section 7.2 \\"Sizes of Atoms and Ions\\" and Chapter 8 \\"Ionic versus Covalent Bonding\\", Section 8.2 \\"Ionic Bonding\\". ) Stable compounds with N–N bonds are limited to chains of no more than three N atoms, such as the azide ion (N 3−). Nitrogen is the only pnicogen that normally forms multiple bonds with itself and other second-period elements, using π overlap of adjacent np orbitals. Thus the stable form of elemental nitrogen is N 2, whose N≡N bond is so strong (DN≡N = 942 kJ/mol) compared with the N–N and N=N bonds (DN–N = 167 kJ/mol; DN=N = 418 kJ/mol) that all compounds containing N–N and N=N bonds are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the formation of N2. In fact, the formation of the N≡N bond is so thermodynamically favored that virtually all compounds containing N–N bonds are potentially explosive. Again in contrast to carbon, nitrogen undergoes only two important chemical reactions at room temperature: it reacts with metallic lithium to form lithium nitride, and it is reduced to ammonia by certain microorganisms. (For more information lithium, seeChapter 21 \\"Periodic Trends and the \\". ) At higher temperatures, however, N2 reacts with more electropositive elements, such as those in group 13, to give binary nitrides, which range from covalent to ionic in character. Like the corresponding compounds of carbon, binary compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, hydrogen, or other nonmetals are usually covalent molecular...   Choices:  - seven  - five  - three  - four   A: Answer:","output":"four The paragraph states that like carbon, nitrogen also has four valence orbitals which include \\"one 2s and three 2p\\", allowing it to participate in at most \\"four electron-pair bonds by using sp3 hybrid orbitals\\". So, a nitrogen atom can participate in at most four electron-pair bonds. Although nitrogen has the capacity to form long chains like carbon does, it does not do this due to repulsive interactions occurring at shorter distances between lone pairs of electrons on adjacent atoms. Nitrogen's participation in these four bonding situations utilizes its valence orbitals, not exceeding them and thereby asserting that nitrogen can bond in four instances at most. The formation is strong and preferred, such that compounds containing N–N bonds are thermodynamically unstable making nitrogen bonds have a maximum bonding capacity of four. Therefore, the correct option is four."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The new bicycle Jill purchased for herself would not fit through her front doorway, the","output":"handlebars were too wide, and the frame was too bulky, displaying a major obstacle in her plan to safely store it inside. Jill initially didn't expect this problem when she decided to purchase the bicycle. She had been extremely excited about the idea of owning a new bike, one with all the bells and whistles. She fell in love with a particular model, a sleek, stylish bike with a durable design. She admired the spacious saddle, the thick tires designed for both roads and rough trails, and especially the extensive set of gears designed to conquer the most challenging of terrain. The bike also featured wide handlebars that promised a great deal of control - a feature she had been really keen on to help her navigate through city roads. However, she overlooked one crucial detail – the dimensions of her front doorway. In her excitement and anticipation, it didn't cross her mind to measure the bike, nor did she consider the dimensions of her front door, which was not particularly wide. The small space of her apartment also did not cater to large storage. The day she brought the bike home, she found herself facing the said obstacle - the bike wouldn't fit through the front door. The handlebars were too wide, spreading out horizontally beyond the frame of the door. The bulky frame of the bike just added to the problem. She tried angling it differently and even attempted to lift it up at odd angles to make it work. She tried to twist and turn the bike, but this only led to scuff marks on both the walls and the beveled edges of her door, giving her walls a quite distressing array of black and grey marks. The realization hit her then, this new vehicle she had purchased was not designed for small space living. She had been blindsided by her own excitement and anticipation and missed considering the practicality of storing such a big bike inside her home. Unfortunately, she had to rethink her strategies to store her bike which might include disassembling and reassembling the bike whenever she wanted to use or park it, or finding an alternative, secure location outside her apartment for her beloved new means of transportation. Thinking in retrospect, she also wondered if she could have chosen a bike with detachable or adjustable handlebars, or a folding bike which could have made storage significantly easier. As she stood there, contemplating, she realized that what she initially perceived as a minor oversight was actually a substantial, inconvenient hurdle.  So, the statement, \\"The new bicycle Jill purchased for herself would not fit through her front doorway,\\" is a brief tale of an oversight and a good reminder of the importance of considering all practical implications when making a significant purchase. She learned that a thorough investigation should factor in the size, practicality and the ease of use, not just the aesthetics and functionality of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who resented the marriage?  Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognized as a landmark in the devlopment of symphonic form? The answer is:","output":"Sibelius. Jean Sibelius is the composer whose Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognized as a landmark in the development of symphonic form. Sibelius was a Finnish composer and violinist who was particularly known for his contributions to the symphony genre. His works were significant in bridging the gap between Romanticism and 20th-century classical music.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose life will be complete if they have a Jaguar XJ6 and a date with a gorgeous girl?  In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan. He heads out to search the car yards to find his dream machine.

Article:","output":"Title: Kids in Afghanistan War: A Sad Story of Losses Once upon a time in a faraway land called Afghanistan, there were many kids, just like you, who lived with their families. But, there was a big problem in this land: a war was going on. A war is when two or more groups of people fight against each other for a long time and many people can get hurt. In the year 2010, there was a group called the Afghanistan Rights Monitor who was keeping an eye on this war. They found out that during this time, almost 740 kids were killed because of the war. This is just like if every day, two kids would get hurt and not be able to come back home to play with their friends and family. This made everyone very sad. Most of these kids were hurt because of bad people called insurgents, who were fighting against the good people like the US and NATO forces. The US and NATO forces were also responsible for some kids getting hurt, but they didn't want to harm the kids. It's important to remember that these people are trying their best to help, but sometimes accidents can happen. Even though the number of kids getting hurt went down from the year before (in 2009, there were 1,050 kids hurt), the Afghanistan Rights Monitor said it's not okay that this is happening. They believe that the people fighting in the war should do everything they can to make sure kids are safe and sound, just like you are when you're at home with your family. While all of this was going on, there was also something called an air war happening. An air war is when planes fly in the sky and drop bombs on the bad guys. This made the situation even more dangerous for kids living in Afghanistan. Isn't that scary? In conclusion, the war in Afghanistan was a very sad and difficult time, especially for kids who lived there. The Afghanistan Rights Monitor wants everyone to remember how important it is to keep kids like you safe and sound, no matter where they live."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reverend Al Sharpton has been seen with an attractive young woman on his arm at various recent events and according to the woman herself, they're dating. Sharpton, 58, attended the New York County Democratic Committee Award Ceremony on Monday night accompanied by Aisha McShaw, a 35-year-old from Westchester, New York. It's the first relationship Sharpton has made public since the demise of his 24-year marriage to Kathy Jordan in 2004. New couple: Sharpton and McShaw were pictured together in February this year. McShaw told reporters at Monday's event that she is a 'personal stylist'. The New York Daily News reports that when the attractive younger woman was questioned about her relationship to Sharpton, she said, 'I'm his girlfriend,' before being steered away from the reporter by Sharpton. McShaw was wearing a form-fitting black-and-white gown to the ceremony and certainly looked the part of a stylist, though her LinkedIn page describes her as a personal banker at Wells Fargo. Looking sharp: Rev. Al Sharpton cosies up with Aisha McShaw (right) and a friend. Sharpton's new squeeze comes in the wake of his 2004 divorce and 125lb weight loss in 2010. The charismatic activist and preacher scoffs at the idea of a 'reinvention', though. 'I don't evolve, I'm \\"reinvented\\",' he told Roland Martin in 2010. 'Like it's part of some slick strategy.' Amicable: Sharpton and his ex-wife Kathy Jordan, pictured here in 1998, divorced in 2004. Sharpton attributes his dramatic weight loss to a change of diet and says he doesn't eat meat, but has fish twice a week and lots of fruit and vegetables. He and McShaw have been seen together at black-tie events around the country over the past few months. Evolved: (left) Sharpton with his daughters in 2004 and (right) discussing planned 'Justice for Trayvon' vigils in 100 cities across the U.S. yesterday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman. The well-coiffed host of MSNBC's PoliticsNation is usually outspoken but has remained tight-lipped about his love-life. After the decline of Sharpton's marriage, a spokesperson said he and ex-wife Jordan had simply grown apart. The split was said to be amicable.

Answer the following question: This article: Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court. contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who died in prison?, what is it ?

Then, with a sigh, he said, \\"I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed. It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness. My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it. The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it. If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.\\" \\"Of course we will fetch you the stone,\\" Nepthys assured him. \\"You have our thanks.\\" Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone. He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street, and we set off. When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant. Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys. Nepthys didn't need to warn me not to speak to them. He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d's light, and handcuffed. Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions. Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive. A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us. \\"Good evening, gentlemen,\\" she said. \\"May I invite you to have a cup of tea?\\" \\"No, thank you,\\" said Nepthys, \\"we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?\\" \\"Yes,\\" answered the woman. \\"I am Madame Entera, at your service.

For sale: Crumbling castle with commanding views of Lake Winnipesaukee and the threat of a wrecking ball in its near future. Kimball Castle in Gilford, New Hampshire, U.S. - built by a wealthy railroad baron - is a shell of its former self and now up for sale for 799,000. Once stunning in its grandeur and featured on postcards, the castle has long been neglected and is deemed by town officials to be 'an unattractive nuisance' and an 'extreme hazard'. Scroll down for video. Under threat: Kimball Castle, built in the late 1890s for Benjamin Ames Kimball, who was president of the Boston-Montreal Railroad, is under the threat of a wrecking ball in its near future. The dilapidated manor has fallen into such a state that it even featured on an episode of U.S. 'Ghost Hunters' a few years ago. The Gilford Board of Selectmen earlier this year approved demolition by its owner - Kimball Castle Properties LLC. The property is bound by a number of restrictive covenants that make prospects of finding a buyer bleak. Town Administrator Scott Dunn said the only thing a buyer could do with it is construct a 40-room inn and 75-seat restaurant - based on conditions attached to another prospective development plan from 1996. That plan failed to attract enough financial backing to go forward. 'Anything else would take agreement by the Attorney General, the selectmen and the court,' Dunn said. Backdrop: Commanding stunning views of Lake Winnipesaukee, the 19th century castle has been left to rot and ruin and has lost most of its windows and frames. The medieval-styled castle was built. in the late 1890s by Benjamin Ames Kimball, who was president of the. Boston, Montreal and Concord railways and had also served as president. of several Concord banks. He designed the two-story granite edifice. after castles he'd seen on Germany's Rhine River. Much. of the stone was quarried from Locke's Hill, atop which the castle sits. on 20 acres. Until his death in 1920 at age 86, Kimball liked to sit on. his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of Lake Winnipesaukee. known as 'the broads'. No. Kimball has lived in the castle since Benjamin Kimball's daughter-in-law. died in 1960. She left the estate and about 400,000 to a charitable. foundation, with the stipulation it create a nature preserve on the site. and that the property not be used for commercial development. Halcyon days: Until his death in 1920 at age 86, Kimball liked to sit on his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of Lake Winnipesaukee known as 'the broads' The preserve was never created, the money vanished and, in 1981, New Hampshire's Attorney General took control of the land and offered it to the town of Gilford to create the preserve and save the castle. By then, scarred and stripped of much. of its woodwork by vandals, the castle was already badly deteriorated. Trespassers had left doors and windows open. The atrium skylight was. destroyed and water had been pouring into the structure for years. In. 1980, then-town administrator Steve McCabe predicted, \\"It's going to be. the wrecking ball for the castle\\" unless someone steps in to save it. No one did. Gilford. residents did not want to spend the money to reverse the castle's. decay. Town administrators convinced the Attorney General's office that. the only way to save the castle was to permit commercial development. The principle investors in the 1996 project — David and Mary Jodoin —. are the sole partners in the Kimball Castle Properties LLC. The property was listed for sale in 2010 for the dearer price of 995,000 but it seems the owners will now accept a lower offer since it is scheduled to be demolished. They not only received approval to raze the castle, but were ordered to by the town's building inspector, David Andrade. The deadline was May 15, but the Jodoins have been granted two extensions — and now have until Oct. 15 — to demolish the castle and several buildings. 'Although it is very painful for me to impose this order on you as the castle holds historic and sentimental value to the community,' Andrade wrote, 'due to the extreme hazards it presents, I find it necessary to protect the safety of all.' The Board of Selectmen is holding a public hearing Wednesday on changes in the deed proposed by the owners, including ending the public's right to access the property.

He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  But I can use this background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  What is an answer for this question: Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Answer:","output":"Item A, the Earth, would have a higher specific gravity compared to Item B, the surface rock. The Earth's mean specific gravity is 5.515, which is significantly higher than the typical specific gravity of surface rocks (Item B), which ranges between 2.7–3.3. This higher specific gravity in the Earth indicates that the deeper material is denser than surface rocks. The difference in specific gravity cannot be solely attributed to the pressure inside the Earth, as the effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation and it has been concluded that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: In prefix = st1 /America, drivers' education is part of regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead, it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practise driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practise starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two-hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \\"driver\\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Under-reporting of Northern Ireland lets chief constable off the hook News that the Northern Ireland assembly is facing suspension will surely have taken people in England, Wales and Scotland by surprise. Very little about the reason for the political crisis has appeared in the London-based national press, but it has been front page news in Ireland, north and south, for a couple of weeks. So, before I continue, you need to know that the story began with the murder on 12 August of a former IRA member, Kevin McGuigan. The Guardian’s Irish correspondent, Henry McDonald, immediately reported that the killing had “the potential to destabilise the already fragile power-sharing coalition at the devolved parliament in Stormont.” Why? Because it was suggested that McGuigan had been killed by former IRA members as a retaliation for McGuigan having murdered another former senior IRA member, Gerard Davison, in early May. That killing, also reported by McDonald, got almost no mention elsewhere. Ten days later, a statement by the head of Northern Ireland’s police service (PSNI), George Hamilton, set the story alight. He said the Provisional IRA still existed and that individual members had been involved in killing McGuigan. But Hamilton also said the IRA’s leadership had not sanctioned McGuigan’s murder. He was quoted as saying: “Some of the PIRA structure from the 1990s remains broadly in place, although its purpose has radically changed since this period.” Aside from the Guardian, most of the UK papers that bothered to cover Hamilton’s intervention, relied on Press Association copy: Daily Telegraph examples here on 21 August and on the following day. The Independent carried a short report on 23 August, which was clearly no more than rewritten agency copy, and a longer piece, “They haven’t gone away you know”, the following Saturday (not online).* The Times did not catch up with the story’s significance until 24 August with a piece by its new Irish political editor, Niamh Lyons, in which she reported that Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin president, had been forced to deny that the IRA is still in operation for the second time in three days. Adams also said the murders of Davison and McGuigan were being used “opportunistically and cynically” to attack Sinn Féin. Some four days later, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUO), Mike Nesbitt, threatened to pull out of the five-party ruling coalition at Stormont. The predicted power-sharing crisis was on its way. By this time, newspapers across the island of Ireland were carrying articles in which commentators argued about whether or not the IRA existed. But there was no such analysis in the UK. The under-reporting of Northern Ireland politics, increasingly evident over recent years after national papers withdrew their correspondents, means that the people who ultimately hold the fate of those six Irish counties in their hands (British voters) are denied relevant information. It also means that the actors involved in the drama escape from the necessary scrutiny that is the hallmark of Britain’s national press when dealing with major stories. For a start, I cannot imagine any British-based chief constable getting away with such an ambivalent statement as that made by the PSNI’s Hamilton without being subjected to intense daily pressure to explain himself. He set unionism’s political hares running with a confusing set of allegations that required relentless journalistic questioning. By forcing him to be more transparent it is possible that there would be no political crisis. He was, in effect, let off the hook. By saying the IRA still exists he must have known the likely outcome. It was manna from heaven for unionists who dislike sharing power with Sinn Féin. Where was Hamilton’s evidence? Even if we accept that he is right in saying that former IRA members were responsible for McGuigan’s murder, in what way does that prove the organisation itself exists? Following Hamilton’s inept statement Sinn Féin has found itself in an impossible position: how do you prove a negative? Their spokespeople have routinely said that the IRA doesn’t exist in the face of interviewers quoting Hamilton’s claim that “the structure” exists. The nonsense continued today (Wednesday) with the Times’s leading article, It is time for Sinn Fein to complete the dismantling of the Provisionals. The paper said: “It must be evident to all by now that the residual elements of the Provisional IRA, still enjoying contacts with Sinn Fein, have to be properly disowned and cast into well-deserved obscurity. There is only so much longer that a democratic party can run with the fox and hunt with the hounds.” Why is that nonsense? Well, given that unionists (and supportive British politicians and newspapers) are predisposed not to believe in Sinn Féin’s claim that the IRA was disbanded long ago and no longer exists, how could the party ever convince anyone that it has “properly disowned” is former military wing? It does not take us any further forward. Again, the lack of interest from UK newspapers (allied to their anti-republican agenda) allows unionists to escape criticism for their stance. In what way does collapsing Stormont change the situation? Direct rule would not change matters. Sinn Féin would go on saying the IRA didn’t exist. If there were to be new assembly elections, with every likelihood that voters would return the same parties to Stormont in similar numbers, the situation wouldn’t change. How can Sinn Féin convince those who refuse to believe it that the IRA has gone away for ever? The black irony is that the only way it could possibly “control” former members bent on criminal behaviour is by reforming the IRA to bring them to heel. Finally, I must mention a column published last Friday in the Irish edition of the Daily Mirror by Pat Flanagan. He derided the leaders of two Irish parties - Labour’s Joan Burton and Fianna Fail’s Micheál Martin - by arguing that they had “scrambled aboard the McGuigan murder bandwagon”. He accused them of ignoring other murders in the Republic because there was “no political mileage to be made from their deaths” and added: “Also there wasn’t the same reaction from this pair when 16-year-old Phoebe Clawson was seriously injured after a loyalist drove his car into a crowd during the Twelfth ‘celebrations’. The alleged driver, John Aughey, who has been charged with attempted murder [which he denies], is a leading member of the Orange Order which, unlike Sinn Féin, doesn’t pose a political threat to Labour or Fianna Fail, so the bandwagon remained in the garage.” It reminded me that Phoebe Clawson’s ordeal had been widely overlooked also by the British press. A quick search reveals that few papers even covered the story. Yet again, the perils of the under-reporting of Northern Ireland mean that there is no press pressure on organisations, such as the Orange Order, that have definitely not gone away. Full disclosure: I have written in the past for the Sinn Féin newspaper, An Phoblacht *This paragraph was amended on 6 September to take account of the second Independent article which, as stated, was not accessible online. Summary:","output":"Recent political crisis in Northern Ireland has been largely overlooked by the UK press, with the full story being largely unknown to those outside of Ireland. The crisis began with the murder of a former IRA member, Kevin McGuigan, on 12 August, which sparked dialogue suggesting that the IRA still existed and was involved in illegal activities. The head of Northern Ireland's police service, George Hamilton, confirmed these rumours but stated that the IRA's leadership hadn't authorised the murder, tipping Northern Ireland into political turmoil. This lack of UK press coverage is said to have saved key political figures from scrutiny and has left the broader public ill-informed about the political state of Northern Ireland. Hamilton's statement, which necessitates further transparency, initiated a crisis that could have been avoided with more thorough questioning, according to the story."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Rania Al-Abdullah (Arabic: rny l\`bd llh, Raniya al-\`Abd Allah; born Rania Al-Yassin on 31 August 1970) is the queen consort of Jordan. Born in Kuwait to a Palestinian family, she later moved to Jordan for work, where she met the then prince Abdullah. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. In November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children. In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI).  As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. One of the stories in the book, \\"Maha of the Mountains\\", was contributed by Queen Rania. In Soweto, she was the first to write her name in the back of the Big Read, before passing it on to everyone else to write their name.  During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch \\"The Big Read\\" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.  On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the \\"1GOAL: Education for All\\" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world's biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education. On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide. Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this \\"tragedy into triumph\\" and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments.  In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, \\"End Poverty - Be the Generation,\\" which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.

Possible answers: - negative. - positive.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be identified as positive. The text of the tweet is sharing various activities the person has been doing or plans to do, all of which seem to be presenting positive information. Starting from the haircut, which is often associated with self-care and beautification, this user is likely feeling good about their physical appearance. Moreover, a haircut could also signify changes and transformations taking place in the person's life, which are generally perceived to be positive especially if following the individual's personal choice. The cleaning of the pool can be seen as another positive aspect. It indicates that the user has a pool, which is often considered a luxury, and has had it cleaned most possibly in anticipation of using it. This implies leisure, relaxation, and possibly fitness activities, all of which create a positive sentiment.  The mention of a shower further adds to this sentiment, creating an image of refreshment and cleanliness. Showers are generally associated with a positive feeling and can also denote taking time for personal care, thus contributing to the positive sentiment. The final phrase, \\"galaaa with Kate\\", represents social interaction, which is often associated with happiness and joy. \\"Gala\\" could mean a party, an outing, or a get-together, which implies fun and enjoyment. Mentioning a certain 'Kate' implies a level of excitement towards hanging out with her, suggesting that they have a good and positive relationship. This strengthens the overall positive sentiment of the tweet. Therefore, considering all these factors, the sentiment expressed in the tweet seems to be overwhelmingly positive.

Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.  - Cologne is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth-largest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany, with more than ten million inhabitants.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people.

Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Munich (also in British English ) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Bavaria, on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe?

Within NPC's ratio, the NPC is the director of the conference with the highest ranking of the ensemble of the lecture, the group. To rush a sorority, the first step is to understand the Greek system. The primary governing body for the major female Greek system is the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), which is composed of 26 member organizations. These organizations include various sororities that represent a wide range of interests and values. It is important to note that there are additional sororities that may be regional or specific to certain schools, but the NPC is the central hub for national sorority discussions and governance. When participating in the sorority recruitment process (also referred to as \\"rushing\\"), potential new members should familiarize themselves with the unique traits and values of each of the sorority chapters on their campus. This will allow them to make an informed decision about which organization aligns best with their own values and interests. Rushing a sorority typically involves attending various recruitment events organized by the sororities during a specific recruitment period. These events may include open houses, information sessions, philanthropic activities, and social gatherings designed to introduce potential new members to the sorority and its current members. Through these events, you will have the chance to interact with members and other potential new members, learn more about each organization's specific values and expectations, and get a sense of the overall vibe and personality of each sorority. While attending recruitment events, it's important to be yourself and engage with the members and other potential new members genuinely and honestly. Participate in conversations, ask questions, and listen to others' experiences to gain a better understanding of each organization. Also, remember to have an open mind as you attend these events, as your initial perceptions of each sorority may change as you get to know them. After the recruitment period ends, you may receive a bid (an invitation) to join a sorority. It's crucial to weigh your options carefully and ultimately choose an organization whose values, interests, and members align best with your own personality and ideals. In conclusion, rushing a sorority requires a thorough understanding of the Greek system and the NPC, as well as a sincere effort to engage with various sororities during the recruitment process to find the best fit for you. Through open-minded exploration, genuine connection, and reflection, you can successfully find a sorority to call home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To do this, use a tool like Rufus (for Windows) or Unetbootin (for Linux, Windows, and macOS). Run the tool and select the downloaded Clonezilla ISO file and your desired destination drive. Click \\"Start\\" to create your bootable Clonezilla media. Step 2: Boot from the Clonezilla media Insert the bootable media into the computer you wish to clone or image. Reboot the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI to change the boot sequence. Set the bootable media as the first boot device and save your settings. Your computer should now boot from the Clonezilla media. Step 3: Start Clonezilla Live You'll be presented with the Clonezilla Live splash screen. Choose your preferred language and wait for the Clonezilla Live environment to load. Select \\"Start Clonezilla\\" and proceed. You can choose from \\"Device-image\\" for disk image management and \\"Device-device\\" for disk cloning. Step 4: Choose Mode If you selected \\"Device-image,\\" you'd need to specify the location to save or load the image files, such as a local or external drive, a network share, or even an SSH server. If you selected \\"Device-device,\\" you'd be prompted to choose the source and target drives for cloning. Step 5: Select Source and Target For disk imaging, select the source disk that you wish to backup and the location to save the image. For disk cloning, select the source disk and the target disk, ensuring that the target disk is larger or the same size as the source disk. Step 6: Choose imaging or cloning options Select between beginners and expert mode. Beginners mode provides default settings, while expert mode allows for more advanced settings. Select the desired image format (compressed or uncompressed) and choose from the available partition and drive formats, like MBR/UEFI or NTFS/FAT32. Step 7: Confirm and start the process Before starting the process, Clonezilla will display a summary of your chosen options. Review them carefully and, if everything is correct, press \\"Enter\\" to start the disk imaging or cloning process. Clonezilla will provide progress updates during the process, including an estimated time of completion. Step 8: Shut down or reboot the system Once Clonezilla has finished the disk imaging or cloning process, you can either shut down the computer or reboot it. If you're restoring an image, reboot the computer after removing the bootable media. Now you've successfully used Clonezilla to clone or image a disk. Remember to keep your disk image updated periodically to protect your data against hardware failure or other issues. Store the backup files securely, and don't forget to restore and test your disk image to ensure it's working correctly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

The campaign has been supported by more than 1.7 million people worldwide.","output":"Title: The Struggle of Maasai in Tanzania: A Fight for Their Traditional Land Introduction: The Maasai, a semi-nomadic tribe inhabiting Tanzania and Kenya, have a rich history with a distinct culture deeply rooted in their traditional lands. However, the Maasai in Loliondo, Tanzania, are currently facing the threat of eviction from the very land that holds their identity together. This article will shed light on the challenges faced by the Maasai in Loliondo and their relentless efforts to secure their ancestral rights. Step One: Background on the Tanzanian government's threats to the Maasai Start by providing the context of the Tanzanian government’s threats to the Maasai community. The article should explain the reasons behind the government’s decision to forcibly evict the Maasai from their traditional lands, which could be due to various socio-political and economic factors. Is it because of conservation efforts, economic development, or any other reason? This information will help justify the government's actions, whether or not we agree with them. Step Two: Maasai tribes in Loliondo campaigning to stay on their land The Maasai’s determination to remain on their ancestries is evident through their activism and petitions. Detail the strategies and events undertaken in their campaign, as well as their reception within Tanzania and beyond its borders. It will be essential to emphasize how the Maasai have successfully engaged with supporters worldwide, who believe in the tribe's right to live on their ancestral land. Step Three: Worldwide Support for the Maasai Campaign 1.7 million people have joined the Maasai in their fight to secure their rights through numerous online and offline campaigns. This section should highlight the overwhelming global support the Maasai have received from various individuals and organizations. This figure validates their struggle and can potentially influence public opinion on the issue. Step Four: Discuss the implications of eviction on the Maasai community Explain the potential consequences of eviction for the Maasai people, their way of life, and their culture. Discuss how the Maasai's cultural and spiritual identity is intrinsically tied to their ancestral lands and how losing them would severely impact the tribe's future generations. Step Five: Propose potential solutions and dialogue between the Tanzanian government and the Maasai Suggest various ways through which the two parties can engage in open dialogue and reach a mutually beneficial agreement without compromising the well-being of the Maasai people or their traditional lands.

Does the sentence \\"Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\" answer the question \\"Among which builders was the Gothic style first used?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\" does not answer the question, \\"Among which builders was the Gothic style first used?\\" The sentence simply provides information about the use of stained glass and wall-paintings in churches, but it does not mention the Gothic style specifically or the builders who first utilized it. To answer the question \\"Among which builders was the Gothic style first used?\\", I would offer the following detailed explanation: The Gothic style primarily originated in northern France around the 12th century and is attributed to the rise of the French royal domain and the powerful abbey of Saint-Denis. It is widely believed that the first use of Gothic architecture was in the construction of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, located north of Paris. Abbot Suger, a French clergyman, statesman, and historian, is credited as a crucial figure in the development of the Gothic style, as he oversaw the renovations of the church. Abbot Suger's vision entailed vast interiors filled with light, expressing spiritual values through the beauty of his architectural design, which led to the inclusion of key elements that defined the Gothic style, such as rib vaults, pointed arches, and large windows filled with stained glass. The renovation and expansion of the Basilica of Saint-Denis between 1137 and 1144 by an unknown group of builders and architects marked the beginning of the Gothic architectural style. As the Gothic style gained popularity, other churches and cathedrals in Europe began incorporating these innovative features. Master builders and architects such as Villard de Honnecourt, Robert of Luzarches, Thomas of Cormont, and Pierre de Montreuil played significant roles in further developing and disseminating Gothic architecture across the continent. The Gothic style soon spread to other French cathedrals, like Notre-Dame de Paris, Amiens, and Chartres. The style was later adopted and modified by builders in other European countries, including Germany, England, Spain, and Italy. In conclusion, the Gothic style emerged among builders in the northern region of France in the 12th century, specifically with the renovations of the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Figures such as Abbot Suger and architects like Villard de Honnecourt were influential in the development and spread of the style, which eventually became a widely popular architectural style used in the construction of churches across Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Designed by Lotus legend Colin Chapman and built in 1968, the iconic car is one of only a handful of 49s still in existence. Classics: The car is expected to fetch as much as £1million at auction. Restored: The car was badly damaged in the 1970s, but was restored by previous owner John Dawson-Damer. Champion: The car was raced by Formula One legend Graham Hill. It is the last Lotus to be sold from the collection of late British racer John Dawson-Damer. Dawson-Damer tragically died when he crashed his 1969 Lotus 63 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2000. The car is expected to draw interest from collectors at the Bonhams’ sale at the same Goodwood festival in June. James Knight, Bonhams group motoring director, said: 'By every standard, Colin Chapman’s Lotus 49 concept is an absolute landmark in Formula One design.

Hill won his second Formula One world championship title in 1968 for Gold Leaf Team Lotus in the improved 49B type. After ending its racing days in South Africa in 1972, the car was badly damaged by the time it was bought by Dawson-Damer. He painstakingly restored it to race-worthy condition. Dawson-Damer’s six other Lotus Formula One cars sold in a Sydney auction for a total of £1.2million in 2008.

But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via  SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps  , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time. These apps allow people to send picture messages for free--something which previously was quite costly. Research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps in 2012, compared with 17. 6 billion SMS texts. And it expects the chat app market to grow t0 50 billion per day by 2014. So does this really mean the end for communication by text? Pamela Clark--Dickson from Informa doesn't think so. She says that there are a large number of people who use normal mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, who prefer the SMS messaging tool.

Passenger had heard a squeaking noise from under a seat. Plane was delayed as women was taken off.","output":"Title: Sneaky Yorkie Causes Flight Delay at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport Once upon a time, a little dog named Yorkie wanted to go on an adventure. Its owner, a woman, tried to sneak Yorkie past the security guards at a big airport called Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. The airport is a place where big machines, called airplanes, take people from one place to another.  As they got on the plane, Yorkie was very quiet, and they were able to get to their seat without anyone noticing. But little Yorkie couldn't stay still for long! Inside the airplane, Yorkie started moving around under a seat and started making tiny squeaking noises like a little toy.  Another passenger on the plane heard the squeaking noise and became curious. They wondered what could be making such a sound, so they started looking around. When they found Yorkie, they realized that a dog was not supposed to be on the plane without permission! The airport staff were notified, and they had to stop the airplane from taking off. This means, the plane couldn't start flying yet because it's not safe to have a sneaky dog on board. The woman, who tried to bring Yorkie on the plane, was asked to leave with her dog. This caused a delay, and everyone had to wait a little bit longer before they could fly to their destination. In the end, Yorkie and its owner had to find another way to travel, while the other passengers continued on their journey. It was a very exciting day at the Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, and everyone learned that sneaking pets onto airplanes is not a good idea because it can cause problems for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. public debt was 909 billion in 1980, an amount equal to 33% of Americas gross domestic product (GDP); by 1990, that number had more than tripled to 3.2 trillion—or 56% of GDP. In 2001 the national debt was 5.7 trillion; however, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained at 1990 levels. Debt levels rose quickly in the following decade, and on January 28, 2010, the U.S. debt ceiling was raised to 14.3 trillion. Based on the 2010 United States federal budget, total national debt will grow to nearly 100% of GDP, versus a level of approximately 80% in early 2009.

With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Deitch Projects is a contemporary art gallery in New York City founded by Jeffrey Deitch .

Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River.

This is a common and controversial topic in urban planning. Gentrification may be viewed as a \\"correction\\" of blockbusting and urban flight, as many gentrified neighborhoods of the present were once affluent neighborhoods of the past.  - Long Island City (L.I.C.) is the westernmost residential and commercial neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens. L.I.C. is noted for its rapid and ongoing residential growth and gentrification, its waterfront parks, and its thriving arts community.

It separates the borough of Queens on Long Island from the Bronx on the North American mainland, and also divides Manhattan from Queens and Brooklyn, which is also on Long Island. Because of its connection to Long Island Sound, it was once also known as the \\"Sound River\\". The tidal strait changes its direction of flow frequently, and is subject to strong fluctuations in its current, which are accentuated by its narrowness and variety of depths. The waterway is navigable for its entire length of , and was historically the center of maritime activities in the city, although that is no longer the case.  - The Queensboro Bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge  because its Manhattan end is located between 59th and 60th Streets  and officially titled the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, is a cantilever bridge over the East River in New York City that was completed in 1909. It connects the neighborhood of Long Island City in the borough of Queens with Manhattan, passing over Roosevelt Island. It carries New York State Route 25 and is the westernmost of the four East River spans that carry a route number: NY 25 terminates at the west (Manhattan) side of the bridge, which once carried NY 24 and NY 25A as well. The bridge is flanked on its northern side by the freestanding Roosevelt Island Tramway. The bridge was, for a long time, simply called the Queensboro Bridge, but in March 2011, the bridge was officially renamed in honor of former New York City mayor Ed Koch.  - Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County further east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,339,150 residents in 2015, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn.

From this statement, it is clear that the cause of the individual's overwhelm was the sudden showing up of the user.  Step 1: Analyze the task: Here, we are asked to identify the reason why the individual in question was overwhelmed.  Step 2: Review the options provided: Four options have been given: \\"Because I grabbed his visitors journal\\", \\"Because I suddenly showed up\\", \\"None of the above choices\\" and \\"Because I said what I had to say quickly.\\" Step 3: Compare each option with the information given: - Option 1 refers to grabbing a visitors journal which is an action that happened after the individual was already overwhelmed. So, this cannot be the cause. - Option 2 refers to suddenly showing up which is indeed mentioned in the user's text as the reason for the overwhelm. - Option 3 suggests that none of the choices apply which is not the case here since Option 2 is a clear match. - Option 4 is about quickly saying something. Although it was part of the sequence of events, it wasn't mentioned as the cause of the overwhelm. Step 4: Finalize the response: Based on this comparison, it is evident that the correct answer is \\"Because I suddenly showed up\\". Justification: The user's text specifically indicates that the overwhelm was due to \\"us suddenly showing up\\", directly matching with Option 2.

It is part of the Finno-Ugric language family. The sentence structure in Finnish can seem complicated initially to English speakers as the verb usually comes at the end of the sentence and words can appear look 'lengthier' due to the additional modifying particles attached to the word stems.  The word-for-word translation of \\"En usko, että tämä on oikea tapa, jolla parlamentin pitäisi toimia maatalouteen liittyvissä asioissa, mutta tiedän, että harhautun tässä aiheesta.\\" can be dissected like this: \\"En usko\\" - I do not believe. \\"että\\" - that. \\"tämä on\\" - this is. \\"oikea tapa\\" - the right way. \\"jolla parlamentin pitäisi toimia\\" - for which Parliament should operate. \\"maatalouteen liittyvissä asioissa\\" - in matters relating to agriculture. \\"mutta\\" - but. \\"tiedän\\" - I know. \\"että\\" - that. \\"harhautun tässä aiheesta\\" - I am digressing on this topic.

Question: what is bracketing in photography I found the following answer on Google: In photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but I can provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation. Bracketing in photography refers to the process of taking multiple images of the same subject or scene, using different camera settings to capture a range of exposures. This technique is particularly useful in challenging lighting conditions, where it can be difficult to determine the optimal exposure settings to capture the desired details and tones. By capturing a series of images at different exposure levels, photographers can select the best shot or merge multiple exposures to create a well-balanced final image. There are various types of bracketing, including: 1. Exposure Bracketing (AEB): The most common form of bracketing, Exposure Bracketing, involves taking a series of photos at different exposure levels – usually one underexposed, one correctly exposed, and one overexposed. This is achieved by adjusting the shutter speed, aperture, or ISO settings. Many digital cameras offer an auto exposure bracketing (AEB) mode, automating the process and allowing photographers to capture a sequence of bracketed images in rapid succession. 2. Focus Bracketing: In focus bracketing, a series of images are taken with different focus points, allowing the photographer to selectively choose the sharpest image or to combine multiple images with varying focus points to create a final image with extended depth of field. This technique is particularly useful in macro photography, where the depth of field is often shallow, and landscapes, where both foreground and background elements need to be in focus. 3. White Balance Bracketing: White balance bracketing involves capturing a series of images with different white balance settings to ensure accurate colors in the final image. This can be useful when shooting in mixed lighting conditions or when the correct white balance is uncertain. 4. Flash Bracketing: Flash bracketing is the process of taking a series of images with varying flash output levels to achieve the desired amount of fill light or flash exposure. This technique can help photographers balance the ambient light with artificial light sources. 5. ISO Bracketing: In ISO bracketing, multiple images are captured with different ISO settings, allowing photographers to compare noise levels and choose the image with an ideal balance between image brightness and noise reduction. Bracketing can be a helpful technique in digital photography, as it allows photographers to explore different creative possibilities, ensure accurate exposure, and minimize shooting errors. With post-processing software like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, photographers can combine bracketed images using techniques like HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing and focus stacking to create visually stunning, well-exposed, and sharp images."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Informativeness: The review is not very informative as it does not provide any specific details about the subject or its features. Readers would be unable to determine what makes the item or experience \\"cool\\" or whether it meets their needs and expectations. Considering the lack of information provided, I would rate the review a 1 in this aspect. 2. Engagement: The review, while brief, does convey a positive sentiment. The word \\"cool\\" may be sufficient to pique some readers' curiosity about the item or experience being reviewed. However, the review is still very vague and may not leave a lasting impression on readers. Therefore, it receives a 2 in terms of engagement. 3. Clarity: The review is concise with its one-word adjective, making it immediately clear that the reviewer had a positive opinion on the subject. However, this succinctness also leaves much to be desired, as it fails to clarify the reasons behind this sentiment. I would rate it a 3 for clarity. 4. Relevance: Finally, considering relevance, the review contains no direct references to the subject being reviewed, making it almost impossible for readers to relate the feedback to any specific item or experience. This ambiguity reduces the review's efficacy in providing helpful information. I would give it a 1 for relevance. Taking these factors into consideration, the average score for this review would be (1+2+3+1)/4 = 1.75. Since ratings are given on a scale of 1 to 5, I would round up the score to 2.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to cook pasta","output":"To cook pasta, follow these detailed steps to ensure you achieve perfectly cooked, delicious results every time: 1. Choose the right pasta: Select the type and shape of pasta that is suitable for the recipe you have in mind. There are several types of pasta, such as spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, penne, fusilli, farfalle, and many more. Each type of pasta varies in shape and size, which impacts its cooking time and how it will hold the sauce. 2. Measure the pasta: Measure the appropriate amount of pasta you need for your dish. A general guideline is about 2 ounces (56 grams) of dried pasta per person for a main course and 1 ounce (28 grams) for a side dish or appetizer. 3. Fill a large pot with water: Fill a large pot with plenty of cold water (around 4 to 6 quarts per pound of pasta) to ensure the pasta has enough room to cook without sticking together.  4. Add salt: Heavily season the water with kosher salt or sea salt (not table salt). The recommended amount is 1 to 2 tablespoons of salt per pound of pasta. The salt will flavor the pasta and help the sauce adhere better. 5. Bring the water to a boil: Place the pot on high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. A rolling boil is characterized by large bubbles that only get larger, even after stirring the water. 6. Add the pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the measured pasta gradually to the boiling water. Stir gently with a wooden spoon or a pasta fork to prevent the pasta from sticking together or to the bottom of the pot. 7. Set the cooking time: Check the pasta package for recommended cooking times, and set a timer accordingly. Cooking times can vary based on the type and thickness of the pasta. Note that fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta, typically in just 2 to 4 minutes. 8. Stir occasionally: As the pasta cooks, gently stir it every couple of minutes to prevent sticking. This is especially important during the first few minutes when the pasta is softening and adjusting to the boiling water. 9. Test for doneness: About 2 minutes before the recommended cooking time, start checking the pasta for doneness. Take a piece out using a slotted spoon or a fork, allow it to cool for a few seconds, and then taste it. The pasta should be cooked al dente - tender but with a slight bite in the middle. Be careful not to overcook, as overcooked pasta becomes mushy. 10. Reserve pasta water: Before draining the pasta, reserve at least a cup of the pasta cooking water. This starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency of your sauce, as well as help the sauce better adhere to the pasta. 11. Drain the pasta: Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the pasta into a colander placed in the sink. Give the colander a gentle shake to remove excess water, but avoid rinsing the pasta unless you are making a cold pasta salad. 12. Combine with sauce: Immediately transfer the drained pasta back to the pot or to a pan with your prepared sauce. Toss the pasta and sauce gently to coat the pasta evenly. If needed, add some reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency. 13. Serve and enjoy: Plate the pasta and sauce, garnish according to your recipe preferences (such as with grated cheese or chopped herbs), and serve immediately. Pasta tastes best when served hot and fresh. Follow these steps, and you will successfully cook pasta that is flavorful and satisfying for any meal or occasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jan filed for a divorce later that month.  Given the context: How would Jan feel after?  Possible answers: like a unhappy person, like a free person, upset","output":"To determine how Jan would feel after filing for a divorce, let's analyze the given context step by step. Step 1: Identify the context - Jan and her husband are not getting along well. This suggests that there is friction or unhappiness in their relationship. The fact that Jan has taken the significant step to file for a divorce indicates that she likely views the situation as unsustainable or unresolvable. Step 2: Examine the possible answers - unhappy, free, and upset. a) Unhappy - The relationship itself may have made Jan unhappy, but it is not clear if the act of filing for a divorce would make her feel more or less unhappy. b) Free - Filing for a divorce could potentially liberate Jan from a relationship that she found oppressive. So, this answer acknowledges a feeling of relief and newfound freedom after taking the step. c) Upset - Although Jan may be upset about the overall situation or her failed marriage, it does not necessarily pinpoint how she feels after filing for a divorce. Step 3: Justify the chosen answer. Based on the context, it seems that Jan has reached a point where she believes that a divorce is necessary. A reasonable assumption would be that after filing for a divorce, she would probably feel \\"like a free person.\\" This is because she has taken a critical step to extract herself from a relationship that was causing her unhappiness.  Keep in mind that emotions are often complex, and Jan could feel a mixture of emotions, including relief, freedom, sadness, and anxiety about the unknown future. However, given the context and available answer choices, \\"like a free person\\" best represents how Jan might feel after filing for a divorce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The former “Daily Show” host told David Axelrod at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics that he isn’t even sure the presumptive Republican nominee is eligible for the presidency.      “I’m not a constitutional scholar, so I can’t necessarily say, but are you eligible to run if you are a man-baby, or a baby-man?” Stewart said during a taping of Axelrod’s podcast “The Axe Files.” “He has the physical countenance of a man and a baby’s temperament and hands.”      Story Continued Below      Stewart went on to describe Trump as thin-skinned and an “unrepentant, narcissistic a--hole.” And he mocked Trump’s campaign slogan. “When was America great? What is this time that he speaks of? ’81 to ’82? Like what are we talking about? And who took your country away from you?” he said.      But the comedian didn’t exactly have nice words for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, either, calling her a “very bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I’m not even sure what they are.”      \\"That is not to say that she is not preferable to Donald Trump because, at this point, I would vote for Mr. T over Donald Trump,\\" he said.      Stewart had some harsh words for the candidates' political parties as well. While the Republican Party's \\"sole purpose is to freeze the government and to not fix any of the problems that are associated with it,” the Democratic Party has failed to make government more efficient and opened the door to a Trump candidacy, he said.      He also criticized the media's coverage of the 2016 campaigns, saying the relationship between journalists and politicians is no longer one of \\"predator and prey\\" but of remora and shark. Stewart said 24-hour networks amplify voices that are \\"the most conflict-oriented, the most extreme,\\" and Trump's strategy has been the same as Jonny Fairplay's on \\"Survivor.\\"      After he got into a back-and-forth with Axelrod about the role and efficiency of government, Stewart praised the comedians who have done segments on the 2016 race, including John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Larry Wilmore.      \\"I am so impressed and amazed at the level of insight and wit that is displayed on television every day,\\" Stewart said. \\"There is no dearth.\\"      And his advice for young people interested in getting into politics?      \\"Get into it, and don’t get it on you,” he said.       ||||| To find more of \\"The Axe Files with David Axelrod,\\" check out podcast.cnn.com/the-axe-files-david-axelrod/      (CNN) Jon Stewart launched a stinging new round of criticism against Donald Trump on Monday, calling the presumptive Republican presidential nominee a thin-skinned hypocrite who ridicules political rivals and minorities but implodes when faced with even a minor slight.      \\"He is a man-baby,\\" Stewart told David Axelrod during a live taping of \\"The Axe Files,\\" a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \\"He has the physical countenance of a man and a baby's temperament and hands. ...

Write an article based on this summary: Have a veterinary check up. Neuter your cat. Seek medications.","output":"Title: The Triad of Feline Healthcare: Veterinary Checkups, Neutering, and Medications Introduction Cats are remarkable creatures that have garnered the adoration of many animal enthusiasts around the world. With their artful hunting abilities and charming personalities, they have become cherished companions to millions of households. However, as a responsible pet owner, it is essential to understand the importance of maintaining the health of your feline friend. At the core of feline healthcare is a triad of essential practices: regular veterinary checkups, neutering, and appropriate medications. This article will discuss each of these practices and explain how they contribute to the overall well-being of your beloved cat. 1. Regular Veterinary Checkups Just like humans, cats require consistent medical checkups to monitor their health and catch any potential issues early on. Veterinary checkups for your cat generally include: a. Physical examination: Your veterinarian will examine your cat's body, evaluating their weight, coat condition, and physical appearance. This allows them to detect any changes that may indicate underlying health issues. b. Dental examination: Oral health is crucial for cats, as it can impact their overall well-being. Your veterinarian will assess the health of your cat's teeth and gums and recommend any necessary treatments. c. Vaccinations: Routine vaccinations help protect your cat from various infections and diseases. Your veterinarian will ensure your cat is up-to-date with their vaccinations and schedule any boosters as needed. d. Parasite prevention: Cats can be susceptible to various parasites such as fleas, ticks, and worms. Your veterinarian will provide recommendations for preventive treatments to keep your cat parasite-free. e. Diagnostic tests: If your veterinarian suspects any underlying health issues, they may perform diagnostic tests such as blood tests, urinalysis, or imaging studies. Regular veterinary check-ups not only help prevent and early detect potential health issues but also provide the opportunity for you to discuss any concerns with your veterinarian and receive valuable advice about your cat's health and care. 2. Neutering Your Cat Neutering, also known as spaying or castration, is the surgical removal of a cat's reproductive organs. This procedure has numerous health and behavioral benefits for your cat, such as: a. Population control: With millions of cats entering shelters or becoming homeless each year, neutering helps control the overall cat population and reduces the strain on shelters. b. Health benefits: Neutering your cat can significantly reduce their risk of reproductive cancers and infections, especially in female cats. Neutered cats are also less likely to develop certain behavior-related health issues, such as stress and anxiety. c. Behavioral improvements: Unneutered cats often exhibit unwanted behaviors such as roaming, aggression, and marking territory with urine. Neutering can help curb these behaviors, making for a more harmonious relationship between your cat and your household. It is generally recommended to neuter your cat between four to six months of age, but this can be adjusted based on your cat's health and your veterinarian's recommendations. 3. Seek Medications Cats, like any other living beings, can develop health issues that may require medication or supplements. Appropriate medications can help manage existing conditions, prevent the development of new issues, and enhance the overall quality of life for your feline friend. Here are a few common reasons to seek medications: a. Managing chronic conditions: Cats may develop long-term health issues, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or hyperthyroidism, that require ongoing medication to manage and control symptoms. b. Pain relief: If your cat is in pain due to inflammation, sprains, or surgeries, your veterinarian may prescribe the suitable medication to provide pain relief and alleviate discomfort. c. Infections: Cats can be susceptible to infections — bacterial, viral, or fungal — which may require prescribed antibiotics or antifungal medications to treat. d. Preventive care: In some cases, medications can be used as a preventive measure, helping to protect your cat from developing specific health issues. An example is heartworm prevention, which is crucial for keeping your cat safe from this potentially fatal parasite. Always consult your veterinarian before administering any medication to ensure it is appropriate and safe for your cat. Additionally, follow the recommended dosage and schedule, as prescribed by your veterinarian, to guarantee the effectiveness of the medication.

Article: In 1959, when Jean Harper was in the third grade, her teacher gave the class an assignment to write a report on what they wanted to be when they grew up. She poured her heart into her report and expressed her dream of becoming an airline pilot. Her paper came back with an \\"F\\" on it. The teacher told her it was a \\"fairy tale\\". Jean was heartbroken and ashamed. As the years went by, Jean was beaten down by the discouragement and negativity she encountered whenever she talked about her dream. \\"Girls can't become airline pilots; never have, never will. You're crazy. That's impossible. \\"Finally Jean gave up. In her senior year of high school, her English teacher was a Mrs. Dorothy Slaton, a demanding teacher with high standards. One day Mrs. Slaton asked this question: \\"If you had unlimited finances, unlimited access to the finest schools, unlimited talents and abilities, what would you do?\\" Jean felt a rush of the old enthusiasm, and with excitement she wrote down the very old dream. The next thing that Mrs. Slaton said changed the course of Jean's life. The teacher leaned forward over her desk and said, \\"I have a little secret for you. You do have unlimited abilities and talents. When you leave school, if you don't go for your dreams, no one will do it for you. You can have what you want if you want it enough.\\" The hurt and fear of years of discouragement disappeared all of a sudden. Jean felt thrilled and told her about her dream of becoming a pilot. Mrs. Slaton slapped the desk top. \\"Then do it!\\" she said. So Jean did. It didn't happen overnight. In her l0 years of hard work, even facing varieties of laugh, frustration and opposition, she never gave up her dream. Instead, she went on doing everything her third-grade teacher said was fairy-tale. Eventually, Jean Harper became a Boeing 737 captain for the United Airline Company.

A: In some cultures, extreme practices such as mortification of the flesh or painful rites of passage are highly regarded.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Corporal punishment, a form of physical punishment involving the deliberate infliction of pain, is used as a retribution for various offenses or misconduct, usually in settings like schools, homes, and even workplaces. It involves methods such as spanking, paddling, caning, whipping, and slapping, among others. Corporal punishment has been used as a disciplinary measure to address issues like: 1. Disobedience or defiance: If an individual, especially a child or a student, disobeys orders or displays defiance, some authority figures may resort to corporal punishment as a means of asserting control and ensuring compliance. 2. Poor academic performance or laziness: In schools where corporal punishment is allowed, teachers might use it to discipline students for not performing up to the expected standards, not completing assignments on time, or showing a lack of effort in their studies. 3. Bullying or fighting: To curb aggressive behavior among students, some schools use corporal punishment to address incidents of physical altercations between peers or instances of bullying. 4. Theft and dishonesty: In some jurisdictions, stealing and lying are considered grave enough offenses to warrant corporal punishment, especially in case of repeated offenses. 5. Criminal offenses: In some countries, corporal punishment is part of the legal system and is employed as retribution for certain criminal offenses, such as theft, vandalism, or drug-related crimes. It is important to note that the use of corporal punishment as a form of retribution has declined significantly over the years, with numerous countries and states banning it altogether. This decline can be attributed to the growing awareness of the potential psychological and physical harm it may cause, as well as the widespread belief in promoting positive discipline methods and focusing on rehabilitation, rather than retribution. While corporal punishment is still prevalent in certain settings and cultures, there is a general global trend towards eliminating it and adopting alternative, non-violent means of discipline and correction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Scott Langteau has this message for kids:spend less time playing video games. It's a message that many a mom and dad have tried to impress upon many a youngster (and some notsoyoungsters) who spend perhaps a bit too much time with game controllers in hand. But the 40yearold Langteau isn't a parent.He's a veteran   of the video game industry--one who played producer on three \\"Medal of Honor\\" games and cofounded his own game development company. Langteau has just published a children's books called Sofa Boy,which tells the story of a kid who spends too much time sitting on the couch with controller clutched in hand and the rather terrible consequences that follow. It's a fairy tale plucked straight from Langteau's own experiences as a lad with a fondness for video games and his own bouts with a bit of game addiction.But first,Langteau would like to make one thing clear,\\"I'm not saying that you shouldn't play video games.I think video games are great.I think they do great things for kids.\\"Instead,Langteau says his book is all about a little something called moderation  . \\"It's about being well rounded,\\" he says.\\"Just like with anything else,we all need to make sure that there's a variety in what we do.\\" Video gamers can be rather badtempered when it comes to accepting criticism about their favorite entertainment.And understandably so.After all,most people who go around talking about the dangers of playing video games tend to be outsiders--people who don't play video games and certainly don't understand that they can be a valuable and healthy form of entertainment. But Langteau and Sofa Boy seem to be in a  unique position to deliver a message of gaming moderation that the young game masses might actually listen to.After all,this is a man who understands what it means to be a kid with a passion for games.His early experience has taught him a lesson. The answer is:","output":"Question: What is the primary message conveyed by Scott Langteau in his children's book \\"Sofa Boy\\"? A. Video games are unhealthy and should be completely avoided. B. Parents should control the amount of time their children play video games. C. Video games can lead to extremely terrible consequences. D. Video games are great for kids, but should be played in moderation. Justification: I formed the question based on the central theme of the article which revolves around Scott Langteau's views on video games. He has written a children's book conveying a message about video game usage. Hence, the focus of the multiple-choice question is on this message.  All the options are based on different aspects covered in the article; Option A is based on a common misinterpretation of messages like Langteau's, but is said to be false by Langteau himself in the text. Option B refers to a potential conclusion one might draw, but the article does not specify that it's the parent's responsibility. Option C is an echo of the story told in \\"Sofa Boy\\" but is a bit extreme and not directly espoused by Langteau according to the text. Option D correctly summarizes the message delivered by Langteau, thus it is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Thomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825  29 June 1895) was an English biologist (comparative anatomist), known as \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.  - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809  19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.  - Metatheria is one of two mammalian clades , the other being Eutheria , with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic , and which includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals . First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880 , it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials ; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches ( most female marsupials ) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives . Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals : monotremes ( egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna ) , metatheria ( or marsupials , which includes the three American orders ( Didelphimorphia , Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria ) and the four Australasian orders ( Notoryctemorphia , Dasyuromorphia , Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia ) ) , and the eutherians ( or placental mammals ) consisting of twenty one orders , divided into four superorders . Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida . They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula , which includes about five upper and four lower incisors , a canine , three premolars , and four molars . Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition , such as wrist and ankle apomorphies ; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features .  - Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules.  - The neocortex, also called the neopallium and isocortex, is the part of the mammalian brain involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning and language.   - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Theria (Greek: \\"\\", wild beast) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes (the sister taxa to Yinotheria). Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials).    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'taxon rank' with the subject 'metatheria'.

They can be wonderful for seeing a neighborhood or wild space with new eyes, getting inspired to be more creative with angles and subjects, as well as simply spending time with fun people. Here are a few tips for making sure you get the most out of a photo walk. Pick a spot with lots of interest A photo walk is a perfect excuse to go exploring a new area. However, if you've never been to the scene before, you might be disappointed at the final photos. Base your chosen spot on what you feel like photographing---whether that is buildings, people, busy streets, a festival, nature and so on, and make sure the place you're heading for is filled with what you most want to shoot. It will pay off in a satisfying walk if you research your chosen spot beforehand and know what to expect. Invite anyone, no matter what their skill level is You'll be surprised at what you learn from people who seem to know nothing about photography. Even with a simple camera, they can catch some outstanding photos. So bring Aunt Betty or your 10-year-old nephew or anyone else whose company you might enjoy on a walk and keep an open mind. Don't forget them Be sure to take the important small things, such as an extra memory card (or two), an extra fully charged battery, comfortable shoes and clothing. And remember a notepad and pen for taking down notes about places, times, conditions, the names and information of people you meet and any other information you might want to remember about certain shots. Keep an eye out for danger Apart from watching the sky for rain, you'll want to watch out for other people as well. Smartphones are always a target for thieves but they have become much clearer about the value of digital cameras. Don't make yourself a target by standing for a very long time holding your camera out in front of you. If you're in an area that is really busy or you aren't super comfortable, then just be careful about when to use your camera.

They have used other products that work fine: This suggests that they have experience with other products that are effective and may be hesitant to try a new product because they are already satisfied with their current routine. b). They have been lied to before: If they have been lied to in the past about product benefits, this could make them more cautious and skeptical when trying new products. c). They do n't have trust issues: This option contradicts the situation, as they are indeed apprehensive, which indicates some level of distrust or uncertainty. d). They think the price is too low: A low price could raise suspicion about the quality or effectiveness of the product.

To keep your current pets from feeling like your new dog is invading their space, set up separate areas for your pets before you bring in the new pet. Doing this ahead of time can help prevent jealousy and conflict.  [1]. Make sure to choose an area that is readily accessible to both you and your pets when you bring in the new dog. If your dog has adjoining areas that they can retreat to when other pets are around, make sure to assign only your pets to that territory.; [2]. You may also choose to encourage your existing pets to be socialized by playing a game after every hour you spend together with them. This ensures they only get in the habit of barking at your new dog.; [3]. Create a space for the new dog to sleep in that doesn't interfere with the routine of your current pets. This will improve the likelihood of the current pets accepting the newcomer.; [4]. Ask your current pet for directions and give them specific directions like, \\" go down the stairs and turn right. \\" you can also spend time with your current pets by giving them daily positive feedback.; The answer is:","output":"To prevent jealousy in your current pets when getting a new dog, it is important to take a multifaceted approach, focusing on training, space management, and socialization. 1. Work on obedience training with your current pets. This will make it easier for you to control their behavior when introducing the new dog, and it will also reinforce the bond between you and them. 2.

You see, IIM and IIFT are like two different schools that teach special things for grown-ups. IIM stands for Indian Institutes of Management, and IIFT stands for Indian Institute of Foreign Trade. IIM teaches lots of things about running a business and being a good leader. IIFT also teaches about business, but they focus on something called \\"foreign trade.\\" That means they teach about buying and selling things between different countries. So, the IIM and IIFT curriculums are like the lessons they give in these schools, and they're a bit different from each other. Now, about being selected and rejected from those schools, that's okay! You can think of it like trying to join different clubs at school. You see, every club looks for different things in their members, and maybe you were a good fit for IIM C but not for the others. It doesn't mean you're not good enough, it just means that each school has its own way of choosing who can join.

During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received 125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid 360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Shearers pay rose to 250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received 400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over 300,000 per episode. On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made a statement from the producers saying \\"the show must go on,\\" but did not elaborate on what might happen to the characters Shearer voiced. On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors. How many dollars was the difference between Shearer's largest pay increase than his smallest one?","output":"To find the difference between Shearer's largest pay increase and smallest one, we need to identify those increases and their amounts: 1. The pay increase in 1998: From 30,000 to 125,000. 2. The pay increase in 2004: From 125,000 to 250,000. 3. The pay increase in 2008: From 250,000 to 400,000. 4. The pay decrease in 2011 (considering this as a negative increase): From 400,000 to 300,000. Now, let's find the amounts of these pay changes: 1. 1998 pay increase: 125,000 - 30,000 = 95,000. 2. 2004 pay increase: 250,000 - 125,000 = 125,000. 3. 2008 pay increase: 400,000 - 250,000 = 150,000. 4. 2011 pay decrease (as a negative increase): 300,000 - 400,000 = -100,000. The largest pay increase was in 2008 (150,000), and the smallest pay increase (or pay decrease) was in 2011 (-100,000). The difference between Shearer's largest pay increase and his smallest one is: 150,000 - (-100,000) = 150,000 + 100,000 = 250,000."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Available choices: * no. * yes.","output":"The two questions you have asked are related, but they do not have the same meaning. I will address each question separately to provide a detailed and long answer. Why are few people born transgender? Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity (the internal sense of being male, female, or nonbinary) does not correspond with their assigned gender at birth (based on their biological sex). While the exact number of transgender people is difficult to estimate, it is generally considered a small percentage of the overall population. Various studies estimate that transgender people make up somewhere between 0.3% and 1.2% of the population, depending on the country and methodology. There isn't a specific reason why there are relatively fewer transgender individuals than cisgender (those whose gender identity corresponds with their assigned gender at birth) individuals. Research is still ongoing to understand the underlying factors that contribute to someone being transgender. Some studies suggest that genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play roles in the development of gender identity. For example, exposure to certain hormones before birth may influence brain development, resulting in a person's gender identity not aligning with their biological sex. Additionally, certain studies have found that there might be some genetic factors that contribute to being transgender, although these findings are still not definitive and require more research. How are transgender people born? While the precise cause of someone being transgender remains uncertain, evidence points to a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that can contribute to this incongruity between a person's assigned gender at birth and their gender identity. One theory involves prenatal exposure to certain hormones, particularly testosterone, during critical periods of brain development. This theory suggests that abnormal hormone exposure may result in transgender individuals developing a brain that is more similar to the opposite sex, leading to a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. Genetics may also play a role in being transgender. Research has identified specific genes that might be associated with transgender individuals, although it is important to remember that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine the relationship between these genes and being transgender. Lastly, environmental factors may also contribute to being transgender. Some studies have found higher prevalence rates of transgender individuals among first-borns and fraternal twins, which might suggest an effect of the prenatal environment. In summary, while the two questions you posed are closely related, they do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the relatively small percentage of transgender people, while the second question focuses on the factors contributing to the development of transgender individuals. The answers provided suggest that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play a role in the development of someone's gender identity, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms fully."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan.

The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.

Write an article based on this summary: – The National Security Council has condemned the “brutal violence” launched by Syria’s government against protesters, NPR reports. The crackdown is “completely deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” said an official statement. In response, “the United States is pursuing a range of possible policy options, including targeted sanctions.” Officials voiced support for the protesters, whose “call for freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders must be heard.” Though the crackdown in Syria continued today, tensions appear to be on the rise in Syria’s army, as soldiers increasingly oppose violence against the protesters. Some soldiers in Daraa refused to fire on demonstrators. It's not the first report of such a refusal, and a number of military officials have apparently been assassinated after reportedly taking the protesters’ side. A division in the army would “cast serious doubt” on the government’s “ability to survive,” writes Nicholas Blanford in the Christian Science Monitor. Article:","output":"Title: Rising Tensions Within Syria's Army Amid Government Crackdown On Protesters The National Security Council has recently condemned the brutal violence perpetuated by the Syrian government against their own citizens during protests, according to NPR reports. Labeling it as \\"completely deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\\" their official statement reflected international outrage over the government's use of force to suppress its people's demands for democratic rights. In response to the ongoing violence, the United States is reportedly exploring various policy options, which may include targeted sanctions against Syria's government. Additionally, American officials have expressed support for the protesters and highlighted that their demands for freedom of expression, association, and the right to assemble peacefully, as well as the freedom to choose their own leaders, should not be ignored. As the crackdown on protesters continues across Syria, there is a growing sense of unrest within the country's armed forces. Soldiers are becoming increasingly opposed to employing violence against demonstrators, with reports emerging of some soldiers in the city of Daraa refusing to open fire on their fellow citizens. This is not the first instance of military dissent, and there have been several cases of military officials being assassinated for reportedly siding with the protesters. According to Nicholas Blanford of the Christian Science Monitor, the deepening division within the Syrian army could \\"cast serious doubt\\" on the government's ability to withstand the ongoing crisis and maintain control over its populace. The consequences of such discord among the armed forces are far-reaching, as it could potentially lead to a state of internal conflict that would only exacerbate the country's current instability. The widening gap between the government and its people, as well as the rising tensions within key institutions such as the army, are indicative of the growing pressure on the Syrian authorities to address the issues raised by the protesters. As the international community continues to condemn the government's violent reaction to peaceful protests and demand accountability for its actions, there is an increasing chance that more severe consequences may be levied against Syria's leadership. It remains to be seen whether targeted sanctions or other policy options will be effective in compelling the Syrian government to halt its crackdown on protesters and respond constructively to their demands. However, the growing signs of dissent within the military could be instrumental in hastening this process, as a divided army is unlikely to be able to support the government indefinitely. In conclusion, the escalating violence in Syria is indicative of a deepening crisis, and the authorities must move to address the concerns of their citizens and respect their right to peacefully demand democratic change. The increasing rift within the armed forces, combined with international condemnation and pressure for action, could well bring the government to a tipping point, ultimately resulting in a more significant shift in policy or power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Saw II Context: The film opens with Michael (Noam Jenkins), a police informant, finding himself ensnared in a deadly trap created by the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell). A videotaped message informs him that a Venus flytrap-like helmet full of spikes has been locked around his neck and will close on his head unless he finds the key in time. Michael realizes, through hints left by Jigsaw, that the key has been implanted behind his right eye. He finds a scalpel nearby, but cannot bring himself to cut out his own eye. When the timer runs out, the device slams shut, killing him instantly.After arguing with his rebellious teenage son Daniel (Erik Knudsen), Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called to the scene of yet another death perpetrated by Jigsaw on account of his name being written on the wall. Noticing that a padlock on the iron maiden-like device around the victim's neck bares a Wilson Steel logo, he gathers a SWAT team and arrives at the company's abandoned factory, which has now become another lair of Jigsaw's. A set of computer monitors shows several people trapped in a mysterious house, with Daniel among them; a timer is also present, with less than two hours left. Considerably weakened by his rapidly-advancing brain cancer, Jigsaw informs detective Mathews that he will see his son in a \\"safe, secure state\\" if he can sit in the room and converse with him long enough.In the house, the kidnapped people are trying to figure out how they got there. One person is passed out on the floor and later turns out to be Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), a familiar face from the first Saw film wherein she was the only character to escape her trap. There are six people in addition to Daniel and Amanda, and none of them knows who the others are. Amanda finds a cassette player and a note falls to the floor. She plays the cassette and they all learn that the door to the house will open in three hours but a toxic nerve gas is leaking into the house which will kill them in two hours unless they can find antidotes. One of these is in a...","output":"In Saw II, Kramer, also known as the Jigsaw Killer, reveals several important pieces of information throughout the movie. The first major revelation comes when he informs Detective Eric Matthews that his son Daniel is among the group of people trapped in the mysterious house, and that if he can sit and converse with Jigsaw long enough, he will see his son in a \\"safe, secure state.\\" In the house, the kidnapped people, including Daniel and Amanda, learn from Jigsaw's cassette player that they are being subjected to a deadly game. The house is filling with toxic nerve gas and they have only two hours until the gas kills them. They must find the antidotes to the gas, which are hidden in various traps and devices throughout the house. This reveals that Jigsaw's motive is still to force his victims to make difficult choices and endure extreme pain in order to survive and appreciate their lives. As the movie progresses and the victims navigate through the treacherous traps of the house, Jigsaw reveals that all the people in the house, including Daniel, were chosen because they are connected to Detective Matthews and his unlawful practices as a cop. They have been framed or wrongfully convicted by the detective, which ties into Jigsaw's twisted sense of justice. Towards the end of the movie, Kramer reveals that Amanda has been assisting him, having been \\"converted\\" to his cause after surviving her trap in the first Saw film. She has been playing an active role in the development and execution of Jigsaw's deadly games. This is a major twist in the story, as the audience had initially believed Amanda to be another victim in the house. In the final scene, Jigsaw reveals that Daniel is safe and alive in the very same room where Detective Matthews confronted him. This fulfills Jigsaw's earlier promise to the detective, showing that his twisted games and tests are, at least in his own mind, designed with a specific purpose and outcome in mind. Overall, through the character of Kramer or the Jigsaw Killer, Saw II reveals the continued intricate planning of his lethal games, provides detailed insight into his twisted sense of morality and justice, and uncovers the connections between the victims, as well as revealing Amanda as his apprentice.

This process occurs when the high-mass star exhausts its nuclear fuel and can no longer sustain the outward pressure against the immense force of gravity. As a result, the star collapses inward, leading to the formation of a black hole. Black holes are objects with a concentrated mass that possess an extremely strong gravitational pull. They are formed due to the gravitational collapse of a high-mass star, which leads to the formation of a singularity at the core surrounded by an event horizon. Within the event horizon, the gravitational pull is so strong that even light cannot escape, resulting in a region of space that is essentially invisible or \\"black.\\" Given that black holes are considered to be spheres, it is accurate to say that a high-mass star collapsing forms a sphere. The spherical shape is attributed to the strong gravitational forces acting uniformly in all directions, causing the black hole to adopt the most efficient form – a sphere. This sphere encapsulates the event horizon, the boundary within which the gravitational pull of the black hole is so strong that nothing can escape, including light. Outside of the event horizon, the black hole's mass is distributed evenly across the sphere, which results in a symmetrical gravitational field.

They are a popular form of entertainment and communication on social media platforms. Step 2: Identifying the potential ways to make money with memes To make money with memes, one needs to consider various methods, such as:    - Monetizing through advertisements on a website or social media account (e.g., Instagram) focused on memes.    - Selling meme-themed merchandise such as t-shirts, mugs, or stickers.    - Licensing image or meme content to third-party companies for marketing campaigns.     - Creating custom-designed memes or images for clients for any promotional purposes. Step 3: Analyzing how to monetize an original image or meme If you have created an original image or meme, there are various ways to make money from it, such as:    - Licensing your image or meme to be used in marketing or promotional campaigns by other brands.    - Selling prints or merchandise featuring your image or meme.    - Monetizing a social media account or website where you feature your original memes, using advertisement revenue. Step 4: Comparing the possible answers By analyzing the potential ways to make money with memes and monetizing an original meme or image, we can see the processes and methods involved are shared between these two questions.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

But for Mark Budesa, a photographer and bartender in Las Vegas, it's more than that because it actually happened. A week ago, I published a piece on why winning the Powerball might be a bad thing. Budesa got in touch to tell me his incredible story, and he's given me permission to share it here. Like many Americans, Mark Budesa and his wife Shannon have been buying tickets for the recent record-breaking Powerball lottery prizes. Because they live in Nevada which, ironically, is one of only seven states without its own lottery, they drive to Rosie's Den, a shop in Arizona to get these tickets, about an hour each way, with their four-year-old daughter and two-month-old son along for the ride. On January 10, the day after a Powerball drawing in which, yet again, no one had won the grand prize, they headed back to Rosie's Den for more tickets. Since Mark knows himself to have a gambling problem, Shannon always buys the tickets. Usually she brings their daughter along, and in the interests of time, she buys Quick Picks, in which you play numbers randomly selected by a computer rather than choosing numbers yourself and filling out a lottery ticket form. More From Inc.com: 5 Weirdest Millennial-Run Companies You'll Have to See to Believe On this day, there was a longer line than usual so the daughter stayed in the car. Waiting in line alone, Shannon grew bored and idly started filling out a lottery ticket. Though not a gambler, like most Las Vegans, she sometimes finds herself playing slot machines while socializing with her co-workers, and she always plays the same sequence of numbers: 4 (her and her daughter's birth month), 8 (Mark's birthday), 27 (her mother's birthday), and 34 (her mother's birth year). And so she filled in those numbers. \\"Now this is where it gets weird, because she was going to use her birthday, 15, for the last number,\\" Mark says. But she found herself thinking about how much she missed her sister, who died in 1984. Shannon felt bad that she hadn't had a chance to visit her sister's grave on a recent trip home. \\"With that thought, she filled in the last number of the game--19, the day her sister passed away.\\" She filled in all five games on her ticket in this manner. For the extra Powerball game on each ticket she used her daughter's birthday, 10, on four out of the five games, and her own birthday, 15, for the last one. Meanwhile, things weren't going so well on the lottery ticket line. A woman ahead of Shannon was on the phone with her mother, arguing about what numbers they could play, struggling to correctly fill out her card, and straining the patience of everyone around her. Shannon began to worry that she, too, would hold up the line since she wasn't used to filling out tickets. And with that thought, she tore up the ticket, tossed it on a stack of discards on a nearby table, and decided to play a Quick Pick as usual. After the drawing, Mark checked their ticket and discovered they'd won all of 2. Then they went to bed. \\"It wasn't until 5:30 the next morning that my wife turned on the news to see all six of her numbers splashed across the screen,\\" he says. \\"She couldn't believe it. She waited till I woke up to tell me and I didn't want to believe it.\\" For a whole day, Mark did everything he could think of to poke holes in his wife's account. \\"She had no proof. She threw away the evidence,\\" he says. Why didn't she use her own birthday, which was the same as their daughter's birth year? he asked. Why didn't she pick their son's birthday? Or his birth month, which was the same as Mark's? How could she remember numbers she'd picked three days earlier? She was unshakeable. \\"She didn't have to work too hard to remember,\\" he says. \\"Those numbers were us.\\" Finally, he found a ticket form online, printed it out, and asked her to fill it in the same way she had at Rosie's Den. \\"I hope and prayed that she filled it out wrong,\\" he says. \\"She didn't.\\" The Budesas had no choice but to recognize the truth. \\"For 10 minutes, while she stood in line, my son slept, and my daughter and I played music in the car, she had in her hand a ticket for the biggest Powerball drawing in history,\\" Mark says. The winning numbers drawn were 4, 8, 19, 27, 34, and 10 as the Powerball number. Mark calculated that the ripped-up ticket would have won four grand prizes plus a million-dollar prize for the fifth game--a total of 915 million and world record. \\"I don't know how you would have reacted, but for some reason I got scared,\\" he says. \\"I got scared of myself. I didn't know if this was something I could learn to live with. Would it break me? Would it break us?\\" The knowledge \\"consumed me slowly,\\" he says. \\"The pain crept up from my gut into my chest and stayed there. My chest felt like it was ripping apart. Then it finally took over my mind.\\" What if the lady on the phone hadn't been in the line, he wondered? What if her transaction had gone smoothly? What if he had driven more slowly? \\"All she had to do was hand in the ticket,\\" he says. \\"My mind wouldn't stop recycling those thoughts. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.\\" For 10 days, there was a dark cloud hanging over their house. \\"I was worthless during that time, and that made it hard for my wife,\\" he says. \\"She refused to discuss it anymore. She was tired of me. I was tired of me.\\" They turned on the TV--and there was \\"Mr Deeds,\\" a movie about a regular guy who inherits 40 billion. \\"We laughed at the irony,\\" Mark says. The dark cloud began to lift, and the two of them began talking about what they would have done with the money, and how it might actually have changed their lives. And, beginning from that conversation, came healing, and a deeper understanding of what they truly wanted. 5 amazing lessons from the man whose wife tore up a 915 million Powerball ticket Rebecca Hargrove, second from right, president and CEO of the Tennessee Lottery, presents a ceremonial check to John Robinson, right; his wife, Lisa, second from left; and their daughter, Tiffany, left; after the Robinson's winning Powerball ticket was authenticated at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters Friday, Jan. 15, 2016, in Nashville, Tenn.

(AP Photo/Karen Pulfer Focht) Here's some of what they learned from the experience: In the depths of Mark's despair, Shannon apologized profusely for ever telling him about the winning ticket that she threw away. \\"She blamed herself for how I wasn't able to handle it,\\" he says. \\"I told her, even in the midst of it, that it wasn't her. She didn't cause me this pain. I brought it upon myself.\\" More From Inc.com: Here Comes 4-D Printing--and It's Pretty Mind-Blowing She herself handled it fairly calmly by thinking about the butterfly effect, a term coined from a short story in which a time traveler accidentally kills a butterfly and completely changes the course of history. The idea is that even seemingly insignificant actions have profound and unpredictable consequences. If she had played the ticket, she concluded, things would have been altered and different numbers would have been drawn. Mark began thinking about the incidents of bankruptcy, divorce, drug overdose, and even murder that have plagued lottery winners. \\"Just last week, a lottery winner was murdered in a home invasion in Georgia,\\" he says. And that unfortunate winner, 20-year-old Craigory Burch, Jr., had only won about 434,000--an insignificant sum compared to what the Budesas would have had. \\"It would have been pandemonium,\\" Mark says. \\"A world record win? The media would find us. There would be no hiding. No lawyers could protect us.\\" As Mark and Shannon talked through the what-ifs, the conversation turned darker, he says. \\"We would have to move, no doubt about it. We would have to hide. We have young children, we have extended family. Everyone had a hand in it; people might feel they were owed. There would be no escaping the attention. It would have been frightening and dangerous, for us and for our families as well.\\" After they'd talked for a while, Mark stepped outside for some fresh air. \\"I looked up into the sky, breathed in and let my thoughts drift.\\" In his imagination, he held that winning ticket in his hand. And his first instinct was to throw it away. Mark started thinking back to their struggle to have a child. After a year of trying, they visited a fertility clinic. They were both 38 and were told that their odds of having a baby were at least 100 to 1. \\"We beat those odds with our daughter,\\" he says. \\"Four years and eight miscarriages later, we beat them again with a healthy baby boy, delivered when we were both 43. What are the odds of that? Maybe they're close to 1 in 292 million. Maybe throwing away the ticket balanced us out.\\" Years ago, Mark came up with an idea for a movie. \\"It was about an average guy, living his life, never reaching his dreams, struggling through disappointments, never really satisfied with where his life was taking him.\\" Eventually, the guy in the movie finds himself on a ledge, wishing he could start his life over again. Somehow, the wish is granted, and the man wakes up as his four-year-old self, but still has the memories and experiences of his previous life. Because he knows the future, he knows which companies to invest in, so he becomes hugely wealthy. He avoids the relationships that caused him pain in his previous life, but winds up in other relationships that are even worse. Though financially successful, he's a failure at life--and he finds himself back on that ledge, now wishing he could have his old life back.

We'll never know the path that ticket would have taken us on. Maybe somewhere, sometime, we went down that path and didn't like what we found. Maybe her throwing that ticket away wasn't an accident at all.\\" Think of the odds, he says. What are the chances of someone picking four grand prizes plus a million-dollar prize on a single ticket--and then throwing that ticket away? \\"Sounds like someone who may have felt it would ruin her life,\\" he says. \\"Maybe we were on that ledge in a different future. Maybe our wish was granted. Maybe this is our second chance, so let's try and make it a good one.\\" Mark and Shannon Budesa Image: Budesa Photography Summary:","output":"A man named Mark Budesa and his wife Shannon went to buy a lottery ticket for the Powerball drawing, which had a huge prize of almost a billion dollars.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times From now on, Mr. Whitehead gently signaled, their work would be humble, gradual, more likely to deal in shades of gray. The compromise was hard for some of the new activists to swallow. “I am so not convinced,” said Monay Vick, 36. “I believed in Clyde. If you don’t believe something, how do you convince someone else?” When he threw his weight behind Mr. Vanel, 35, a lawyer who challenged Mr. Comrie, 51, a two-term councilman, Mr. Whitehead had gambled that thousands of new voters who had registered for the Obama campaign would tip the balance in a Democratic primary usually decided by a few thousand party regulars. Going door to door, his volunteers drew warm responses from people who said that incumbents too often catered to the neighborhood’s political insiders. But as the polls closed on Sept. 15, red-eyed Vanel volunteers absorbed the preliminary results: Mr. Vanel, 38 percent; Mr. Comrie, 62 percent, amid a record low turnout citywide. “So much for the Obama effect,” said Rance Huff, Mr. Comrie’s chief of staff. Mr. Comrie had just declared victory at the Guy R. Brewer United Democratic Club, the headquarters of the Queens party establishment, where paid campaigners, impatient for their cash, raised such a ruckus that someone called the police. Later, though, Mr. Comrie’s staff members acknowledged that the challengers had forced them to campaign harder than ever before — and that in the process, they had gotten such an earful that the councilman planned to overhaul the way he communicated with the public. “I was not happy with the level of reaction I got from people who felt they didn’t have a connection to the office,” Mr. Comrie said. Some, he said, had asked for help and had been disappointed, but many more simply knew little about their councilman. The campaign seemed to remind some people about him. His staff believes it roughly doubled attendance at his office’s foreclosure-counseling seminars. Even Mr. Vanel got a few calls from people reporting, say, illegal car-repair shops. They thought he was the councilman. The race even roused Archie Spigner, 81, the area’s political éminence grise who was elected its councilman in 1974 and served until 2002, when Mr. Comrie, his protégé, succeeded him. Mr. Spigner now concedes that the Brewer club needs to bring in a new generation, though he is not sure how to find young people who care about politics. “Have a Friday night disco?” he mused. “I haven’t found them — maybe Mr. Whitehead has.” As tickled as he was to have shaken things up, Mr. Whitehead, a retired subway station manager, had hoped for something more dramatic. The Obama campaign electrified southeast Queens, the heart of middle-class black New York, even though elected officials there followed party orders and backed Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary. Mr. Whitehead, who had helped build grass-roots support for Mr. Obama, thought that voters’ next step might be to throw some of those officials out. But it seems the new Obama voters did not show up this time, said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York. The number of new voters who cast ballots in September is not yet public, but there is a clear indicator: While 339,000 first-time voters cast ballots in November 2008, last month about 370,000 New Yorkers voted — total. Mr. Mollenkopf said an Obama effect might yet materialize. Nearly half a million New York voters who registered in 2008 “are still out there” to be tapped, he said, and despite low turnout — which he blamed on the lackluster mayor’s race — council members faced more primary challengers than usual, and four lost, the most in decades. “That augurs well for democracy,” Mr. Mollenkopf said. Mr. Whitehead waited in his garage for a core group of 18 hard-working volunteers. He knew that on primary night, they had felt like rock stars. Mr. Vanel, dodging traffic, had turned a bus stop into a stage, shouting his pitch to weary commuters. Outside a school, a dozen campaigners — including first-time volunteers on both sides — had shouted at one another in a campaign crescendo unlike any the area had witnessed in decades. Mr. Comrie showed up and danced. Passers-by debated the merits of youth versus experience. Now, a week later, Mr. Whitehead already felt better. His cellphone rang nonstop. People inspired by Mr. Vanel — and by other upstarts like Lynn Nunes, who lost a race for City Council by four votes in a neighboring Queens district — wanted to start insurgent campaigns for low-level, usually uncontested offices like district leader. Comrie supporters whispered that Mr. Whitehead wanted his own machine, which he did not deny. Pinned on the garage wall, over a marked-up Council district map, hung a pristine one that Mr. Vanel had fetched from the Board of Elections. The clean map showed Mr. Vanel’s State Assembly district: smaller, perhaps easier to win, up for grabs next year. (Mr. Vanel would not say whether he planned to run.) Mr. Whitehead had made peace with the fact that some challengers in other districts had done better: They started campaigning earlier against less-popular incumbents. Mr. Vanel knocked on doors for five months and got 3,300 votes, more than some winning incumbents. “Comrie had decades, and he got 5,800,” Mr. Whitehead told a volunteer. “Give us one year, and we could beat Leroy.” The volunteers pulled up folding chairs next to boxes of leftover Vanel T-shirts and described how the campaign had changed their lives. Dymitra Etienne, 37, a nurse who met Mr. Vanel when he campaigned at a supermarket, was applying for a master’s program in health policy; Ruthie Campbell, 23, said she once planned to get rich, move away and send back money, but now believed in helping her neighborhood through politics. “I’ve never been so passionate about anything outside of fashion,” declared Ms. Vick, a school transportation supervisor. So Mr. Whitehead and Mr. Vanel asked them to commit to starting something like the Frederick Douglass Institute, the grass-roots research center that Mr. Whitehead had planned before he met Mr. Vanel. They would stick to their core question: Why does the area — with income so high that Queens is the only borough where blacks earn more than whites — suffer from problems like gang violence, underperforming schools and dilapidated storefronts? But instead of research, they would focus on community organizing. Their first mission: Plan a town meeting on youth problems like violence and disaffection, and get 100 people to attend. Yvonne Belizario, 27, who had spent months supporting a doomed challenge against United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, was skeptical. The town meeting could turn out like so many others: all griping, no follow-through. “I’m just eager to get to work,” she said. On Oct. 2, a tragedy in the district infused the meeting plans with new urgency. Kevin Miller, 13, was walking to a McDonald’s when he was fatally shot — an innocent bystander, the police said, in a gunfight between teenage gangsters from the school where the campaign had its finale. Three days later, Mr. Vanel joined a crowd of stone-faced politicians trying to squeeze into the television shot behind Kevin’s mother during a news conference while the boy’s father and brother stood awkwardly to the side. Mr. Vanel and Mr. Comrie both called for more community centers. The local N.A.A.C.P. declared that a blue-ribbon panel would spend seven months studying youth violence. Mr. Comrie said he would start an antigang forum and push for better policing around schools, issues he has raised repeatedly. But many grumbled that it all had a familiar ring. “Every time a child gets shot, we come together; we talk,” Adjoa Gzifa, president of the area’s Community Board 12, said at an N.A.A.C.P. meeting. “But we don’t get to any action.” After much debate, the Vanel team members took to the streets for Mr. Thompson. It was their latest long-shot effort, and they combined it with their own agenda, handing out 1,000 fliers for their youth meeting, now suddenly timely. At the meeting, on Oct. 17 at a church in Hollis, Queens, Michael Walker, 47, whose daughter attends Kevin’s school, expressed frustration that officials like Mr. Comrie could not improve schools more. But he admitted that he had not even known of Mr. Vanel’s campaign. “That’s part of the problem,” he said. “We vote people into office, and we sit back and wait.” Mr. Vanel asked what each person could contribute. Jo-Ann Floyd-Whitehead, Mr. Whitehead’s wife and political partner, wrote it all down. Suddenly, there was a plan: Within weeks, they would open an improvised youth center. The church offered classrooms; the PTA, students. Hugh Byfield, 81, a neighbor and retired garment worker who first drew Mr. Whitehead into the Obama campaign, could teach fashion design. Mr. Walker — whose job had been outsourced to India — could teach computer skills. Others offered math, history, cooking, cheerleading. The Vanel volunteers steeled themselves for disappointment. Even after a tragic killing only about 25 new people had shown up. And some of them might not deliver. But Mr. Whitehead said the project was just a prelude, a way to inspire people to demand more of politicians, campaign against them, even run themselves. “They will become the politicians,” he said. “That’s what I’m interested in.” A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2009, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: In Queens, Still Cultivating the Grass Roots.

He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter.

Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography.

We have the equation: -2060 * z = 3886 * z + 469734  First, let's get all the \\"z\\" parts on one side. We can do that by adding 2060 * z to both sides.  Now we have: 0 = 5946 * z + 469734 Now, it's time to get \\"z\\" all by itself. We need to subtract 469734 from both sides of the equation: -469734 = 5946 * z Now, to find \\"z\\", we can divide both sides by 5946: -469734 / 5945 = z When we divide -469734 by 5945, we get: z = -79 So, little buddy, the answer is z = -79.

This all started when a huge and powerful storm called Superstorm Sandy came through and caused lots of trouble - kind of like when a bully knocks over your block tower. This storm destroyed homes, and even hurt people badly, just like if a big, mean bully knocked over lots of block towers and broke kids' toys. It's really sad when that happens. So, all the lawmakers wanted to give the places that Superstorm Sandy hurt a lot of money to help fix things, kind of like parents giving you a new toy when yours gets broken. They call this money 'relief money' because it helps to make things better - like a bandage for a boo-boo. This vote - or decision - about giving the money was delayed, which means it didn't happen when it was supposed to. The lawmakers were very upset about this delay, kind of like how you might feel if you have to wait a long time for your ice cream. But finally, the House of Representatives, a big group of lawmakers, said 'Yes!' to the relief money. They approved it by 241 to 180 votes, just like when you decide which flavour ice cream you want.  This relief money (or big bucket of band-aids) is supposed to go to many things. Most of it, 16 billion, is to fix transport in New York and New Jersey - like fixing broken trains or buses, so people can go where they need to be, like school or work. And 5.4 billion is going to the Federal Emergency and Management Agency, a big group of people who help when something bad happens - kind of like a superhero team.

In keeping with its eco-development, the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three lights.    Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said, \\"The demand for water is off the chart. So people are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable.\\" The machine, which is about 3 feet wide, is likely to cost PS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose No bats live here happens, how will it affect STRONGER echolocation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's first understand the perturbation hypothesis provided and then analyze its effect on the process of echolocation in bats. Perturbation hypothesis: \\"No bats live here.\\" Here, we are assuming a scenario where there are no bats present in the area. Now, let's break down the echolocation process step by step: Step 1: The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose Since no bats are present in the area, there are no sound waves emitted for echolocation. Step 2: The sound waves hit an object As there are no emitted sound waves, objects won't be hit by any echolocating sound wave. Step 3: Echoes are produced No sound waves hit any objects, so no echoes are produced. Step 4: The echo returns to the bat's ears Since no echoes are produced, no echo will return to the bat's ears. Step 5: The bat hears the echo As no echoes are returning, the bat cannot hear any echo in the environment. Step 6: The bat can figure out where the object is located Since the entire process is disrupted, the bat cannot locate any object through echolocation. Now, let's examine the effect of the perturbation on STRONGER echolocation. The \\"stronger echolocation\\" refers to an improved or more effective form of echolocation. Given the perturbation hypothesis, there are no bats present in the area, which means the environment does not support any echolocation, be it stronger or otherwise. As a result of the perturbation \\"No bats live here,\\" there is a direct effect on the echolocation process. Since no bats are present, the entire echolocation process is disrupted and becomes non-existent in that area. Consequently, this perturbation also affects the possibility of having stronger echolocation in the area, as there is no echolocation happening at all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which island had the average beak size in the finch population increase?  Hint: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Answer:","output":"Island 1 Step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph mentions that Galapagos 1 experienced a drought in recent years. 2. The hint describes the situation during the drought: there were fewer seeds available for finches to eat. 3. Smaller-beaked birds could only eat smaller seeds, while bigger-beaked birds could eat seeds of all sizes. 4. Many small-beaked birds died due to the drought, but birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced. 5.

In the years 1905-1906 close to 7,000 strikes and other work stoppages occurred, involving 1,3 million Poles. Protesters demanded both improved conditions for workers and more political freedom for the Poles. By February, students at Polish universities had joined the demonstrations, protesting russification and demanding the right to study in Polish language. They were joined by high school students and even some from the elementary schools. While the Russian government gave in and agreed to some concessions towards the Polish nationalist movement , many - particularly the workers - were still unsatisfied. In some places in Poland, the school strikes lasted for close to three years. Major demonstrations occurred on May 1 , and about 30 people were shot during a demonstration in Warsaw. Later that month, for a time, public order disintegrated in Warsaw during a spontaneous campaign against the criminal elements as well as Russian collaborators. Question: Which was longer, the general strike or the school strike? Answer:","output":"The school strike was longer. The general strike lasted for four weeks, while the school strikes in some places in Poland lasted for close to three years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   When water freezes in a non-crystalline, amorphous form as frost, the water molecules are fixed in place, but not in a regular, repeating pattern. Frost and other amorphous solids are characterized by their unorganized and unpredictable structure. Because ice comes in both amorphous and crystalline forms, there are differences in the physical properties of ice such as its hardness and density.   Q: What kind of solid is characterized by an unorganized and unpredictable structure?   A: The answer is:","output":"An amorphous solid is characterized by an unorganized and unpredictable structure. In this paragraph, we learn that when water freezes in a non-crystalline, amorphous form as frost, the water molecules are fixed in place but do not have a regular, repeating pattern. This lack of a specific pattern or arrangement results in an amorphous solid, which exhibits unique properties compared to a crystalline solid, which has a well-ordered structure. Amorphous solids, unlike their crystalline counterparts, do not have long-range order or a predictable arrangement of atoms or molecules. Instead, their structure appears disordered on both a local and a larger scale, making it hard to identify any repeating patterns. This randomness occurs because the atoms or molecules in amorphous solids don't have sufficient time to organize themselves properly during the process of formation, such as rapid cooling or a sudden change in conditions. In addition to frost, some other examples of amorphous solids include glass, certain polymers, and gels. As mentioned in the paragraph, the amorphous state of ice results in differences in certain physical properties like hardness and density compared to its crystalline form. Amorphous solids tend to be more pliable and have a less rigid structure than crystalline solids, which exhibit specific, well-defined structures and sharp melting points. In contrast, amorphous solids usually display a more gradual softening or melting behavior as they transition to a more liquid-like state. In summary, an amorphous solid is characterized by its unorganized and unpredictable structure, which distinguishes it from a crystalline solid with a regular, repeating pattern. The disordered arrangement of atoms or molecules in amorphous solids such as frost, glass, and certain polymers leads to unique physical properties that make them different from their crystalline counterparts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"The Appian Way, also known as Via Appia, was one of the most important and strategic roads in ancient Rome. It was constructed in 312 BC by Appius Claudius Caecus and served as the main route connecting the city of Rome to various destinations throughout the Italian Peninsula and beyond. The Appian Way originally ran southeast from Rome to the ancient city of Capua, and later extended to Brindisi, located on the southeastern coast of Italy. Considering its vast length and purpose, the Appian Way connected Rome to numerous locations. Key cities and towns along the route included Capua, Beneventum (Benevento), Tarentum (Taranto), and Brundisium (Brindisi). Smaller towns and settlements were also connected to the Appian Way, making trade, military movements, and communication more efficient throughout the Roman Empire.

Summarize this article: Ten suspected Russian spies are being moved to New York to face charges ahead of a possible prisoner swap.      The suspects are due to appear together in a federal court on Thursday.      Reports from the US and Moscow suggest Washington may opt to deport the 10 in exchange for Russian prisoners.      Neither Russian nor US authorities have commented on the reports. The lawyer of a man jailed in Russia for spying for the CIA is reported as saying he is to be traded for a person held in the UK.      Anna Stavitskaya, the lawyer for nuclear scientist Igor Sutyagin, told the BBC that Moscow would expel him from Russia in exchange for an unnamed UK detainee.      Sutyagin, a nuclear specialist, is serving a 15-year jail sentence after being convicted of passing information to a UK firm allegedly used as a front by the CIA.      It remains unclear whether the suspects held in New York are to be involved in any swap, but in a move that fuelled speculation, a top US diplomat met the Russian ambassador to Washington.      No details were given of the talks between undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns, a former US ambassador to Moscow, and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak other than the fact that the issue of spies came up in the meeting, in which they also discussed Iran.      'Next step'      In New York on Wednesday, a court unsealed an indictment against the 10 alleged Russian agents and an 11th suspect who went missing after being released on bail in Cyprus.

He said he had spoken to US prosecutors and Russian officials about a speedy resolution to the case.      The 10 accused were arrested last month on suspicion of conspiring to work as illegal agents for the Russian government.      The crime is less serious than espionage but carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.      Nine of the group are also accused of money laundering.      Rapid resolution      Three of the suspected spies had been due to attend a court hearing in Virginia on Wednesday.      But the hearing was postponed and orders were issued to transport them \\"promptly to the Southern District of New York for further proceedings\\".      Two others were to be transported from Boston.      No reason has been given for the transfer to New York, where the other suspects are in custody.      On Wednesday, the New York Times quoted sources close to the case as saying the federal government was seeking a rapid resolution.      Meanwhile, the US government said it would appeal against a New York judge's decision to allow one suspect, Vicky Pelaez, to be released on bail.      The court will hear arguments in the matter on Friday.      'Illegal agents'      In Russia, Sutyagin was quoted as saying that he expected to be put on flights to Vienna, then London, on Thursday.      According to his brother, Dmitry, he said he had been told by Russian officials that he would be released and sent to the UK in exchange for an unknown number of spies.      The officials met Sutyagin on Monday at a prison in Arkhangelsk, northern Russia, and US officials were at the meeting, the brother said.      After Monday's meeting, the prisoner was reportedly moved to Moscow's Lefortovo prison.      Sutyagin's lawyer, Ms Stavitskaya, told Reuters that her client had agreed to be swapped \\"as he had no other choice left\\".      \\"He knew that otherwise his whole life would be broken but he still insists he is innocent,\\" she said.      Russian media quote a member of Sutyagin's family as saying he had seen a list of names of prisoners likely to be swapped by Russia, including Sergei Skripal.      Skripal is a Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer convicted of spying for the UK in 2006.      What is your reaction to this story?

Send us your comments. ||||| In an apparent throwback to the Cold War, Moscow and Washington are discussing a deal to swap 10 of the suspected deep-cover Russian agents arrested last month in the U.S. for prisoners held in Russia, according to people familiar with the talks.      Two U.S. officials said talks about a possible plea agreement were continuing. The discussions weren't advanced enough for a deal to be imminent, but prosecutors agreed to postpone some court hearings for the alleged Russian spies while U.S. and Russian diplomats discussed an agreement.      Such a deal could result in Russia agreeing to release prisoners, one of the officials said. Officials at the Kremlin and Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service declined to comment Wednesday.      The 10 suspects were expected to be arraigned in a federal court in New York Thursday afternoon.      The mother and brother of Russian physicist Igor Sutyagin, who was convicted in 2004 of spying for the U.S., said he had signed a deal to be exchanged under the agreement after prison authorities suddenly brought him to Moscow from the prison in Russia's far north, where he has been serving his 15-year sentence.      Mr. Sutyagin has previously denied he was a spy; his case has been criticized by human-rights advocates and in some Western capitals as an example of Russia's spy agencies railroading innocent specialists through a compliant court system. Russian security officials reject that.      News Hub: Russia Spy-Swap Deal Expected 2:15 Moscow and Washington are discussing a deal to swap the 10 suspected deep-cover Russian agents arrested last month in the U.S. for prisoners held in Russia, people familiar with the talks say. John Bussey and Michael Rothfeld discuss.      A swap deal would be the first since the end of the Cold War two decades ago. Before that, Moscow and Washington periodically exchanged captured spies, such as in 1962, when captured U.S. Air Force Pilot F. Gary Powers was swapped for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Later, the Soviet government began exchanging dissidents for its agents captured in the West.      \\"We're rolling back the clock,\\" said Yuri Ryzhov, a former Russian ambassador and prominent academic who heads a commission that has defended scholars accused of treason. \\"It's the 1970s now.\\"      Russia's 11? View Interactive Read more about the spy suspects and allegations against them in the complaints.      An exchange deal would help both Moscow and Washington put the uncomfortable spy affair behind them. Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have invested heavily in the \\"reset\\" in U.S.-Russia relations, seeking to improve ties. The spy arrests, which came just over a day after Mr. Medvedev had left the U.S. after a warm official visit to Washington and California, had threatened to cast a pall over the recovering relationship.      U.S. prosecutors in New York on Wednesday unsealed formal charges against all 11 suspects, including one alleged agent who jumped bail in Cyprus last week and remained at large. They were charged not with espionage but with the lesser crime of being a foreign agent without registering, as required. Nine of the suspects were also charged with money laundering, according to the indictment.      The indictment contains a brief listing of the allegations the government made previously in its criminal complaint, including alleged money drops, radio transmissions to Moscow spy handlers and a meeting with a U.S. government nuclear researcher who was a spying target.      A federal judge on Wednesday granted prosecutors' request to delay the release on bail of Vicky Pelaez, a Spanish-language journalist arrested in Yonkers, N.Y., and believed by prosecutors to be the lone non-Russian national in the alleged spy ring.      Ms. Pelaez's attorney, John M. Rodriguez, said the Russian government called his office Tuesday and asked whether he thought his client would be open to the possible swap. He said he told the Russian government that he didn't believe his client would be open to that. A U.S. official familiar with the matter said Ms. Pelaez would likely have to face trial if she didn't agree to be part of the proposed swap.      View Full Image Reuters Svetlana Sutyagin, center, mother of Igor Sutyagin, who may be released from prison in Russia as part of a swap with the U.S., with Dmitry Sutyagin, Igor's brother, and lawyer Anna Stavitskaya in Moscow Wednesday.      Robert Baum, a lawyer for another of the suspects, Anna Chapman, who was arrested in New York, said he had also been contacted by the Russian government. He said Russian officials had visited Ms. Chapman in jail on Saturday without him present or contacting him. Foreign citizens are legally allowed a visit from consular officials when under arrest. Mr. Baum said Ms. Chapman had initially wanted to fight the charges but was currently facing \\"odious\\" detention.      Mr. Baum said he was in discussions with the Russian and U.S. governments about a possible resolution in this case, and that the talks were \\"very sensitive.\\"      \\"I feel that our discussions will probably be resolved by tomorrow, one way or another,\\" Mr. Baum said Wednesday.      A quick end to the spy affair would help the U.S. avoid what some observers said could be a potentially difficult trial. An exchange would also prevent U.S. law enforcement from having to disclose counterespionage tactics during the discovery process leading up to a trial.      Prosecutors alleged the suspects had spent years disguising themselves as Americans with ordinary suburban lives and families to gain entree to the political and business elite. Although they are charged with using fake passports and secret radio communications, the information they are accused of having collected seemed largely available publicly.      Some of the suspects bore children while in the U.S. And some of the accused have begun arranging to have family take the children to Russia, according to court documents. The U.S. is unlikely to oppose this.      The attorney for alleged Russian spy confirms prisoner swap talks between Washington and the Kremlin. Video Courtesy Fox News.      Mr. Sutyagin, the Russian physicist, maintains that the information he was convicted of providing to a British company that was allegedly a front for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was garnered from open sources.The account Mr. Sutyagin, the Russian physicist, gave his relatives was straight out of a spy novel.      On Monday, he was working construction as usual at the Kholmogory harsh-regime prison camp when a prison officer came up and told him to pack his things, his mother, Svetlana, told reporters Wednesday. He wasn't told where he was going, but was driven to the airport and flown to Moscow, where he was taken to the Lefortovo prison, a special facility run by one of the KGB's successor agencies, the Federal Security Service.      There, the terms of the deal were explained to him by what Mr. Sutyagin said appeared to be a senior official of the Foreign Intelligence Service, who was accompanied by three U.S. officials, he told his mother and brother.      The U.S. had chosen the Russians to be released, Mr. Sutyagin was told, according to his relatives, who said the swap would involve equal numbers on each side.      \\"He couldn't not sign the document,\\" his mother said.      She said he remembered only one other name of those to be exchanged: Sergei Skrypal, a Russian army colonel convicted of spying for the U.K. in 2006.      Elena Lebedeva-Romanova, a lawyer for Mr. Skrypal, said she couldn't confirm or deny whether he was part of any deal because she hadn't been in contact with him. \\"I'm extremely surprised,\\" she said. \\"This whole story sounds like a movie.\\"      Mr. Sutyagin's mother said officials told him that he would be flown to Vienna to be exchanged on Thursday and go from there to the U.K.      They said he would retain his Russian citizenship—a break from Cold War practice when dissidents were exiled—though his lawyer said she was skeptical he would ever be allowed to return to Russia. He was given a white shirt and tie to wear for his passport photo, but not allowed to shave, his lawyer said.      Once he had signed the deal, prison officials contacted his relatives for the hastily organized visit that took place early Wednesday.      —Anna Masterova and      Olga Padorina in Moscow,      and David Benoit      and Chad Bray in New York      contributed to this article.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which magazine was around for a longer time period, the Missbehave or the Woman's Journal? Answer:","output":"The Woman's Journal was around for a longer time period than the Missbehave magazine. To provide a detailed explanation, let's dive into the history and timelines of both magazines: 1. Woman's Journal:  The Woman's Journal was a weekly American women's rights periodical established by Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry Browne Blackwell, in 1870. It was published in Boston, Massachusetts, and its primary focus was on women's suffrage and related issues. Over the years, the Woman's Journal played a pivotal role in the women's rights movement and served as a platform for women activists, writers, and speakers to present their ideas and work. The Woman's Journal went through a series of mergers and name changes through its history. In 1917, it merged with a magazine called The Woman's Journal and Suffrage News to become The Woman Citizen. Later, in 1927, it was merged with The Woman's National Weekly (founded in 1920) and continued to be published under the name Woman's Journal and Nation's Women. After further mergers and consolidations, the magazine ceased publication in 1931. This means the Woman's Journal lasted for approximately 61 years (1870-1931) through diverse changes. 2. Missbehave Magazine: Missbehave was a relatively short-lived, quarterly American women's magazine established in 2006. It was founded by Mary H.K. Choi, who previously worked at Complex magazine. Missbehave was targeted at young women with an edgy, urban, and modern outlook. The magazine's content focused on fashion, music, beauty, entertainment, and lifestyle topics with unconventional narratives and aesthetics. However, Missbehave magazine faced financial challenges and was unable to sustain itself in the competitive market of women's publications. As a result, Missbehave ceased its print publication in 2009, and the online version was discontinued shortly after. In conclusion, the Woman's Journal, with its rich 61-year history, was around for a significantly longer time period compared to the Missbehave magazine, which only lasted for approximately three years (2006-2009). While both magazines catered to women's interests, the Woman's Journal had a substantial historical and social impact, mainly due to its central role in the women's suffrage movement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\" Local  A variety of local and Spanish foodstuffs can be transported home with a minimum of fuss and bother, including almonds, olives, olive oil, sausage, cheese, and dried figs.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"You will not have that much issue with customs if you bring home Spanish foodstuff from your trip. \\"?","output":"If the given premise is true, it suggests that a variety of local and Spanish foodstuffs can be easily transported back home with minimal inconvenience, including almonds, olives, olive oil, sausage, cheese, and dried figs. In this scenario, the hypothesis \\"You will not have that much issue with customs if you bring home Spanish foodstuff from your trip.\\" is likely to be supported by the premise, meaning that the hypothesis can be considered reasonably valid given the information presented in the premise. In order to clarify whether this hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's analyze the related factors that may have an impact on the ease of transporting such foodstuffs through customs and back to one's home country. 1. Origin of the foodstuffs: The premise specifies that the food items in question are local and Spanish in origin. The safety and quality of Spanish food products are generally well-regarded, which might positively influence the customs process. 2. Packing and presentation: The premise mentions that these food items can be transported \\"with a minimum of fuss and bother,\\" which implies that they are typically packaged and presented in a non-problematic manner for customs officials to inspect and approve. This would further support the hypothesis, suggesting that the food products' packaging facilitates a smoother customs experience. 3. Perishability and shelf life: The food items listed (almonds, olives, olive oil, sausage, cheese, and dried figs) generally have longer shelf lives and can withstand transportation without heavy refrigeration or special handling. As such, customs officials might be less concerned about these items posing health risks or spoiling during transit. 4. Legal restrictions and regulations: Different countries have varying regulations and restrictions on importing food items. However, the mentioned food items are typically considered non-hazardous by most customs agencies and are less likely to be subject to strict importation limitations. This also strengthens the support for the hypothesis that transporting Spanish foodstuffs should not present significant customs challenges. While we can't definitively conclude that there will be no customs issues for every scenario, the given premise's information strongly indicates that travelers should not expect significant difficulties when bringing home Spanish foodstuffs from their trip. As the premise accounts for several factors that contribute to a smoother customs experience - such as the origin, packaging, perishability, and legality of the food items - the hypothesis seems to be reasonably entailed and supported by the given information."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The soldiers name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth Pena) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.Edy then travels to his store, a small neighbourhood supermarket. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friends Johnny (Luis Gusman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce.

Let's break down each sentence to better understand the similarities and differences between them. Sentence 1: The 1966 National Football League season was the 17th season of the team with the Cleveland Browns. In this first sentence, the focus is on the 1966 National Football League (NFL) season. It emphasizes that this was the 17th season in which the Cleveland Browns participated as part of the NFL. The phrase \\"the team\\" implies the Cleveland Browns, but it does not directly mention their name. Sentence 2: The 1966 Cleveland Browns season was the team 's 17th season with the National Football League. In the second sentence, the focus is more specifically on the 1966 season of the Cleveland Browns. It establishes that this particular season represented the team's 17th with the National Football League (NFL). In this sentence, the words \\"the team\\" are used in possession of the 17th season, denoting their belonging with the NFL. Although they have structural and focus differences, both sentences ultimately convey that the 1966 season was the Cleveland Browns' 17th season as part of the NFL.

The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol.

B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","output":"B. It is not possible to tell. Explanation: In the given premise, we have a woman in shorts walking next to a car in a tropical area. The hypothesis, however, presents a woman in a dress walking next to a car without mentioning the environment. In order to determine if the hypothesis is true or false, we need more information. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different scenarios with distinct clothing choices for the woman. While it is not impossible for both scenarios to be true, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise being true. In a tropical area, it is reasonable to assume that both shorts and dresses could be common attire due to the warm climate. It is plausible that in such an area, a woman might choose to wear either shorts or a dress, depending on her personal preference, the occasion, or other factors. Nevertheless, the premise alone does not provide sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the hypothesis. Furthermore, it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis are not mutually exclusive. That is to say, even if the premise is true, the hypothesis might still be true or false independently. The woman in shorts walking next to the car in a tropical area could change her attire to a dress and walk by a car, thereby fulfilling the hypothesis. Conversely, if the premise is false (e.g., the woman is not in a tropical area, or she is not walking next to a car), the hypothesis may still be true in a different context.

Carson chipped Quinn's tooth with a hammer by mistake and immediately started apologizing.  Given the question \\"What will Carson want to do next?\\", is \\"have Quinn chip his tooth\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"have Quinn chip his tooth\\" is not a valid answer for what Carson would want to do next, primarily because it does not address the core issue at hand, which is the accidental injury caused to Quinn's tooth. Instead, Carson would likely want to seek a solution that would fix or, at the very least, alleviate the problem he inadvertently created. A more reasonable course of action that Carson might want to undertake could involve the following steps: 1. Ensure that Quinn is alright: First and foremost, Carson should assess the extent of the injury and make sure that Quinn is not in severe pain or discomfort. Depending on the severity, offering immediate first aid or pain relief may be necessary. 2. Apologize and take responsibility: Carson should apologize sincerely and accept any consequences stemming from his actions. Demonstrating genuine concern and empathy can help diffuse the situation and ease tensions between the two parties. 3. Arrange for dental care: If Quinn's tooth is significantly damaged, it may be necessary to enlist the help of a dental professional. Carson should take the initiative to find a qualified dentist and ensure that Quinn is provided with care as soon as possible. If there are any costs associated with the dental treatment, Carson should offer to bear those costs or find a way to contribute towards them. 4. Reflect on the incident and learn from it: After taking care of Quinn's immediate needs, Carson should take some time to reflect on the incident and strive towards being more cautious in the future. Understanding how and why the accident occurred can help prevent similar incidents from happening again. 5. Rebuild the relationship: Depending on the level of trust and camaraderie between Carson and Quinn prior to the accident, Carson may need to make an effort to rebuild their relationship. This could involve acts of kindness, spending time together, or engaging in activities that they both enjoy to restore their bond. In conclusion, while the idea of having Quinn chip Carson's tooth might be seen as a form of retaliation or retribution, it would not be a constructive or logical response to the situation at hand. The primary focus should be on repairing the damage caused, both physically and emotionally, and ensuring that such incidents are not repeated in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"You will now watch an instructional film to see just what kind of stress the people in medieval ages had to deal with.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"People in the medieval ages had little stress.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, which states that there is an instructional film showing the types of stress people in the medieval ages had to deal with, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"People in the medieval ages had little stress\\" is not true. This inference can be further supported by examining various aspects of life in the medieval ages, including social, economic, political, and environmental factors, which contributed to creating a stressful environment for the people living at the time. 1. Social Factors: Medieval society was highly hierarchical, with a rigid class structure. The feudal system ensured that each social stratum had its own set of responsibilities and expectations, and it was extremely difficult to move up in social status. This created stress for individuals as they constantly had to meet the expectations of their superiors while maintaining their social standing within their own class. 2. Economic Factors: People in the medieval ages faced various economic stressors, such as famine, high taxation, and the devaluation of currency—all of which contributed to a constant struggle for survival. The majority of the population lived in poverty, working as peasants and laborers, and the restrictive nature of the feudal system made it challenging for them to improve their financial situation. 3. Political Factors: During the medieval ages, there was a lack of centralized political authority, resulting in constant power struggles between rival factions and kingdoms. This led to numerous conflicts, including wars, invasions, and disputes over land and resources. The general population had to endure the consequences of these conflicts, such as forced conscription, destruction of property, and loss of life, which inevitably caused significant stress and fear. 4. Environmental Factors: The medieval era experienced several environmental challenges, such as the Little Ice Age, which disrupted agricultural production and led to widespread famine. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitation and medical knowledge resulted in the spread of numerous diseases, including the infamous plague, which wiped out a significant proportion of the European population during the 14th century. The uncertainty and terror brought about by these environmental factors significantly contributed to the stress experienced by people in the medieval ages. 5. Psychological Factors: The medieval period was characterized by a strong belief in supernatural forces, including witches, demons, and other entities thought to bring about misfortune and suffering. The constant fear of such forces, alongside superstitions, and the pervasive influence of the church, led to a heightened sense of anxiety and stress for individuals as they tried to navigate their lives while adhering to strict religious doctrines and avoiding the wrath of the supernatural realm. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"People in the medieval ages had little stress\\" is not supported by the evidence available. In fact, people during the medieval era had to contend with a variety of issues and challenges that were unique to their time, which contributed to a significant amount of stress and anxiety. The instructional film mentioned in the premise is likely to delve into these stressors, providing a window into the lives of people in the medieval ages and a better understanding of the challenges they faced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Googling the issue led me here, so I'll share my experience.The product specifically states that it is compatible with rapid start fluorescent lamps; however, when in auto mode, the fluorescent lights will only flicker. The fluorescent lights will stay on when placed in \\"on\\" mode, but that defeats the purpose of the product. The best suited locations for this device are in laundry rooms and/or garages. Generally you're using compact fluorescent or rapid start fluorescent lighting in those areas.The packaging clearly misleads the consumer during purchase; therefore, this product is garbage.***STAY AWAY*** Answer: A:","output":"Based on this review, the user would not recommend this product. The user faced issues with compatibility, as the product was unable to function properly with rapid start fluorescent lamps despite claiming compatibility. The product's purpose was defeated due to this issue, and the user felt misled by the packaging. They advised others to stay away from this product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(1) Under the British Raj , the Bombay presidency was part of the Bijapur district . (2) The Bijapur District was part of the Presidency of Bombay under the British Raj . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing.  The first sentence suggests that the 'Bombay Presidency' was a subset or part of the larger 'Bijapur district' during the time of British Raj. This implies that Bijapur district was a larger administrative unit, and Bombay presidency was a smaller one within it. On the other hand, the second sentence indicates 'Bijapur District' was a part of the larger 'Presidency of Bombay' during the British Raj, suggesting the Presidency of Bombay was a larger unit, and Bijapur district fell within its jurisdiction. Therefore, while the timescale (the British Raj) and the entities involved (Bombay Presidency and Bijapur District) remain the same in both sentences, their implied hierarchical geographical relationship to each other is reversed. Hence, these sentences are not conveying the same meaning. They are providing contrasting descriptions of the administrative alignment of the Bombay Presidency and Bijapur District under the British Raj."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents. His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television.

Die derzeitige Obergrenze für Verwaltungsausgaben gewährleistet bekanntlich keine ausreichenden Ressourcen für die Vorbereitung auf die Erweiterung. Translate this to English?","output":"The current upper limit for administrative expenses, as is well known, does not guarantee sufficient resources for preparing for the expansion. This statement highlights that the present cap set on administrative expenditures is insufficient to account for the resources necessary in anticipation of an expansion. In this context, \\"expansion\\" could refer to a company's growth, the enlargement of an organization, or possibly even relating to the European Union's involvement as a concept since the original statement is in German.  It is essential to allocate adequate resources for administrative tasks during expansion, such as hiring and training new staff, integrating systems, and streamlining communication and operations. Inadequate preparation could lead to inefficiencies, mismanagement, and difficulties in integrating or adjusting to the new organizational scale. To address this issue, decision-makers should consider revising the upper limit for administrative expenses or finding other ways to allocate the necessary resources for the smooth execution of this expansion. Some strategies include: 1. Evaluating the current allocation of resources and identifying areas where adjustments can be made to accommodate the expected increase in administrative needs. This may involve reallocating resources from less critical areas or cutting back on non-essential expenses. 2. Thinking strategically in terms of long-term goals and ensuring that the budget for administrative expenses is aligned with the organization's overall expansion objectives. This means properly forecasting the needs of an expanded organization, and factoring in any improvements or increased capacity required for departments and personnel. 3. Incorporating cost-effective solutions to save on administrative expenses. For example, using technology to automate certain tasks or employing remote work to save on office space. 4. Seeking external funding sources, such as grants, investments, or partnerships that can help cover the costs of expansion. This could reduce the burden placed on existing resources or prevent having to cut back on essential operations. 5. Assessing potential risks and challenges in the expansion process and proactively establishing contingency plans. This may involve setting up an emergency fund, diversifying revenue streams, or having insurance to help safeguard against unexpected setbacks. In conclusion, while the current upper limit for administrative expenses might not sufficiently cover the necessary resources for a smooth expansion, several strategies can be employed to ensure proper resource allocation and adaptability during this crucial period. Decision-makers should engage in a comprehensive analysis and planning process to anticipate needs and allocate resources effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: One of the most important parts of any style is learning how to properly layer and combine pieces of clothing. Most rugged clothing pieces go together without much planning, but there’s still an art to mixing and matching. Start by choosing a pair of pants, then add a shirt that goes well with the color and style of the pants. Then layer on a sweater, vest or blazer. Pay attention to the textures of the clothes: the more textures you add to an outfit (wool, canvas, cotton), the more rugged and versatile your outfit will look. Then add a pair of shoes and socks that complement your outfit. Finally, add your wristwear. Hair is a very important part of rugged style. If your hair is short, sweep it back with bit of pomade. If you have longer hair, use a matte finishing paste to give your hair some choppy waves. Remember, rugged fashion takes cues from classic styles, so don’t go too outlandish or long with your hair. Grow some facial hair. If you’re able to, try growing a bit of scruff. A small beard can help you give off a rugged vibe. Make sure to trim it up a bit though: rugged doesn’t necessarily mean unkempt. Ruggedness isn’t just about clothes. If you really want to pull off a rugged look, you’ll have to delve into stereotypical “masculinity” a bit to round off the look. “Rugged” men aren’t afraid to do some hard work and get their hands dirty, so try to adopt and incorporate this mentality into your daily life. Also, though it’s certainly not required, consider hitting the gym. A little muscle under your shirts will go a long way to add to  your rugged persona.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? If there is one thing in this world I hate, are fricking know-it-alls!! I ordered a fuel pump from Autozone in west covina, not that long ago, IT FAILED ON THE WAY TO PHOENIX AZ this new years \\"weekend\\". Where to start......  I called the store I usually deal with here in Pasadena, He gave me this Autozone's phone number, and told me that they handled commercial accounts, and had the fuel pump in stock. I called, and Tara answered the phone....EXTREMELY NICE GIRL!!! THANK YOU FOR YOU HELP!! (hence the one star).  Granted this autozone is damn near 25 miles away from where we were staying, and my buddy drove me over there. When we got there, Tara was really quick to help us out...but then...out of nowhere, comes this \\"commercial Manager\\" I think his name was Tom....I told him of the problem I was having, and telling him that this was the second time THEIR fuel pump had failed...  what it was doing, was not marking correctly how much gas my truck had....I filled up the tank with 80 dollars, and it told me that I had 6 miles to empty....we would start to drive, and maybe 15 minutes later...it would shoot up to half a tank, then....5 more minutes, it would shoot all the way up to full!  HERE'S WHERE IT GOT DICEY, THE FIRST THING HE DID, WAS SAY TO ME...\\"OH, THE FUEL PUMP IS GOOD, ITS PUMPING FUEL RIGHT? \\"yes\\" THEN THE PROBLEM IS YOUR TRUCK, ITS NOT READING THE SENDING UNIT ON THE FUEL PUMP!! CHECK YOU WIRING, OR TAKE IT TO A CERTIFIED 12 VOLT SPECIALIST!!  HELLO!! WTF DO YOU THINK I AM!!! I DO 12 VOLT FOR A LIVING BUDDY!! DAMN NEAR 15 YEARS!!!   So I started to explain to this know it all, that its not the first time it has happened, it happened once before, and logically, its not possible...my OEM fuel pump failed, because the pump went out.....not the fuel pump sending unit..  Whats happening here, is that Autozone is selling 2nd hand products, I am never buying from them again...and as for Mr. Know it all...my buddy, who was with me, is a 28 year mechanic, I have been a 12 volt installer for 15 years....next time, just shut the hell up and sell me what I need. I understand you want to stand behind your company, but I wasn't there to argue with you, I was there to get my damn truck fixed so I could come back to California....  Just a quick update, both of the fuel pumps, that i bought from autozone, came apart inside my gas tank....the first one, came out in 4 pieces, the second one came out in 2....what kind of crap are the selling over there....if this pump fails, I think a lawsuit is in order, I can't be dropping my gas tank every 6 months because of this crap!!! NO BUENO AUTOZONE....  My commercial account is going to buy anything from you either!!!","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as predominantly negative with a small positive aspect. 1. The review starts with strong negative language (\\"I hate, fricking know-it-alls\\") 2. The mention of the fuel pump purchased from Autozone failing is a negative aspect. 3. The writer praises Tara as extremely helpful and nice, which is a positive aspect. 4. The encounter with the commercial manager, Tom, is portrayed negatively as he dismissed the reviewer's knowledge and experience in the field. 5. The review criticizes Autozone for selling potentially substandard products and includes a negative update on the fuel pumps. 6. Threatening a lawsuit and stating that they will not make any more purchases from Autozone emphasizes the negative sentiment. Overall, the reviewer's experience with Autozone is largely negative, with Tara being the only positive part of their interaction. The sentiment focuses mainly on the poor quality of Autozone's fuel pump and the unhelpful attitude of the commercial manager."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: April 2-May 2 is the worst 30 day period for me. The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. When did his wife died?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft.   - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The PZL.48 Lampart ( Leopard ) was a Polish heavy fighter - bomber design , that remained only a project , owing to the outbreak of World War II.  - A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance. The dedicated light bomber disappeared as fighters, due to advancements in powerplants and aircraft design, were eventually able to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also carrying out other missions and roles.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - A fighter-bomber is a fighter aircraft that has been modified, or used primarily, as a light bomber or attack aircraft. It differs from bomber and attack aircraft primarily in its origins, as a fighter that has been adapted into other roles, whereas bombers and attack aircraft are developed specifically for bombing and attack roles.   - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. What did the author say about the Australian sun? - something about it causing injury - not enough information - something about it being mild to skin - something about it being harsh on the skin Answer:","output":"The author mentioned that the Australian sun is severe and causes a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year.

Go shopping and ask for a bra size fitting at a lingerie store to learn your real size. Not only will they last longer, but better quality bras will fit better and help to enhance your boobs more. These bras will push your breasts up and out, making them appear to be larger. Try on different varieties to test their effect, as well as comfort. Tighter clothes will enhance the shape of your chest, while looser or flowing tops or dresses will make your chest seem shapeless.Be careful not wear clothes that are too tight though! Extra tight shirts may squash your boobs, leaving you worse off. Invest in silicon “chicken cutlets” that can help pad your bust, or if you’re on a budget, use foam or other padding from around the house. Using a large brush, apply the makeup to the inner edges of your breasts, creating a contour and the illusion of shadow. Blend to make it appear more natural. Step back three feet and look in the mirror to make sure that your boobs look real, and not as if you’ve painted them on!

Using a wooden cutting board is less damaging to the knife, and sharpening and honing the knife regularly are essential for keeping the knife in good condition. Option 2 is incorrect because it discusses an unnecessarily large cutting board size and provides incorrect information about marble being prone to rust; knives could rust, but not marble. Option 3 is incorrect because it suggests sharpening knives using a spare set of knives, which is not a proper method for knife sharpening. Knives should be sharpened with a sharpening stone or honing rod. Option 4 is incorrect because it provides irrelevant advice about not applying pressure to the handle and removing fat and weed from the blade, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining the knife's sharpness or preventing damage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Ever since farmers began to grow grain, they have had to protect their crops from birds. In the 1300's, English farmers hired children to protect their crops. They were called \\"bird scares\\". The children chased birds and threw stones at them. Bird scares were replaced in the 1800's by scarecrows. A scarecrow is anything that is set in a field to scare birds away. Often it is a pole dressed like a person. Some farms with small fields still use scarecrows today. Farming became big business in the twentieth century. Scarecrows could no longer protect the huge fields of grain, so farmers used poisonous chemicals on the fields. The poison made the grain bitter. The birds usually would not eat the bitter grain. Although they can prevent crops from being destroyed by insects and birds, some chemicals can be harmful to humans. Therefore, farmers are using fewer chemicals now than they did twenty years ago. Perhaps scarecrows may be seen more often in the fields in the future. The answer is:","output":"A. Scarecrows  The multiple choice question can be:  What was the original method used by English farmers in the 1300's to protect their crops from birds before the introduction of \\"scarecrows\\"? A. Using chemicals  B. Using traps C. Hiring children known as \\"bird scares\\" D. Using natural predators The correct answer to this question (option C) is found in the article which states that English farmers hired children to protect their crops in the 1300s, and they were known as 'bird scares'. The other options were not mentioned as methods used during that specific period, which makes them incorrect. Creating a multiple-choice question in this manner ensures a test of the reader's comprehension of the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Living things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Which process moves an ion across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient? What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"The process that moves an ion across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient is known as active transport. Active transport is a cellular process that moves ions or molecules across a cell membrane into a region of higher concentration, with the utilization of energy, typically in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - a key energy 'currency' within cells. Active transport is crucial for a cell's survival and proper function. It involves molecular movement - from where substances are less concentrated to areas of high concentration. This flow is considered 'against the gradient' or 'up the gradient', as it occurs against the natural diffusion direction where molecules move from areas of high concentration to regions of low concentration. Active transport embarks on two paths: primary and secondary active transport. Primary active transport directly utilizes chemical energy (ATP) to transport all species of ions across the membrane. The ATP hydrolysis powers this process which engenders a specific conformational change in the transport protein moving the ions or molecules across the membrane. An example of a protein involved in this primary active transport is the Sodium-Potassium pump, which helps neurons transmit signals through the nervous system. Secondary active transport, on the other hand, involves the use of an electrochemical gradient. This type of active transport uses energy from an ATP-driven pump (primary transport) that indirectly drives the transport of other substances. In the scope of human health and medicine, active transport is important as it helps maintain the balance of ions (such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium) that control the osmosis level, regulate nociception and maintain critical body functions like heart rhythm, muscle contraction, and brain function. It also plays a significant role in absorbing nutrients in the intestines and kidneys. So, in summary, the process that results in the movement of ions across a cell membrane against the concentration gradient is termed active transport, primarily powered by ATP. This process, vital for numerous cellular functions, allows cells to maintain internal concentrations of small molecules that differ from concentrations in the external environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: A. rude B. talented C. lazy Answer:","output":"Remy can be best described as B. talented, based on the information provided. This is because collaborating with Quinn for practicing her lines in order to secure a part in the play showcases Remy's dedication and commitment to helping others improve in their acting skills. Moreover, this action speaks to Remy's skill as an actor, given that rehearsing with other performers requires a certain level of mastery in one's own acting abilities. By assisting Quinn, Remy has demonstrated not only a command of acting techniques but also the ability to effectively communicate and support others in grasping these techniques. Additionally, Remy's decision to help Quinn is emblematic of a generous and empathetic nature, which is indicative of a strong emotional intelligence. Often, such qualities are integral components of a talented individual, as they manifest in the form of excellent collaboration skills, adaptability, and the capacity to inspire and elevate the performance of others. While the options A. rude and C. lazy were also given, we can deduce that neither of these characteristics apply to Remy in this specific context. Remy's actions in assisting Quinn reveal exactly the opposite traits. There is no evidence to suggest that Remy is rude or dismissive in this scenario, and dedicating time to help someone else secure a part in a play refutes any assumption of laziness. In conclusion, based on Remy's act of rehearsing with Quinn to help her prepare for a part in the play, it is safe to acknowledge that Remy is a talented individual.

Does it follow that \\"He believes his dead son is looking out for him.\\"? Possible answers: I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell. III. no.","output":"I. yes. The statement \\"He said his son is looking out for him from beyond the grave\\" implies that he believes his dead son is looking out for him. This is because the phrase \\"beyond the grave\\" refers to someone who has passed away, and \\"looking out for him\\" suggests that the dead son is still somehow watching over or protecting his father. Therefore, the correct answer is I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell - This answer is incorrect because the given statement clearly conveys that the person believes his dead son is looking out for him from beyond the grave. III. no - This answer is also incorrect for the same reason as answer II. The statement clearly implies that the person believes his dead son is looking out for him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F). Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen. What is one of the thermochemical processes that has been explored besides electrolysis?","output":"One of the thermochemical processes explored for hydrogen production besides electrolysis is the use of solar concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F).
