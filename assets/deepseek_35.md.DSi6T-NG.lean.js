Please write a short summary for the following article: Foursquare, Facebook and Gilt Groupe embrace hackathons NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Throw a bunch of programmers into a room with laptops, Red Bull and pizza for a hours at a stretch and what do you get? Creative breakthroughs. That's the idea behind \\"hackathons,\\" where groups of engineers band together for marathon coding sessions. The term \\"hacking\\" tends to come with negative connotations, but in the tech world, it simply means cranking out code for a cause. \\"Hacking really doesn't mean I'm going to break into a system and steal people's identities,\\" says Gilt Groupe engineer Mark Wunsch. \\"It means we're going to try and come up with clever solutions for problems.\\" Hackathons are typically off-the-cuff events with loose guiding goals, and open-source developers are among their biggest evangelists. But lately, companies have been adopting the idea. Online fashion retailer Gilt Groupe recently held its second hackathon to invent and improve on features for its website. Armed with coffee and snacks, staff engineers set up shop at 11 a.m. on a Thursday morning and prepared to spend 24 straight hours coding. \\"It gave us a chance to actually focus on one thing,\\" says developer Evan Maloney. \\"There's something else that happens with the creative process when you've been awake for a while, where you start to have ideas that you may not necessarily have if you had your wits about you.\\" A full day later -- noticeably more exhausted -- the group presented their creations. One new app they created detects the color of any object you point your smartphone at. It will then show everything the website has for sale in that color. Gilt Group isn't the only company using hackathons to spark corporate creativity. Facebook makes them a regular feature of its product development process. \\"Hacking is a central part of Facebook's culture,\\" the company wrote on its blog in December. \\"Whether we're building the next big product at one of our Hackathons or creating a smarter search algorithm, we're always hacking to find a better way of doing things.\\" Location-based network Foursquare recently hosted its first Hackathon. More than 150 developers spent a day building new features on top of the company's API. Fifteen hours -- plus 25 pizzas and 300 cups of coffee later -- engineers came up with 39 apps built on Foursquare's infrastructure. \\"It definitely helps kickstart creativity,\\" says programmer Jonathan Wegener, who took a break from working on his own venture -- part of startup accelerator TechStars' first New York cohort -- to participate. In one day, Wegener created a feature for Foursquare users called 4squareand7yearsago, which sends users a daily history of their check-ins a year ago. And as startup valuations soar and tech companies battle to find engineers, it can't hurt to gather a group of talented engineers in a room for 24 hours to see what they're capable of. \\"It's often secretly about recruiting,\\" Wegener says. Summary:","output":"Hackathons are special events where engineers and programmers work together for a long time, usually 24 hours, to create new things and solve problems. They drink lots of coffee and eat pizza to stay awake and focused. Big companies, like Facebook and Gilt Groupe, use hackathons to make their products better by creating new features and ideas. These events are fun and can also help companies find talented people to work for them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer this question: With which sport is Babe Ruth associated?","output":"Babe Ruth, born George Herman Ruth Jr. on February 6, 1895, in Baltimore, Maryland, is primarily associated with the sport of baseball. He is considered one of the most iconic and influential players in the history of the game. Babe Ruth's impact on baseball is widespread and pervasive, as he played a crucial role in transforming and popularizing the sport during its early years in the United States. Ruth began his professional baseball career as a left-handed pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles in the minor leagues. However, his contract was soon purchased by the Boston Red Sox in 1914, and he made his Major League debut later that year. During his time with the Red Sox, Ruth further developed his pitching skills and became one of the league's best pitchers. He participated in five World Series championships with the Red Sox, winning three of them (in 1915, 1916, and 1918). Although Babe Ruth's early career was marked by his skills as a pitcher, his exceptional ability as a batter would eventually come to define his legacy. Ruth's ability to hit home runs with tremendous power and frequency quickly became apparent, and he began to transition to a more offensive role as an outfielder. This change in his position allowed him to focus on his incredible hitting prowess, and ultimately altered the trajectory of the sport itself. In 1920, Ruth's contract was sold to the New York Yankees – a move that would spark the beginning of one of the most storied periods of success for the Yankees franchise. With the Yankees, Ruth's home run totals began to skyrocket, breaking numerous records along the way. Throughout his career with the Yankees, Ruth led the team to four additional World Series championships (in 1923, 1927, 1928, and 1932). Babe Ruth's impact on baseball cannot be overstated. His success brought national attention to the sport of baseball and revolutionized the way the game was played. His powerful and frequent home runs challenged the emphasis on the small-ball strategies that were common during the \\"dead-ball era,\\" shifting the focus towards greater offensive production and larger-than-life personalities. He became the face of Major League Baseball and garnered an immense fan following, attracting larger crowds and gaining widespread media attention. In addition to his athletic prowess, Babe Ruth was known for his larger-than-life personality and enthusiastic embrace of the spotlight. Stories about his personal life grew into legends, and his larger-than-life persona further extended his fame, resonating with the American public and baseball fans alike. Babe Ruth retired from baseball in 1935 and was one of the first five players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. Even after his death on August 16, 1948, his impact on the sport and his enduring fame continue to influence the game of baseball. Ruth's contributions to the sport have left an indelible mark that is still recognized and celebrated in the modern era."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jet Blue employee Steven Slater, 38, of Belle Harbor, Queens, was arraigned Tuesday on reckless endangerment and other charges after the dramatic incident Monday afternoon. Despite the felony charges, Slater's been elevated to folk-hero status by thousands who shrugged off allegations that he endangered others and praised him for his take-this-job-and-shove-it moment.      Slater's mother, Diane, even went so far as to seem proud of her son for his outburst.      \\"I can understand why he snapped.

When asked how he felt about all the outpouring of support Slater said, \\"It's been very very appreciated. It seems like something here has resonated with a few people. That's kinda neat!\\"      Courthouse sources told NBCNewYork that Slater was overheard saying \\"he's not sure how quickly he can make bail.\\" After failing to post bail, he was taken by bus to the Vernon C. Bain intake center in the South Bronx, a jail facility on a barge.      Slater was working on Flight 1052 from Pittsburgh to Kennedy Airport, which landed at around 12 p.m. Monday, when he got into a verbal altercation with a passenger -- a now legendary exploit, which has even been immortalized in a CGI video by the same Taiwanese company that make the Tiger Woods and Al Gore animations.      Following a heated exchange, the flight attendant told off the entire plane on the public address system, activated an emergency chute near the back of the plane and jumped down the evacuation slide and ran for it.      The Assistant District Attorney said the altercation began before the plane left Pittsburgh, when two passengers got in an argument over an oversized piece of luggage and the overhead compartments.      At the arraignment, defense attorney Howard Turman said Slater was under stress because his mother has lung cancer. Afterward, he provided reporters with a different account of what happened aboard the aircraft than the version initially offered by authorities.      Police had said Slater became angry when after a rule-breaking passenger defied requests to stay seated then accidentally hit him in the head with her luggage.      Turman said the dispute had begun earlier, when the flight was still waiting to take off from Pittsburgh, when two female passengers got into an argument over space in the overhead bins. That's when Slater was struck in the head, Turman said.      The dispute flared up again after the plane landed in New York when one of the women, who had been asked to gate-check her bag, was enraged that it wasn't immediately available.      \\"The woman was outraged and cursed him out a great deal,\\" Turman said. \\"At some point, I think he just wanted to avoid conflict with her.\\"      Slater asked for an apology but the irate passenger cursed him out, saying in effect \\"go f--k yourself\\" and calling him a \\"mo-fo,\\" according to law enforcement source      Turman said the woman \\"cursed him out using the f-word both as a verb and an adjective.\\"      Prosecutors said that at some point, Slater addressed the passengers on the intercom.      \\"Those of you who have shown dignity and respect these last 20 years, thanks for a great ride,\\" he said, according to prosecutors.      Slater then activated the aircraft emergency slide on door R-2, proceeded to the chute, looked down to ensure that nobody was below it as he had been trained to do, and he deployed the device and went down it safely, his attorney said.      He also grabbed some beer from the galley before he took the plunge and then headed for the AirTrain, where other passengers from the flight reportedly saw him on the way home.      Slater was later arrested at his home in Belle Harbor by Port Authority officials. Police sources said that when authorities found Slater he seemed to be in the midst having sexual relations.      He is being charged with 2nd-and 4th-degree criminal mischief, 1st- and 2nd-degree reckless endangerment and criminal trespass in the 3rd degree, according to a spokeswoman for Queens DA Richard Brown. Slater faces up to 7 years in prison if convicted.      Judge Mary O'Donoghue also granted an order of protection preventing Slater from contacting the pilot of the flight or a JetBlue employee who investigated the incident.      Prosecutors said the emergency escape slide deploys at 3,000 pounds of pressure per square inch and \\"causes a risk of serious physical injury or death if it strikes people working under the aircraft.\\" They also said the cost to replace the escape slide is 25,000, according to Jet Blue security.      But no one was injured in the incident and JetBlue, in a statement, added, \\"At no time was the security or safety of our customers or crew members at risk.\\"      Slater, a 38-year-old airline veteran who lives steps from the Queens beach a few miles from the airport, had been flying long enough to see much of the gleam of the air travel experience tarnished by frayed nerves, rising fees, plummeting airline profits and packed cabins.            \\"One by one all of these niceties have been removed from the customer experience. I think subconsciously, it's causing passengers to be very angry,'' said Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer Guides and daughter of Arthur Frommer. \\"There's an us-versus-them mentality.''            Sentiment online appeared to fall in Slater's court. By early Tuesday afternoon, more than 20,000 people had declared themselves supporters of Slater on Facebook, and the number was growing by thousands every hour. At least one fan set up a legal fund on his behalf.            \\"Overwhelmingly people said it should have been the passenger who was ejected from the plane,'' said George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, speaking about response to his site's blog on the incident. \\"I've never seen such an outpouring of support for a flight attendant.''

We have the equation: r = -r - 2 First, let's put all the r's on the same side of the equation. To do that, we will add r to both sides of the equation. When we do that, we get: r + r = -r + r - 2 Now, r + r is the same as 2r (because we have two r's added together), so our equation becomes: 2r = -2 Now, we want to isolate r by itself. Since r is being multiplied by 2, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2, like this: 2r ÷ 2 = -2 ÷ 2 When we do that, we find: r = -1 So, r = -1 is the solution to the equation r = -r - 2.

Question: \\"In what year did the civil war introduced at the beginning of the passage officially end?\\"  Context: \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The civil war officially ended in 1997, when a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

A:","output":"No, the right answer to the question, \\"What step are bees essential in during the sexual reproduction of plants?\\" is not \\"death.\\" Instead, bees play a critical role in the pollination step of the sexual reproduction process in plants. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive structures (anthers) to the female reproductive structures (stigmas) in plants, which is required for fertilization and the production of seeds. Bees, belonging to the group of animals called pollinators, are essential for the pollination process, as they facilitate the transfer of pollen between flowers while searching for nectar. They unknowingly carry pollen from one flower to another as the pollen sticks to the hairs on their bodies, especially on their legs. This transfer of pollen allows for the mixing of genetic materials between different flowers, increasing genetic diversity and, consequently, the overall health and resilience of plant populations. The process begins when a bee lands on a flower to gather nectar, a sugary liquid produced by the plant as it entices pollinators. As the bee inserts its long, tubular mouthpart called a proboscis into the flower to collect nectar, the flower's male reproductive organs, called stamens, come into contact with the bee's body. Pollen grains from the anther, the pollen-producing part of the stamen, stick to the bee's hairs. When the bee moves to another flower to collect more nectar, some of these pollen grains transfer from the bee's body to the female reproductive organ, the stigma, on the new flower.  Once pollen lands on the stigma, it germinates and forms a pollen tube, which grows down through the style until it reaches the ovary containing ovules. The sperm cells within the pollen tube then fertilize the ovules, leading to the creation of seeds. These seeds, encapsulated within a protective structure called the fruit produced by the plant, are then dispersed into the environment. This dispersal allows the plants to reproduce and spread across the landscape. In summary, bees contribute significantly to the fertilization process in the sexual reproduction of plants by transferring pollen between flowers during the pollination process. The concept of \\"death\\" is not an appropriate answer. Bees are essential for both the survival of the plants they pollinate and the overall health of the ecosystems they inhabit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery Answer:","output":"The final step in the process of blood filtration by the kidneys involves returning the filtered blood back to the body's circulatory system and eliminating the waste products as urine. Once the blood has been processed through the millions of tiny nephrons and waste products have been removed, the purified blood is collected in the renal vein and returned to the body's circulatory system. The renal vein is a blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood away from the kidneys, connecting to the inferior vena cava, which ultimately transports the blood back to the heart. This ensures that the rest of the body's organs and tissues receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Meanwhile, the waste products removed from the blood by the nephrons form urine. As urine is produced in each nephron, it merges into a network of collecting ducts within the kidney. The collecting ducts then converge to form the renal pelvis, which acts as a funnel-shaped chamber that channels the urine into the ureters. The ureters are a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder, allowing urine to be transported out of the kidneys. Upon reaching the bladder, the urine is temporarily stored until it reaches a certain volume. Once the bladder is full, a signal is sent to the brain, which triggers the urge to urinate. During urination, the urine travels through the urethra, a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body, and is ultimately expelled. In summary, the final step of the process involves returning the filtered blood back to the body's circulatory system through the renal vein while simultaneously eliminating the waste products as urine through the ureters, bladder, and urethra. By completing this vital process, the kidneys help maintain the body's overall health and homeostasis by managing waste elimination, regulating electrolyte balance, and controlling blood pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The Age of Enlightenment is a time in Western philosophy and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: The term \\"studia humanitatis\\" refers to the study of humanities during the Renaissance period, which took place roughly between the 14th and 17th centuries. This educational reform sought to revive the classical educational curriculum, promoting the study of grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy based on the works of ancient Greek and Roman authors. During the Renaissance, the studia humanitatis was competing against Scholasticism, a predominant method of teaching and philosophizing in medieval Europe. Scholasticism primarily focused on theology and logic, as well as the works of Aristotle and other philosophers as interpreted by Christian theologians. The dispute between these two educational approaches was significant because it marked a turning point in European intellectual history. While Scholasticism had a strong religious foundation and was closely tied to ecclesiastical institutions, the studia humanitatis aimed at a more comprehensive understanding of human culture and emphasized the need for a well-rounded education. There were several factors that contributed to the rise of studia humanitatis and the decline of Scholasticism: 1. The rediscovery of classical texts: During the Renaissance, there was a surge of interest in classical literature, fueled by the rediscovery of many ancient Greek and Roman texts that had been lost during the Middle Ages. This newfound appreciation for classical works shifted the focus of education from theology to secular subjects, promoting the study of humanities. 2. Humanism: The Renaissance humanist movement sought to reestablish the cultural and literary values of classical antiquity. Humanists believed that a broader education, encompassing poetry, history, and moral philosophy, would lead to a more well-rounded, morally upright individual. 3. The rise of vernacular literature: During the Renaissance, there was a growing appreciation for vernacular literatures, further reducing the importance of Latin scholasticism. Writers such as Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio paved the way for a new literary tradition that would be accessible to a wider audience. 4. Church criticism: Scholasticism was increasingly seen as dogmatic and out of touch with the realities of everyday life. The emergence of reform movements like Protestantism and the growth of anticlerical sentiment undermined the authority of the Church and questioned its monopoly on education. 5. Political and intellectual independence: The rise of city-states in Italy, where the Renaissance began, created an environment where scholars and artists could work independently from the Church or other ecclesiastical institutions. This promoted a spirit of intellectual freedom that fostered the development of humanist education. In conclusion, the studia humanitatis of the Renaissance period competed against the prevailing Scholasticism by promoting a more comprehensive, human-centered education based on classical texts and values. Scholasticism, which was primarily focused on theology and logic, was increasingly seen as dogmatic, and its decline paved the way for the spread of humanist education and the emergence of modern philosophy and literature."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Throughout much of the 1990s Glen Jakovich was regarded as the premier centre half back in the AFL, and his battles with Carey were a talking point and a season highlight whenever the Eagles and Kangaroos met. Jakovich was one of the very few players who could match Carey for strength in a one-on-one contest and as a result he was often able to limit Careys dominance. The rivalry gained significant media attention during 1995 when the pair met three times, with Carey being held to a combined total of just 7 marks, 35 disposals and 2 goals. Carey had dominated their encounters in 1993 and 1994, polling Brownlow votes in two out of three games. Statistically, Jakovich held Carey to fewer disposals and goals than any other player could consistently manage. In all they played against each other 18 times-16 while Carey was at North Melbourne and two when he was at Adelaide-first meeting in round 12 of 1992 and last in round 19 of 2003, with Jakovich being able to hold Carey to averages of 6 marks, 14 disposals and 2.1 goals per game. By comparison, in the 188 games Carey played against all other opponents in the same period, he averaged 7 marks, 18 disposals and 3.0 goals per game. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many more goals per game was Jakovich able to hold other opponents as compared to Carey?","output":"To answer the question, we need to compare the average goals per game Carey scored against Jakovich to the average goals per game Carey scored against all other opponents. From the given text, Carey averaged 2.1 goals per game against Jakovich and 3.0 goals per game against all other opponents. So, to find the difference in goals per game, we subtract Carey's average goals per game against Jakovich from his average against all other opponents: 3.0 goals per game (against all other opponents) - 2.1 goals per game (against Jakovich) = 0.9 goals per game Thus, Jakovich was able to hold Carey to 0.9 fewer goals per game compared to all other opponents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

White House adviser Susan Rice says Congress must regain US Unesco vote The White House national security adviser Susan Rice on Saturday urged Congress to allow the US to regain its vote at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (Unesco), which it lost for not paying dues. Using Twitter, Rice said: Unesco on Friday suspended the voting rights of the US and Israel, two years after both countries stopped paying dues to the UN's cultural arm, to protest its granting full membership to the Palestinians. The US decision to cancel its funding in October 2011 was blamed on American laws that prohibit funding to any UN agency that implies recognition of the Palestinians' demands for their own state. The withdrawal of US funding – which totaled about 240m, or some 22% of Unesco's budget – has plunged it into a funding crisis and forced it to cut programs. Unesco is responsible for designating World Heritage sites, promoting global education and supporting press freedom, among other tasks. Analysts have said that by losing its vote, the US is foregoing an important opportunity to exercise \\"soft power\\" – the ability to exert international influence through other means than brute force or money. That gap is likely to be filled by other emerging global powers, such as China, they say. \\"Unesco directly advances US interests in supporting girls' and women's education, facilitating important scientific research, promoting tolerance, protecting and preserving the world's natural and cultural heritage, supporting freedom of the press, and much more,\\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Friday. It is not the first time the US has been at odds with Unesco. Washington withdrew from the agency in 1984, complaining of wasteful bureaucracy and a third-world bias. The US rejoined the agency in 2002 under President George W Bush, who said it had undertaken needed reforms.

Given the following context:  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged?","output":"The name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged is Saint-Saëns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- In a country with a flourishing porn industry and an annual penis festival, it may come as a surprise that an artist with a mission to make female genitalia \\"more casual and pop\\" has run afoul of authorities. But in Japan, a conceptual artist known for creating works inspired by her genitals is being held by Tokyo police on charges of sharing obscene material electronically. Megumi Igarashi, who goes by the pseudonym Rokudenashiko (which means \\"good-for-nothing kid\\"), launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise money to build a kayak in the shape of her vagina using a 3-D printer. Many critics of her arrest have pointed out that OPTIONS: - 3-D only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - CNN only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - Igarashi only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - Japan only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - Megumi Igarashi only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - Rokudenashiko only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. - Tokyo only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons.","output":"Many critics of her arrest have pointed out that Japan only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. This contradiction in the country's policies highlights a complex and multifaceted issue involving cultural norms, legal standards, and the portrayal of sexuality in art and entertainment. The fact that Japan only recently implemented a ban on child pornography, while continuing to permit explicit animated content, raises questions about the nation's priorities and the extent to which artistic freedom is truly respected. Some critics argue that the ban on child pornography does not go far enough, as it fails to address the exploitation of children in animated forms. Others contend that the ban reflects a form of selective censorship that unfairly targets certain types of sexual expression while disregarding others. Megumi Igarashi's arrest demonstrates the fine line between art and obscenity as perceived by Japanese authorities. Her artwork, which seeks to challenge taboos surrounding female genitalia, pushes the boundaries of cultural norms in Japan—a society that openly celebrates the male phallus in events like the annual penis festival. While Igarashi's 3-D printed kayak serves as a critique of these gendered double standards, her arrest and subsequent charge for sharing obscene material electronically illuminate the challenges that artists like her face in engaging with controversial subject matter. Proponents of artistic freedom argue that Igarashi's work pushes society to confront and reassess its understanding of female sexuality and that her arrest represents an infringement on her right to self-expression. Detractors, on the other hand, may view her art as an unnecessary provocation or inappropriate appropriation of sexual imagery. Ultimately, Igarashi's case exposes the tensions and contradictions that are inherent in any society grappling with the intersection of art, technology, and sexual expression. As Japan and other countries continue to evolve their legal and cultural frameworks to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of digital technology, they must also confront the complicated moral and ethical questions that define the boundaries of artistic freedom and public decency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- There are several reasons why Yann Martel's Man Booker prize-winning novel \\"Life of Pi\\" was considered unfilmable when it was published in 2001. That most of the story takes place on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean surely didn't help. That the shipwrecked hero, a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel -- \\"Pi\\" for short -- didn't have another human soul to talk to for 200 days presented another significant challenge. But the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be Richard Parker, the full-grown 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with Pi.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\".

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the...  - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it.

The president reiterated that U.S. forces will not remain \\"a single day longer\\" than necessary, that he remains committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by September and that he will stick to a 2014 deadline to fully withdraw from Afghanistan. \\"We will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains,\\" the president said during a nationally televised speech to the U.S. people from Bagram Air Base early on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in the United States). \\"That will be the job of the Afghan people.\\" Addressing Afghan concerns that America will abandon the country once its troops leave,","output":"Obama reassured them that the United States is not seeking a permanent military presence in Afghanistan and will continue to support Afghan development and security. \\"As you stand up, you will not stand alone,\\" the president said, emphasizing America's commitment to the enduring partnership with the Afghan people. The strategic partnership agreement, inked by Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, outlines the framework for supporting Afghanistan once U.S. combat troops are withdrawn. This includes commitments to economic development, education initiatives, and continued training and support for Afghan security forces to ensure stability and a smooth transition of power. In his speech, Obama also recognized the immense sacrifices made by American and Afghan forces, as well as the hardships faced by the local population. He acknowledged the difficult journey ahead and stressed the importance of combating corruption, strengthening democratic institutions, and promoting human rights to build a better future for Afghanistan. The president's surprise visit to Afghanistan highlights the significance of the strategic partnership agreement and underscores the United States' ongoing commitment to the region. While challenges remain, the agreement represents a significant milestone in Afghanistan's path towards stability, independence, and self-reliance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: When you meet someone for the first time, do you put across a good impression? And what do we mean by \\"good\\" in the context? According to Presence, a new book by Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy, people assess you on two main criteria when they first meet you: 1. Can I trust this person? 2. Can I respect this person? Your level of trustworthiness, or warmth, is the most important factor in how people initially admire you, Cuddy says-yet many mistakenly believe that the second factor,characterised as competence, is more important.\\"From an evolutionary aspect,\\"Cuddy writes,\\"it is more important to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\\" While displaying competence is certainly beneficial, particularly in a work setting, Cuddy warns that focusing on winning people's respect, while failing to win their trust, can backfire-a common problem for young professionals attempting to make a good impression early on in their careers. \\"If someone you're trying to influence doesn't trust you, you're not going to get very far\\", Cuddy says, \\"A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits  admiration, but only after you've established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.\\" In Cuddy's book she also explains some of the science that can help you spot a liar. When a person is lying there is likely to be differences between what they are saying and what they are doing, she suggests. \\"Lying is hard work,\\" she writes, \\"We're telling one story while suppressing another, and most of us are experiencing psychological guilt about doing this, which we're also trying suppress.

Question: Question: \\"Why are proton pumps necessary for nutrient uptake?\\"  Context: \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Proton pumps play an essential role in nutrient uptake for plants, facilitating the efficient absorption of essential elements from the soil and air. These elements are crucial for various biological processes and overall plant development and growth. To understand why proton pumps are necessary, it is important to delve deeper into the key mechanisms involved in nutrient uptake, cation exchange, and the process of photosynthesis. First and foremost, proton pumps can be primarily located on the plasma membrane of root hair cells, and they function by actively transporting hydrogen ions (H+) out of the plant cells into the surrounding soil. This active transport requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is utilized to move the hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient. Proton pumps contribute significantly to nutrient uptake by inducing cation exchange in the soil. Cation exchange is a vital process wherein root hairs release H+ ions into the soil through proton pumps. The concentration of H+ ions in the soil leads to the displacement of positively charged mineral ions or cations, such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+), that are attached to negatively charged soil particles called colloids. Consequently, the freed cations become available for the plant roots to absorb and use for various biochemical processes. One reason proton pumps are necessary for nutrient uptake is that they create a favorable electrochemical gradient for nutrient absorption. When hydrogen ions are pumped out of the plant cell, the cell becomes more negatively charged relative to the soil. This difference in charge makes it energetically favorable for positively charged nutrients like K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ to move into the plant cell via various ion channels and transporters. In addition, the gradient of H+ concentration between the extracellular environment and the root cells can also drive the uptake of other essential nutrients like anions (negatively charged ions) through symport or antiport mechanisms. In the context of nutrient uptake from air, stomata are specialized structures on the leaves that facilitate the exchange of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). CO2, taken in from the air, serves as the primary carbon source for photosynthesis – a process where plants capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy, producing glucose molecules. Proton pumps indirectly influence this process by maintaining a constant pH balance in the plant cells, which is essential for the optimal functioning of enzymes and other cellular processes involved in photosynthesis. Proton pumps also contribute to the regulation of stomatal opening and closure, further affecting CO2 uptake and water use efficiency. By manipulating the movement of ions into and out of specific cells surrounding the stomata, plant cells can modify the turgor pressure and subsequently control the stomatal aperture size. This regulation allows plants to optimize their photosynthetic capacity while avoiding excessive water loss through evapotranspiration. In summary, proton pumps are necessary for nutrient uptake in plants due to their crucial role in facilitating cation exchange, maintaining electrochemical gradients, and indirectly optimizing photosynthesis. Proton pumps enable efficient absorption of essential elements from the soil and air, thereby providing the necessary nutrients for plant growth, development, and overall health."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Movie title: The Last Unicorn Movie plot: In an enchanted forest, a talking unicorn learns she is the very last of her kind. A butterfly reveals that a demonic animal called the Red Bull herded her kind to the ends of the earth. Venturing into unfamiliar territory beyond the safety of her home, the Unicorn journeys to find them and bring them all back. Upon her journey the Unicorn is captured by the evil witch Mommy Fortuna, and is put on display in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. As most of the attractions are normal animals with a spell of illusion placed on them (to wit, a toothless lion for a Manticore, a crippled chimpanzee for a Satyr, and a mere snake for the \\"Midgard Serpent\\"), Fortuna uses a spell to create another horn on the unicorn's head that the non-magical carnival visitors can see, as they are unable to see her real form. Fortuna keeps the immortal harpy Celaeno captive as well and acknowledges the dangers of caging such a monster, but deems the risk secondary to the deed's recognition and prestige. While held captive, the unicorn is befriended by Schmendrick, an incompetent magician in the service of Mommy Fortuna. With the help of Schmendrick, the Unicorn escapes, in the process freeing Celaeno, who kills Fortuna and her henchman Ruhk. The Unicorn and Schmendrick later gain a second traveling companion Molly Grue, the careworn lover of Captain Cully (the disappointing \\"reality\\" behind the Robin Hood legend). When the Unicorn nears the seaside castle of King Haggard, supposed keeper of the Red Bull, she encounters the animal, which turns out to be a monstrous fire elemental. At the last moment before her capture, Schmendrick uses his unpredictable magic, and transforms her into a human woman with white knee-length hair. In this guise, the Red Bull is uninterested in her and departs. The Unicorn suffers tremendous shock at the feeling of mortality in her body.

Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population.

With the  Options are: * leg pain I'm able to get around on crutches. * back pain I'm able to get around on crutches.","output":"With leg pain, I'm able to get around on crutches. The main difference, of course, between back pain and leg pain is that the former affects the entire body and how it moves, whereas the latter can be alleviated somewhat with the use of mobility aids, such as crutches. Leg pain, though undoubtedly painful and uncomfortable, does admittedly present the advantage of allowing you to remain at least somewhat mobile and independent. In stark contrast to back pain – which often hinders your very capacity to assume an upright position without experiencing crippling discomfort – an injured leg can be partially relieved of pressure and strain by transferring weight to the crutches, and thus effectively allowing the user to bypass the full extent of their pain. The situation, of course, would be entirely different were it the back that was the focus of the problem, as back pain tends to impose pervasive, agonizing limitations on all movements, rendering even the most minor of tasks unbearable. Crutches are particularly advantageous in managing leg pain through their adjustable nature, which permits them to be customized to the individual's unique size and requirements. Moreover, in regard to those who are partial-weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing, crutches can act as a lifeline – strong and stable – thereby promoting recuperation over time. This highly beneficial aspect, unfortunately, just isn't feasible with back pain, which leaves the individual largely helpless and immobile. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that leg pain remains a challenge that shouldn't be underrated, as it still necessitates much patience, perseverance, and adaptability during the healing process. Walking on crutches requires finding a new balance, learning to ascend and descend stairs, and mustering the physical stamina to withstand the toll it takes on your arms and remaining leg. Additionally, leg pain has a profound effect on one's daily life, as quality of sleep is often compromised and driving a car may become complicated or even impossible. Regardless, it remains irrefutable that the ability to move around – albeit with the assistance of crutches – represents a substantial advantage in comparison to the debilitating nature of back pain. Leg pain, while undoubtedly restricting and distressing, continues to afford one some semblance of independence and autonomy in their day-to-day life. In contrast, back pain often leaves you confined, immobile, and suffering in isolation, relying on the goodwill of others while attempting to simply make it through each day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

At 95, an elderly man from Denmark is still able to lift weights that most people a quarter of his age wouldn't be able to budge from the ground. Even more astonishingly, it was only two-and-a-half years ago that powerlifter Svend Stensgaard was rushed to hospital after having a heart attack. Yet a video filmed of him working out at the gym - in a room full of boys young enough to be his great-grandchildren - proves just how fit and healthy he is in later life. In the footage, the jacked Dane defies stereotypes of pensioners as frail and feeble beings clad in their bedroom slippers. Both standing and lying on his back, he is seen shifting a whopping 290 pounds of weight as he controls his breathing to establish a rhythm. Mr Stensgaard says in the interview that exercising, which releases a lot of stress-fighting endorphins, is comparable to a 'dosage of morphine' for him. Power pa: Svend Stensgaard, 95, showcases his impressive strength while powerlifting at his local gym in Denmark. Superman! The pensioner suffered a heart attack more than two years ago but that has not stopped him from doing what he loves the most. He explains that those closest to him are 'very impressed and also amazed' that he has continued to train despite his recent health troubles. 'I could barely lift more than 1kg in each hand,' he recalls. 'And so to add to their admiration, I lifted 130 kg in a deadlift.' At the end of the video, Mr Stensgaard adds that he was born to do this and has no plans to stop despite growing older. It gives him something pleasurable to do and look forward to. 'For me, I exercise because I can't think of myself sitting at home and doing nothing.' Determined: After suffering health problems, he could barely lift 1kg but now he is back to shifting 290 pounds above his head.

[B]. positive.).","output":"[A]. Negative: Title: \\"Disappointment on the Horizon\\" The long-awaited movie adaptation of the best-selling novel 'Disappointment on the Horizon' has unfortunately fallen far short of the hype and anticipation that preceded its release. Despite a star-studded cast and an award-winning director, the film ultimately fails to capture the essence of the source material and leaves the audience with feelings of immense disappointment and dissatisfaction. From the very beginning, the movie suffers from poor pacing and a convoluted storytelling structure that never allows the audience to truly immerse themselves in the world created by the novel. Several key plot points are brushed over or eliminated entirely, leaving viewers who have not read the source material confused and uncertain about the overall arc of the story. As for the characters, the film's lackluster adaptation comes as a massive disservice to the talented ensemble cast. While the actors do their best with the material they're given, their performances are often hindered by underdeveloped characters and stilted dialogue that serves only to detract from the overarching story. In addition to these issues, the visual effects and cinematography leave much to be desired. The film relies on an inordinate amount of CGI, which often appears cheap and out-of-place within the context of the story. This is further exacerbated by unimaginative camera work and a drab color palette that drains the vibrancy and energy out of what could have been truly breathtaking landscape shots. Another glaring drawback of this adaptation is its painfully obvious attempt to set up a franchise. Several plot threads are left unresolved and characters are introduced only to be forgotten, making it clear that the filmmakers prioritized planning for sequels above giving audiences a satisfying and cohesive standalone film. In conclusion, 'Disappointment on the Horizon' is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved novel to the big screen. Despite the promise of a well-respected director and an impressive cast, the film crumbles beneath the weight of its own lofty ambitions and leaves the audience feeling disillusioned and disheartened. One can only hope that upcoming adaptations will take heed of this cautionary tale and opt to prioritize substance over style in their storytelling endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Adding barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses.[citation needed] Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy, for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs UV wavelengths.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons? , can you please find it?   Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... Answer:","output":"The type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons is the Blue whale. The Blue whale (scientific name: Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest creature that has ever lived, reaching up to 29.9 metres in length. Originating from the family Balaenopteridae, also known as the rorquals, Blue whales are distinguished not only for their immense size but also their blue-grey color and voluminous yet streamlined bodies.  When it comes to feeding, Blue whales mostly consume krill, small shrimp-like animals, which they filter out from the ocean water using baleen plates, fringe-like structures in their mouths. They are capable of taking in huge gulps of water and expelling the water while retaining the krill and plankton as food. This feeding mechanism is an adaptation that is shared amongst baleen whales. Blue whales are noteworthy for their impressive adaptability to life in the open ocean where they perform all essential life processes including feeding, mating, giving birth and rearing their young ones. Given their aquatic lifestyles and individual body weights, they cannot survive on land.  So, in a nutshell, the Blue whale is the type of whale that can reach a remarkable weight of up to 190 metric tons, making it the largest living creature on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Red Shoes Movie plot: Based on a Hans Christian Andersen  fairy tale about a pair of enchanted crimson ballet slippers, 'The Red Shoes'  follows the beautiful Vicky Page (Moira Shearer), a young socialite who loves ballet, the rising composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) whom she loves, and her dictatorial director, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook).After attracting the attention of the famous Director, and earning respect and admiration from her colleagues, Vicky is promised by Lermontov that- ''You shall dance, and the world shall follow'' -but only on the agreement that she will dance, and he will control everything else.On this basis, Vicky rises to fame as the prima ballerina in a world- class Ballet Company. However, Lermontov discovers the romance between his talented composer and his beautiful protege, and he cruelly dictates that Vicky must give up Julian or the dancing. He is shocked, and hurt when she marries Julian, and leaves the company, but remains convinced that she will return to him.Vicky does miss her dancing, and when she is offered the chance to dance 'The Red Shoes'  show once more, she attempts to resist, but eventually gives in to Lermontov's alternate bullying and coaxing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"Very simple, said Sir James, \\"and very ingenious.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It was simple and because of its genius, it sold well.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Very simple, said Sir James, \\"and very ingenious.\\"\\" is true, it establishes the fact that Sir James believes the subject under discussion possesses the qualities of being both simple and ingenious. However, this premise alone does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"It was simple and because of its genius, it sold well.\\"  In order to better understand this, let's analyze each component and their correlation: 1. Simplicity: The premise asserts that the object or idea being discussed is simple. This simplicity could imply various things, such as being easy to understand, having a straightforward design, or being uncomplicated in its execution. Simplicity often has a positive connotation and may be perceived as an attractive feature for potential buyers. 2. Ingenious: The premise also highlights that Sir James views the subject as ingenious, meaning that it is clever, original, or inventive. This suggests that there is some unique, innovative aspect or value to the idea or product that sets it apart from others. Typically, ingenious products or ideas may attract attention and spark interest among people. Nonetheless, while the premise highlights that the subject at hand possesses both simplicity and ingenious characteristics, it does not automatically imply that it will sell well or that its success is directly correlated to these specific attributes. Here are some reasons why: 1. Market Factors and External Influences: No matter how simple and ingenious a product or idea may be, different market forces, such as supply and demand, consumer preferences, and competition, can all impact sales success. These external factors are not considered within the premise statement and their presence or absence can influence sales performance. 2. Marketing and Promotion: The premise does not mention how the subject is marketed and promoted. Even if an idea or product is genuinely simple and ingenious, its success in sales might be impeded if it is not adequately marketed, advertised, or promoted to reach the target audience. Excellent marketing and communication efforts can significantly influence sales performance. 3. Consumer Perception and Needs: The success of a product or idea ultimately depends on whether consumers can relate to it or perceive it as something that fulfills their needs or preferences. The premise does not offer any information on how the subject is received by the target audience, how it addresses their needs or pain points, or how it is distinct from available alternatives. Moreover, relying solely on Simplicity and Ingenious attributes might not be enough to ensure the subject will sell well. 4. Timing: The launch or introduction of a product or idea plays a crucial role in determining its success. Debuting a product or idea when the market is not ready for it or when there are too many competing alternatives can negatively impact its sales. The premise does not provide any context for the timing of the subject's introduction, which could be a critical factor in determining its sales success. In conclusion, although Sir James's premise indeed indicates that the subject is simple and ingenious, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"It was simple and because of its genius, it sold well.\\" To connect the premise to sales success, more information is needed, such as external market forces, marketing efforts, consumer behavior, and timing. The relationship between the product or idea's simplicity and ingenious attributes and its potential for sales success is not explicitly guaranteed based on the premise alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  Which island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to consider the impact of the weather conditions on the food supply and consequently, on the finch population and beak size. Step 1: Understand the effect of weather conditions on the food supply. - Port island experienced wet weather over 3 summers, meaning the availability of seeds would be relatively high. - Bank island experienced severe drought, leading to a reduced food supply for the birds. Step 2: Analyze how the food supply would affect the finch population and their beak sizes. - On Port island, with an abundance of seeds, birds with both small and large beaks will likely have sufficient food sources. - On Bank island, due to the drought and decreased seed availability, smaller-beaked birds that can only eat small seeds may struggle to survive. Larger-beaked birds capable of eating all seed sizes will have an advantage in this scenario. Step 3: Determine which island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce. - On Port island, since food supply isn't a significant issue, birds with both small and large beaks should be able to reproduce without any constraints related to beak size. - On Bank island, birds with larger beaks are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their traits. This leads to an increase in the proportion of birds with larger beaks in the population. Considering these steps, it is evident that Port island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce. The favorable weather conditions on Port island provided sufficient resources for birds with both small and large beaks to survive and reproduce, whereas on Bank island, the drought created an environment where birds with larger beaks had an advantage in reproducing and passing on their traits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70%. In 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point (duration TOF70) was 66.7 min in the control group (no antagonist), 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium. The duration TOF70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01) groups. The duration TOF70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group. In 29 patients given atracurium, the durations TOF70 were 66.4, 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control, neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively. The durations TOF70 in the neostigmine (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01), groups were shorter than control. The duration TOF70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01).

With thousands of Russian troops still posted near the Ukrainian border and Ukraine's military putting increasing pressure on pro-Russian fighters around the city of Donetsk, many in Ukraine and elsewhere fear that the so-called humanitarian mission is actually an attempt to smuggle supplies to pro-Russian rebels. \\"Russia keeps inventing new excuses for their policy,\\" Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Danylo Lubkivsky, said Tuesday in Kiev. \\"In Georgia, it was defending pro-Russian minorities.

Look for a product advertised as “anti-breakage,” “strengthening,” “restorative,” or “repair.”  To apply, wet your hair in the shower and pour a coin-sized amount of shampoo into your palm. Massage it into your scalp and roots, then rinse well under cold water. These shampoos will help to seal your split ends and thicken your hair while keeping it shiny. Make sure that you rinse your hair thoroughly both before and after you apply the shampoo. Look for a conditioner that includes strengthening proteins and that’s specialized for your hair type. Pour a dollop into your palm and smooth it over your strands, from about mid-length to tips. Rinse off with cool water. once a week to renew and repair your hair. While your hair is still wet, rub a quarter-sized amount of deep conditioner between your hands. Gently massage it into your hair from mid-length to tips. Then, pin your hair back and let it soak in for 10-30 minutes.  You can place a shower cap over your head to keep the deep conditioner in place. To save time, wash and deep condition your hair at the beginning of your shower. Leave the conditioner in place while you wash your body and rinse it out at the end of your shower using cool water. Look for a deep conditioner that matches your hair type, whether that’s fine, thick, natural, or curly. The usual terry-cloth towels can create friction that damages your hair, causing split ends. Blot your hair dry with a microfiber towel instead, which soaks up excess moisture without leaving your hair too dry. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel, which can cause breakage as well. Washing your hair with “hard water”—water that contains minerals like chlorine magnesium and calcium—can damage your hair cuticles, which can weaken your hair and cause breakage. Installing a simple filtered showerhead can wash these minerals out, keeping your hair strong, soft, and shiny.  You can buy filtered showerheads online and in home stores. They can range in price from 30-100. To find out whether you have hard water in your home, check your filter for a white film. This is left behind by minerals during evaporation, indicating that you have hard water. You can also search local news sources for information on local hard water. Search “[your area] hard water.” Over-washing your hair can strip it of natural oils, leaving it more vulnerable to damage and breakage. Depending on your hair type, try to wash it as little as possible—3 times a week is a good standard to shoot for. If your hair gets oily more quickly, try a dry shampoo for a quick clean that won’t cause damage.

Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \\"shocking\\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \\"performance\\" by the lawyers. \\"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\\" Wu said. \\"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients  to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \\"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\\", Wu added.

This is because each of the possible answers you provided can reflect various aspects of Remy's state of mind in response to this new information. 1. Predictable: Remy might find the situation predictable if they have previously experienced or heard of similar circumstances. This sense of predictability might lead them to feel a bit of frustration or resignation, as it seems like outdoor events are always being disrupted by the weather. Even though the rain might be a predictable part of life, Remy would still have hoped that the weather would cooperate so that the picnic could continue as planned. 2. There will be other days: Despite the disappointment, Remy may also feel a sense of optimism in thinking that there will be other opportunities to celebrate and organize picnics in the future. This sentiment helps Remy to remain positive about the situation and not dwell too much on the unfortunate weather. It's essential to maintain a positive attitude when faced with disappointments like this to ensure that they can enjoy the picnic when it eventually takes place. 3. Others would be disappointed: Remy would likely be concerned about how this news will affect the other guests who were planning to attend the birthday picnic. In this context, empathy plays a significant role, as Remy would feel a sense of responsibility for their enjoyment and happiness, given that they were the one who organized the event. Feeling the disappointment of others adds an additional layer of worry and stress, which could contribute to a mix of emotions, including frustration and sadness. In conclusion, after checking the weather forecast and finding out that it would be rainy during the planned birthday picnic, Remy would likely feel an array of emotions ranging from predictability and disappointment to optimism and concern for others. The way they navigate these feelings and respond to the situation would ultimately depend on their ability to adapt and remain positive despite the unexpected challenges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.  After reading the above, is \\"The first figures of the Buddha were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Give an example of how Hellenized artforms were used in Indian art.\\"? Choose from:  *no.  *yes.","output":"*yes. The statement \\"The first figures of the Buddha were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo\\" is a correct answer to the question \\"Give an example of how Hellenized art forms were used in Indian art.\\" This demonstrates the influence of Greek art on Buddhist portrayals, where typical stylistic elements of Greek sculpture, such as the realistic depiction of the human figure and drapery, were incorporated into Indian art. This is part of the syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism, where Greek and Buddhist cultures merged and influenced one another. It is a prime example of Hellenization's impact on the art of regions extending beyond Greece's immediate sphere of influence, hence showing how Hellenized art forms were used in Indian art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: With hardly any women present in the colony, the Portuguese soldiers took Indian wives. Hypothesis: Portuguese soldiers when there were not enough women started forming same-sex relationships.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In order to determine if one statement entails another, it must be explained that entailment in a logical sense means the truth of one statement (the premise) will necessarily lead to the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). In this case, the premise shares information about Portuguese soldiers marrying Indian women due to a lack of women in the colony. The hypothesis, however, hypothesizes that a lack of women might lead the soldiers to form same-sex relationships.  While it is possible that these two situations could occur simultaneously in a historical context due to a lack of female companionship, the premise does not implicitly or explicitly entail the occurrence of the other. There isn't a logical necessity or implication that because soldiers married local women they would also form same-sex relationships. Thus, the entailment does not hold in this case.   This isn't to say that same-sex relationships could not or did not occur, but rather that the premise given does not provide enough information to make that claim definitively. The hypothesis is making an additional claim beyond what is stated in the premise.  In our case, if, for example, the premise had said that \\"With hardly any women present in the colony, the Portuguese soldiers took Indian wives and started forming same-sex relationships,\\" then the hypothesis would be entailed from the premise, because the new premise explicitly states both the marrying of Indian women and the formation of same-sex relationships. However, in its current form, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In logic and argumentation, it's imperative to ensure that claims and conclusions directly arise from the premises established, rather than infer or assume unspoken possibilities. The hypothesis involves an additional step that the premise doesn’t provide for, and as a result, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The function of entailment is a key aspect of logical reasoning and it's essential in avoiding the forwarding of hypotheses which could be considered logical leaps, unsupported by their preceding premises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook.

With recent performances coming under scrutiny, McGinn now has added incentive to lead Hibernian to a strong finish, ensuring they silence any critics and prove their worth within the Scottish Premiership. Hibernian, who currently sit mid-table, have had a mixed campaign in the 2020/21 season. While they have managed to secure several impressive wins, they have also experienced inconsistent performances and surprising losses. The inconsistency has led to doubts about the team's true potential, with pundits and fans alike expressing their concerns. John McGinn, a pivotal figure in Hibs' midfield since joining from St Mirren in 2015, remains unfazed by the criticism. The 26-year-old Scottish international has amassed over 150 appearances for the club and has even attracted interest from various English Premier League clubs. Although understanding the need for constructive feedback, McGinn believes that dismissing Hibernian's ability is a mistake. In a recent interview, he stated that he and his teammates intend to \\"end the season on a high\\" and prove their worth. \\"We know we've got a talented group of players, and we also understand that we've had some disappointing results. But that only serves as motivation for us to finish the season strong and show our true quality.\\" McGinn points out that Hibernian have shown their potential with victories over the likes of Celtic and Rangers, indicating that when the team is at its best, they can compete with the top clubs in the league. He remains optimistic that with the right mindset and hard work, Hibernian can find the consistency they need heading into the final stretch of the season. But McGinn's goals extend beyond domestic success. As a key player in the national team, his aspirations run parallel with the hopes of the Tartan Army. Scotland will participate in the postponed UEFA Euro 2020 this summer, their first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup. McGinn hopes that he can take his experience from Hibernian and use it as a catalyst for a successful tournament run with his compatriots. To achieve their objectives, both personal and collective, Hibs will need to rely not only on McGinn's abilities but also on the contributions of their other talented players. Forwards Kevin Nisbet and Martin Boyle have been instrumental in the team's attack, while goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and defender Paul Hanlon have played key roles in solidifying the backline. With a determined John McGinn leading by example, Hibernian have the chance to turn their season around and prove the doubters wrong. As the pressure mounts and the stakes get higher, McGinn and Hibs must come together to achieve their ambitions, both on and off the field. By marrying passion with poise and grit with grace, this spirited team can rise to the occasion and secure their place among Scottish football's elite. In the end, football is a game of ups and downs, with even the most acclaimed teams facing periods of inconsistency or time in the spotlight. For Hibernian, now is the time to rally behind their experienced midfielder and channel the criticism into the energy that drives them towards a triumphant conclusion to the season. Only then will John McGinn and his teammates truly make the critics eat their words."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mitzna and party secretary Ophir Pines agreed to convene party organizations within 10 days to discuss whether new primaries would be held or a temporary leader appointed .","output":"Although these two sentences convey somewhat similar information, there are subtle differences. In the first sentence, the focus is on Pines stating that he would \\"convene the relevant party bodies within 10 days.\\" The main subject of the sentence is Pines, and the point of the sentence is to state that he will gather the party bodies. Additionally, the sentence outlines two potential courses of action: holding new elections or appointing a temporary leader. The term \\"new elections\\" implies that the party may be updating its elected representatives, while the mention of \\"temporary leader\\" suggests that the leadership position would be a temporary solution until a permanent one is established. In contrast, the second sentence centers on the agreement between Mitzna and Pines. The sentence states that they agreed to \\"convene party organizations within 10 days.\\" The second sentence also outlines two possible outcomes, but with some variation: holding \\"new primaries\\" or appointing a \\"temporary leader.\\" The term \\"new primaries\\" specifically refers to the selection process through which a candidate is chosen for an election within the party, rather than the broader term \\"new elections\\" used in the first sentence. The second sentence also emphasizes cooperation between Mitzna and Pines, whereas the first sentence solely focuses on Pines' actions. In summary, while both sentences mention the convening of party entities within 10 days to discuss potential actions (holding elections/primaries or appointing a temporary leader), the first sentence highlights Pines' statement, whereas the second sentence focuses on the agreement between Mitzna and Pines.

The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.

The couple, who had no children of their own, looked after Salome for the first year of her life, giving her a cot in their bedroom. Thirteen years later, in 1990, Mr Smith bade an emotional farewell to the ape when he was made redundant at the age of 60. Two years later she was transferred from London Zoo to Bristol.

Later, when the gorilla was grown up, Ron had to say goodbye because he didn't work at the zoo anymore. Salome was moved from one zoo to another, but then one happy day, Ron went to visit her in her new home at Bristol Zoo.

One such dance is waltz .     There is a basic form for waltz, which you can see in this drawing of a dancing couple. The man places one arm around the woman's waist and she places her opposite hand on his shoulder. Then, they stretch their other arms out from their bodies and clasp hand. If someone tries to teach you a formal kind of dancing, chances are your teacher will start with the waltz. Have you ever tried to dance like this?      There are lots of different kinds of waltz, all performed to different types of waltz music.  The music might be fast or slow but what they all have is a regular one-two-three, one-two-three rhythm.   The traditional form is the old-school waltz in which dancers turn all the time with a hopping , springy step. This waltz has a slow, smooth, gliding step. There's also the Mexican waltz, which moves much faster. Listen to this Mexican waltz music and you can imagine how fast the dancers had to move.     Formal dancing has even become a profession, with people entering competitions. Have you ever seen a formal dance competition?     Today, ballroom dancing is almost considered a competitive sport; professionals perform different dances, each with strict rules.

Article: It is a novel that is probably more talked about than read. People think: \\"It's such a big book!

But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode   War and Peace miniseries   produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward   of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite   Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

Background: Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems.  Paragraph: A scientist is in the lab testing mixing water with different chemicals. While working with chemical A he notes that the water becomes colder after combining them. With chemical B the water becomes much warmer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the changes in temperature, does chemical A cause an exothermic process or an endothermic process? Answer:","output":"Given the changes in temperature, chemical A causes an endothermic process. This is because the temperature of the water decreases after mixing with chemical A, which indicates that energy has been absorbed in the process, consistent with an endothermic reaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now. However far-fetched they may seem, these comparisons reflect a frantic search among Western politicians and experts for the underlying causes, rationales and consequences of Russia's actions in Ukraine.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to design a habitat for a ladybird  Poke holes in an empty plastic box.  Choose a box that is a least 6 inches on each side, with a lid that seals.  You can find large plastic food storage containers at a thrift store or dollar store.","output":"Make sure to wash and dry the container thoroughly before creating the habitat, as cleanliness is crucial for the ladybirds' health and wellbeing. Next, place a layer of soil or peat moss, about an inch or two deep, at the bottom of the container to replicate the ladybirds' natural environment and provide a comfortable surface for them to move around on. It can be helpful to slightly dampen the soil or peat moss with water, as ladybirds prefer a slightly humid environment. Once the base layer is in place, gather small twigs, leaves, and other plant materials to create a micro-landscape within the habitat, ensuring that there are ample places for the ladybirds to hide, climb, and explore. Be sure to include plants that serve as suitable food sources for the ladybirds, such as aphid-infested plants or nectar-rich flowering varieties. Maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels is essential in designing an effective habitat for ladybirds. Ideally, keep the habitat in a location that receives indirect sunlight, as temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C) are best suited for ladybirds. Additionally, be mindful of maintaining the humidity within the habitat, as excessively dry environments can be detrimental to their health. Regularly misting the habitat with water can help achieve this. Fresh food must be supplied regularly, with a mix of aphids, pollen, and nectar to cater to their dietary needs. Also, provide a shallow water source, such as a bottle cap or small dish filled with water, but place small stones or marbles in it so the ladybirds can drink safely without the risk of drowning. Finally, be prepared to release any captive ladybirds back into the wild after they have completed their life cycle, as this is an essential aspect of maintaining healthy ladybird populations and promoting biodiversity. Always handle ladybirds gently and with care, ensuring their wings are not damaged during capture and release. In conclusion, designing a habitat for a ladybird requires consideration of several crucial factors, including a suitable enclosure, the appropriate environment, proper nutrition, and release back into the wild. By following these guidelines, you can create a safe and supportive habitat for ladybirds to thrive in and contribute positively to their populations and the environment around them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates announced their decision on a fund-raising website following Charlie's death. The couple had appealed for cash to pay for overseas medical treatment for their son. More than 84,000 people donated money to the cause. Charlie suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness. The parents of the 11-month-old, fought a lengthy legal battle with Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) to allow him to be taken to the US for treatment. But they dropped their action after Professor Michio Hirano, the American neurologist who had offered to treat him, said it was too late for the treatment to work. Charlie died on 28 July shortly before his first birthday. In a statement, his parents said: \\"In the following weeks we will be setting up The Charlie Gard Foundation - a foundation that will help other children with mitochondrial diseases, and rare childhood illnesses. \\"Too many children are losing their fight against rare medical conditions, which emphasises the need for more research, and we hope we can help deliver this through Charlie's foundation.\\" They also outlined plans for the charity to provide \\"information for parents that may find themselves in a situation like ours.\\" \\"There needs to be more clarity for parents about parental rights when it comes to making life-saving decisions about their children. \\"Access to medical treatment, and expert clinicians, should never be denied if funds are available.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"A room fire can be divided into various phases.  Throughout the development of a room fire, distinct phases can be identified as the fire evolves from ignition to a fully developed fire and finally either self-extinguishes or is suppressed. Each of these phases plays a crucial role in affecting the entire fire process, and understanding them can aid in fighting fires, minimizing damage, and ensuring the safety of occupants and firefighters. Here are the primary phases of a room fire: 1. Incipient Phase or Ignition: This is the initial phase when the fire is relatively small and localized. It begins with the ignition of the combustible materials present in the room due to a heat source, a chemical reaction, or electrical malfunction. During this phase, the fire produces a small amount of heat and smoke, and if detected and suppressed early, it can prevent the fire from growing and causing more extensive damages. 2. Growth Phase: The fire starts to grow rapidly during this phase due to increased heat production and the involvement of additional combustible materials. The thermal layering of hot gas and smoke begins to develop under the ceiling, gradually reducing the visibility in the room. As the room temperature increases, convection currents cause the fire to spread to other parts of the room, involving more materials and surfaces. 3. Flashover: This phase is a critical turning point in a room fire because it represents the moment when the majority of combustible materials within the room become involved simultaneously. The entire room, or most of it, becomes engulfed in fire, making it extremely dangerous for occupants and firefighters. This is due to a combination of factors, including high temperatures, high levels of radiant heat flux, and an increased concentration of combustible gases. The flashover phase is often accompanied by a rapid increase in fire intensity and a significant expansion of the fire's size. 4. Fully Developed Phase: In this phase, the fire has reached its maximum size and intensity, consuming all available oxygen and fuel within the room. The temperature within the room becomes very high, and structural components may begin to fail, posing a significant risk to those in the vicinity. In case of interconnected rooms or buildings, the fire may spread to adjoining areas, causing the development of additional fires or flashovers in those spaces. 5. Decay Phase: The fire begins to diminish during this phase. This could be due to the consumption of available fuel and oxygen, the interventions taken by firefighters, or a combination of both factors. As the fire starts to lose intensity, the room temperature starts to drop, and the flames begin to retreat. During this phase, the production of smoke and toxic gases starts to decrease. Understanding these various phases of a room fire is essential for implementing appropriate fire prevention and protection measures, predicting fire behavior, and training firefighters and other emergency personnel. Properly designed fire detection and suppression systems, along with solid building construction and fire-resistant materials, can help to slow down or stop the progression through these phases, thus allowing more time for occupants to escape and firefighters to suppress the fire effectively."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, GP32, Tapwave Zodiac, and the N-Gage. Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance. As of June 30, 2010, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide. Its successor, the Nintendo DS, was released in November 2004 and is also compatible with Game Boy Advance software.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - NASCAR Heat is a 2000 racing video game for the PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color. It was developed by Monster Games and published by Hasbro Interactive. The PlayStation version was co-developed with Digital Illusions CE.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers. Businesses as a form of economic activity are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services to customers in exchange for other goods, services, or money. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises charged by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Schalke 04 attacking midfielder Julian Draxler will be out for the rest of the year after picking up a thigh injury in their 1-0 win over Augsburg on Friday, the club said on Saturday. Germany's talented World Cup winner lasted only 11 seconds from the start of the Bundesliga game, pulling a thigh muscle, with sports director Horst Heldt saying it looked serious. 'He was again injured and it looks like a serious muscle injury,' Heldt said. 'I do not expect Julian to play any more in this first half of the season.' Julian draxler (centre) picked up the injury just 11 seconds into Schalke's 1-0 win over Augsburg. The 21-year-old (pictured) is likely to miss the rest of 2014 after picking up a thigh injury on Friday. The news will come as a massive blow to new manager Roberto Di Matteo as the young attacking midfielder is an influential member of the Schalke side. Draxler has been heavily linked with a move away from the Gelsenkirchen club in recent transfer windows with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a keen admirer of the Germany international's talents. The 21-year-old is set to miss their remaining three Champions League group games plus Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and friendly against Spain next month. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Julian Draxler, the attacking midfielder for Schalke 04, will be sidelined for the rest of the year due to a thigh injury he sustained during a recent 1-0 victory over Augsburg. This unfortunate incident took place just 11 seconds into the Bundesliga game, and Schalke's sports director, Horst Heldt, confirmed that the injury appeared to be severe. The 21-year-old midfielder is a valuable addition to their team, having played a notable role in Germany's World Cup win. His absence is a considerable blow to Schalke's new manager, Roberto Di Matteo, as Draxler serves as a crucial member to the team's success. The young talent's exemplary performance on the field has caught the attention of various European clubs, with Arsenal being among them. Their interest hasn't gone unnoticed, and Arsène Wenger, Arsenal's manager, has been vocal in expressing his admiration for Draxler's skills. Unfortunately, the timing of this injury is incredibly inconvenient for both Schalke and the German national team. As a result, Draxler will be forced to miss the remaining three Champions League group matches as well as Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and their friendly match with Spain next month. Though Draxler's injury poses challenges for both his club and national team, it provides an opportunity for other players to step up and demonstrate their capabilities.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Geo TV owners print front-page apology to Pakistan's ISI spy chief Hamid Mir, who survived an attack by gumen in Karachi, is surrounded by fellow journalists after his appearance before a judicial commission. Photograph: T Mughal/EPA Pakistan's embattled media group printed a grovelling front-page apology to the army on Monday after allegations broadcast by Geo TV that the country's spy chief had plotted to assassinate one of the channel's star journalists. The apology came two days before an anticipated ruling by the broadcast regulator on the affair and marked a clear retreat by a media conglomerate after weeks of bruising public criticism from the army, opposition politicians, extremist clerics and media rivals. The text, printed in English on the front page of the News and in Urdu in the bestselling Daily Jang, said its coverage of a gun attack in Karachi that seriously injured journalist Hamid Mir in April had been \\"excessive, distressful and emotional\\". After the shooting of Mir, Geo TV had responded by giving prominence in its hours of coverage to the allegations from Mir's brother that Zaheer-ul-Islam, the head of military spy agency the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI), had ordered the assassination attempt. The company said it deeply apologised to the ISI chief and his family. It also insisted that it has \\"the greatest regard and respect for the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership\\". Initially Geo had put up a vigorous defence of its actions but its position has progressively weakened as the weeks have gone by. At the behest of the army the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) was asked to consider banning Geo. Under military pressure many cable companies dropped or downgraded Geo, overturning the channels once dominant audience share. And other private channels have ripped into their main rival, accusing it of betraying the country. Clerics have also accused Geo of broadcasting blasphemous material in a light entertainment show – a move that potentially put the group's journalists at risk from violent retaliation. The furore has aggravated an increasingly acrimonious relationship between Pakistan's civilian government and the army, with many assuming Geo had received the backing of the ruling party to attack the ISI. Pemra is set make a decision on the army's complaint against Geo on Wednesday. Although Geo framed the row as merely one of the \\"ups and downs\\" of any other \\"relationship\\" and said it was time to move forward, many analysts believe the military establishment will not be satisfied with an apology alone.

But I can use this background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  What is an answer for this question: Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","output":"Based on the description of the two groups of antelope in sub-Saharan Africa and the background information on the theory of evolution by natural selection, it can be concluded that Group A, the antelopes with long necks and strong teeth, are more adapted to the environment. This conclusion is drawn based on several key factors outlined in the information provided: 1. Adaptation: As the theory of evolution by natural selection suggests, organisms with heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in their environment are more likely to be successful in passing on their genes to the next generation. In the case of the antelopes in sub-Saharan Africa, the long necks and strong teeth of Group A provide them with better access to food sources from tall trees, such as fruits and leaves. This increased accessibility to resources is a clear advantage for their survival in this particular environment. 2. Environmental conditions: The sub-Saharan Africa region, where these antelopes are found, consists of tall trees, which serve as primary food sources for the herbivorous animals living there. As Group A has an easier time reaching these food sources with their long necks and strong teeth, they are better suited to thrive in this environment compared to Group B, which possesses shorter necks and weaker teeth and would, therefore, face more difficulty in accessing food from tall trees. 3. Fitness and reproductive success: The theory of natural selection emphasizes the importance of \\"fitness\\" in determining the survival and reproductive success of organisms in a particular environment. Since Group A antelopes are better adapted to the sub-Saharan environment due to their advantageous traits, they are more likely to have greater reproductive success than their Group B counterparts. Over time, this would result in the genes associated with long necks and strong teeth becoming more common in the antelope population. In conclusion, the antelopes from Group A in sub-Saharan Africa are more adapted to their environment due to the combination of their advantageous traits, specifically their long necks and strong teeth, which enable them to access food resources more readily than the antelopes from Group B. This increased adaptation, combined with the principles of natural selection, suggests that over time, the prevalence of these advantageous traits will likely increase in the antelope population within this region, due to the greater fitness and reproductive success exhibited by Group A."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Note: This is a remake of the 2010 Spanish-language low-budget Uruguayan horror film 'La Casa Muda'. Both the original and this remake were (allegedly) shot in one take with no actual cuts or edits with a single camera, similar to the 1948 experimental film 'Rope' by Alfred Hitchcock.We begin with an overhead shot of a young woman, Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) sitting on some rocks in a lake. As she gets off and begins to hop among the rocks back to the shore, the camera descends and begins following Sarah in real-time. She walks up to an obviously dilapidated house. The house is three stories tall and has red-brick exteriors with all of the windows boarded up. Sarah's father John (Adam Trese) meets her near the front steps and tells her sternly to pick up the gardening tools lying about. John then asks Sarah about her Facebook profile, and she admits that her ex-boyfriend may want to get back together with her, much to John's disapproval.John's younger brother and Sarah's Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens) walks through the front door and greets the two of them. He says that there is a big problem in the house. They walk in, and though it is daylight outside, the house is almost pitch black as all the windows are boarded. The trio turn on their electric lanterns and follow Peter to the dining room (the source of the problem) where John hits the wall with a sledgehammer to reveal that mold has grown within the walls, and maybe throughout the entire house. Tools and clutter are strewn everywhere. They take a picture of the mold with their polaroid camera and after her father walks out of the room Peter stares at Sarah, telling her how beautiful of a woman she has become. After they enter the living room, John and Peter then leave to go into another part of the house, and Sarah starts up the stairs when she hears a knock at the front door.She opens the door to see a girl roughly her age standing on the porch.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Dunham was born in Dallas, Texas on April 18, 1962. When he was three months old, he was adopted by real estate appraiser Howard Dunham, and his homemaker wife Joyce, who raised him in a devoutly Presbyterian household in an affluent Dallas neighborhood, as an only child. He began ventriloquism in 1970 at age eight, when his parents gave him a Mortimer Snerd dummy for Christmas, and an accompanying how-to album. The next day he checked out a how-to book on ventriloquism from the library, and explained in 2011 that he still had it, remarking that he was \\"a thief in the third grade\\". On July 18, 2003, Dunham appeared on Comedy Central Presents, his first solo appearance on Comedy Central. During his half hour piece, he showcased Jose Jalapeno on a Stick, Walter, an early version of Melvin the Superhero Guy and Peanut, whom Dunham had begun to merchandise into a line of dolls. The appearance was successful, but Comedy Central resisted giving Dunham more airtime, feeling that he was not a good fit for them. By 2005 Dunham decided to gamble on financing his own comedy DVD, Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, which was taped in Santa Ana, California. Dunham's manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, lobbied the network to air it, pointing to Dunham's drawing power and merchandising profits, and arguing that the network needed more diverse content. Surprised by the high ratings of the first Blue Collar Comics concert movie that same year, the network began to reconsider its brand. In late 2006, Comedy Central aired Arguing with Myself, drawing two million viewers when it aired, and selling two million DVDs.  In 2007, Dunham appeared as The Amazing Ken with Jose Jalapeno on a Stick in the Larry the Cable Guy feature film Delta Farce. His second special, Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity, was taped at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. that same year. It served not only to cement Dunham's stardom, but to introduce his most controversial character, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, which became a viral Internet sensation. A clip of Achmed from Insanity attracted over 140 million hits on YouTube, making it the ninth most watched clip on that website as of October 2009.  By 2008, Dunham's characters had crossed language barriers, with his specials dubbed for audiences in various countries such as France, and Dunham attracting requests for performances in South Africa, Australia, Norway, Denmark, China, and the Middle East. Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special was taped at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that same year, and premiered on Comedy Central on November 16, 2008, watched by 6.6 million people. It became available on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008. The special's premiere was the highest rated telecast in Comedy Central's history.  In September 2008, his career reached new heights as he began performing in arenas filled with tens of thousands of people. Dunham was somewhat wary of such large venues, but adapted by adjusting the timing of his often rapid exchanges with the puppets so that audience members farthest from the stage could have time to react.  In addition to his comedy specials, Dunham also released his first music album, Don't Come Home for Christmas, on November 4, 2008. It contains original Christmas songs as well as a parody of \\"Jingle Bells\\" by Achmed entitled \\"Jingle Bombs\\". All the songs, with the exception of \\"Jingle Bombs\\", were written and accompanied by Brian Haner, who joined Dunham's act as \\"Guitar Guy\\".

Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant. Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors. Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood. Gerry was from an early time a vocal opponent of Parliamentary efforts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods. He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including Samuel Adams, John Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, and others.  In May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (its legislative assembly). There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies. He was responsible for establishing Marblehead's committee of correspondence, one of the first to be set up after that of Boston. However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year. Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had established a hospital for performing smallpox inoculations on Cat Island; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors' other properties.  Gerry reentered politics after the Boston Port Act closed that city's port in 1774, and Marblehead became a port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered. As one of the town's leading merchants and Patriots, Gerry played a major role in ensuring the storage and delivery of supplies from Marblehead to Boston, interrupting those activities only to care for his dying father. He was elected as a representative to the First Continental Congress in September 1774, but refused, still grieving the loss of his father.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.  I am facing a new situation today: In the year 1630 during the month of January Captain Cook began his voyage from the port of Calais in Europe, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. His intention was  to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical  land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June,  1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which place received less direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia? A:","output":"When Captain Cook began his voyage in January 1630, Europe, located in the Northern Hemisphere, was receiving less direct sunlight compared to Australia, which is located in the Southern Hemisphere.  As mentioned in the background article, during November, December, and January, the Southern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. These months are considered the warmest in the Southern Hemisphere due to the increased solar flux caused by Earth's axial tilt. Therefore, in January 1630, Australia would have been in the midst of its warmest season, experiencing increased exposure to direct sunlight. On the other hand, the Northern Hemisphere, where Europe is located, experiences increased direct sunlight in the months of May, June, and July. Since Captain Cook's voyage began in January, Europe was in the colder part of the year, when the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight. The axial tilt of the Earth during this period would have placed Europe further away from the Sun, resulting in reduced solar flux and cooler temperatures. In conclusion, based on the background information and understanding of Earth's axial tilt and seasonal changes, Europe received less direct sunlight than Australia when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Quidditch is a fictional sport invented by author J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series. It is a popular and highly competitive sport in the wizarding world, played by witches and wizards on flying broomsticks. The game consists of two teams, each with seven players: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The objective of the game is to score points by getting the Quaffle, a ball, through one of the three opposing team's hoops, while the opposing team's Keeper tries to block the shots. Chasers are responsible for passing the Quaffle and scoring goals. Meanwhile, Beaters use bats to hit Bludgers, which are two enchanted balls that fly around the field trying to knock players off their brooms. The Beaters' role is to protect their teammates from the Bludgers and attempt to direct them towards the opposing team. The most important ball in the game is the Golden Snitch, a small winged ball that the Seeker on each team tries to catch. Catching the Snitch is worth 150 points and ends the game. The team whose Seeker catches the Snitch usually wins the game, but there are instances where a team can still lose even after catching the Snitch if the opposing team has a higher score. Quidditch is played extensively throughout the Harry Potter series and is a significant part of the students' life at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with inter-house competitions and international events like the Quidditch World Cup."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In pea plants, tall is dominant over short. What size pea plants will result when a pure tall plant is crossed with a pure short plant?","output":"When examining the inheritance of traits in pea plants, Gregor Mendel's principles of genetics can be applied to explain how the offspring will inherit the specific trait. In this case, we are looking at the height of pea plants – where the allele for tall (T) is dominant over the allele for short (t). To understand the resulting size of pea plants when a pure tall plant is crossed with a pure short plant, we first need to know the genotypes of both parental plants. A pure tall plant will have the genotype TT, meaning it possesses two dominant alleles for the trait of height. A pure short plant, on the other hand, will have the genotype tt, carrying two recessive alleles for the height trait. When the tall plant (TT) is crossed with the short plant (tt), the offspring's genotype and phenotype can be predicted using a basic genetic tool called a Punnett Square. T | t ----- T | t The Punnett Square is divided into four sections, representing each possible combination of alleles that the offspring can inherit. Based on this simple cross, we have the following combinations: 1. Tt – Tall (from the first row and first column) 2. Tt – Tall (from the first row and second column) 3. Tt – Tall (from the second row and first column) 4. Tt – Tall (from the second row and second column) As a result, all four possible offspring will have the genotype Tt and will exhibit the tall phenotype. This is because the dominant allele (T) is expressed in their genotype, masking the effects of the recessive allele (t). These offspring are considered heterozygous for the height trait, as they possess one dominant allele and one recessive allele. In conclusion, when crossing a pure tall pea plant (TT) with a pure short pea plant (tt), all offspring will exhibit the tall phenotype due to the presence of the dominant allele (T) in their genotype (Tt)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Huddie William Ledbetter  (January 20, 1888 - December 6, 1949) was an American folk and blues musician notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced. He is best known as Lead Belly. Though many releases credit him as \\"Leadbelly\\", he himself wrote it as \\"Lead Belly\\", which is also the spelling on his tombstone and the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation. Context: Lead Belly was born Huddie William Ledbetter on the Jeter Plantation near Mooringsport, Louisiana, on January 20, 1888 or 1889 (generally accepted to be the former). The 1900 United States Census lists \\"Hudy Ledbetter\\" as 12 years old, born January 1888, and the 1910 and 1930 censuses also give his age as corresponding to a birth in 1888. The 1940 census lists his age as 51, with information supplied by wife Martha. However, in April 1942, when Ledbetter filled out his World War II draft registration, he gave his birth date as January 23, 1889, and his birthplace as Freeport, Louisiana (\\"Shreveport\\"). His grave marker bears the date given on his draft registration.  Ledbetter was the younger of two children born to Wesley Ledbetter and Sallie Brown. The pronunciation of his name is purported to be \\"HYEW-dee\\" or \\"HUGH-dee.\\" He can be heard pronouncing his name as \\"HUH-dee\\" on the track \\"Boll Weevil,\\" from the Smithsonian Folkways album Lead Belly Sings for Children. His parents had cohabited for several years, but they legally married on February 26, 1888. When Huddie was five years old, the family settled in Bowie County, Texas.  The 1910 census of Harrison County, Texas, shows \\"Hudy\\" Ledbetter living next door to his parents with his first wife, Aletha \\"Lethe\\" Henderson. Aletha is registered as age 19 and married one year. Others say she was 15 when they married in 1908. It was in Texas that Ledbetter received his first instrument, an accordion, from his uncle Terrell. By his early twenties, having fathered at least two children, Ledbetter left home to make his living as a guitarist and occasional laborer. When Lead Belly was released from his last prison sentence, the United States was deep in the Great Depression, and jobs were very scarce. In September 1934, in need of regular work in order to avoid cancellation of his release from prison, Lead Belly asked John Lomax to take him on as a driver. For three months, he assisted the 67-year-old in his folk song collecting around the South (Alan Lomax was ill and did not accompany his father on this trip). Question: What kind of music style did he play?. Whats the answer?","output":"Lead Belly played a music style called folk and blues. His songs had strong singing and he was really good at playing a twelve-string guitar. He also taught people new folk songs that became very popular. So, the answer is: Lead Belly played folk and blues music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that is attending a local band concert with his mother?, using the article: In early 1900s Cincinnati, young and beautiful Ray Schmidt works in her father's shop by day and stays out late drinking beer and dancing with various men by night, although her stepmother disapproves. Ray dates for fun, mostly going out with traveling salesmen passing through town, and neither she nor her dates are interested in any permanent attachment. An exception is Kurt Shendler, who owns a bicycle shop near Mr. Schmidt's shop and aspires to get into the automobile business. Kurt is in love with Ray and asks her to marry him, but she refuses because while she likes Kurt, she doesn't return his romantic feelings. While visiting the train station with Kurt, Ray meets Walter Saxel and the two fall for each other at first sight. Walter soon confesses to Ray that he is actually engaged to another woman in town, Corinne, who comes from a wealthy background and whose mother is friends with his own mother. Nevertheless he has fallen in love with Ray, and asks her to meet him at a local band concert that he will be attending with his mother. Walter hopes to introduce Ray to his mother and perhaps get her approval of the relationship. On the day of the concert, Ray is late arriving because her younger half-sister Freda is suicidal over her boyfriend, Hugo, leaving town. Freda begs Ray to go after Hugo and stop him, threatening to throw herself out a window if Ray does not help. By the time Ray has dealt with Freda's situation and gotten to the concert, it is over, and Ray cannot find Walter or his mother in the departing crowds.

Fact 2: Day and night temperatures varied widely.  Given the two facts above, a planet rotating causes?","output":"Given the two facts:  1. A planet rotating causes cycles of day and night on that planet  2. Day and night temperatures vary widely  From these facts, we can infer that a planet's rotation causes changes in temperature on its surface. Here's why: Earth's rotation provides an example. As it rotates on its axis (an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles), the planet experiences periods of daylight and darkness--days and nights. This cycle is due to one portion of the planet facing the Sun (daytime) while the other half is turned away from the Sun (nighttime).  During the daylight hours, the portion of Earth exposed to the Sun receives sunlight and therefore heats up. This causes that part of the Earth to experience generally warmer temperatures, often translated into \\"daytime\\" temperatures. During the nighttime hours, the portion of Earth turned away from the Sun is not receiving sunlight. Consequently, it cools down because no new heat is being received, and the heat that was accumulated during the day is gradually being lost to space. This results in cooler temperatures, often referred to as \\"nighttime\\" temperatures. On any planet, not just Earth, this rotation and subsequent exposure or lack of exposure to a heat source like a star, would cause significant variations in temperature between the day and night sides of the planet. Therefore, a rotating planet's cyclical exposure to its star (like the Sun for Earth) would cause variations in temperature—typically warmer temperatures during its day when the planet is exposed to its star, and colder temperatures during its night when the planet is not exposed to its star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Trying to end a two-game losing streak, the Giants went into Lincoln Financial Field for a crucial Week 8 game with the Philadelphia Eagles, as the divisional lead was up for grabs. New York trailed greatly in the first quarter as Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb's 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. Philadelphia would begin the third quarter with an increase to their lead as Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal. New York tried to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes booted a 35-yard field goal, followed by running back Ahmad Bradshaw. However, the Eagles would seal the win in the fourth quarter as running back LeSean McCoy got a 66-yard touchdown run. How many yards difference was Donovan McNabb's touchdown pass to Brent Celek compared to his touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson?","output":"Imagine a football field where the players are trying to score points by moving the ball to the other side. The Giants and the Eagles were two teams playing a game. Donovan McNabb is the leader of the Eagles, and he threw the ball two times to his friends, Brent Celek and DeSean Jackson, to help them score.  When he threw the ball to Brent Celek, they gained 17 yards, like taking 17 big steps on the field. Later, when he threw the ball to DeSean Jackson, they gained 54 yards, which is like taking 54 big steps. Now, to find the difference between these two throws, you can think of it as counting the steps between 17 and 54.  You can do this by subtracting the smaller number (17) from the bigger number (54): 54 - 17. If you count on your fingers, or use toys or crayons to help you count, you will find that the difference is 37 yards. So Donovan McNabb's touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson went 37 yards more than his pass to Brent Celek."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the below context:  Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the turbine spins less quickly happens, how will it affect LESS salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let us first break it down step-by-step and justify the effect of a slower spinning turbine on the salt removal process. 1. Water is heated: The heating of water is crucial for the evaporation process. A slower spinning turbine would not directly affect this step, as the heat source is typically separate from the turbine. 2. The heated water evaporates: The evaporation process depends on the temperature and surface area of the water, not the speed of the turbine. Therefore, a slower spinning turbine would not have a direct impact on this step. 3. The salt is left behind: As the water evaporates, the dissolved salt remains in the original container. This step is not dependent on the turbine speed, so a slower spinning turbine would not directly affect the amount of salt left behind. 4. The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface: The rate of condensation may be slightly affected by the air flow produced by the spinning turbine. If the turbine spins less quickly, it may result in reduced air circulation, which could potentially slow down the condensation process. However, this effect would be minimal and not significantly impact the overall salt removal process. 5. The evaporated water is collected: The slower spinning turbine may have an indirect effect on collecting evaporated water, as it could slightly extend the time needed for condensation. However, this impact would not change the efficiency of salt removal dramatically. 6. The process is repeated: As long as the heating, evaporation, and condensation processes continue to function effectively, the slower spinning turbine would not have a significant impact on the overall process. 7. More salt is removed from the water: The ultimate result of the process – the removal of salt from the water – is chiefly determined by the efficiency of the heating, evaporation, and condensation steps. Although a slower spinning turbine could slightly impact the condensation process, this effect is likely to be minimal and not substantially alter the overall salt removal efficiency. In summary, while a slower spinning turbine might have a minimal indirect effect on the condensation process, it is unlikely to significantly affect how much salt is removed from the water. The primary steps responsible for salt removal - heating, evaporation, and condensation - are largely independent of turbine speed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species.  Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo.  To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready.

Sperling states that this is because \\"Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus\\" and also that \\"China's intervening Ming dynasty ... had no control over Tibet.\\" He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \\"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.Josef Kolmaš, a sinologist, Tibetologist, and Professor of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, writes that it was during the Qing dynasty \\"that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government.\\" Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.P.

(Reuters) Jillian Michaels, the fitness trainer and former host of NBC’s “The Biggest Loser” reality show, has accused Lionsgate of failing to compensate her for videos the studio posted to its YouTube fitness channel — to the tune of 10 million. A Lionsgate spokesman declined to comment. “Despite receiving millions of dollars in revenue from YouTube, and half of all views on the YouTube BeFit channel relation to Ms. Michaels’ Lions Gate (videos), Ms. Michaels has not received any compensation whatsover,” the complaint said. Michaels is alleging Lionsgate is in breach of her 2007 deal with the studio, under which she is entitled to a certain percentage of home-video gross revenue. YouTube paid Lionsgate 5 million to create BeFit, according to the complaint, and also pays a share of ad revenue generated by the channel. Lionsgate’s BeFit, launched in 2012, has generated more than 200 million views to date and has more than 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube. According to Michaels, Lionsgate did not consult her before they used her image and brand on the channel, and exceeded the number of videos posted to YouTube allowable under her contract.

The premise highlights the absence of laws to address the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand that could impact the pricing of medical goods and services. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that medical prices will increase to a specific price point (1000 per pill) as a direct result of Congress's actions. It is important to note that the actual increase in prices is likely to be influenced by multiple factors, including operational costs, market competition, and price negotiation by insurance providers and pharmacies. Therefore, attributing the price increase to a single cause, like the absence of conforming amendments in legislation, may be an oversimplification of the issue. Moreover, it would be difficult to predict the exact change in medical prices without detailed information and analysis of various market forces and trends. Additionally, numerous factors, such as the type of medication, existing patents, and industry trends, could lead to different price points for different medications. The premise does not provide enough evidence or context to fully support the hypothesis provided.

What is the answer?","output":"The ream is a common retail unit of paper. Consisting of 20 quires of 25 sheets each, a ream contains a total of 500 sheets of paper. This standard measure of paper quantity is widely used across different industries and settings, including offices, schools, and businesses that utilize paper for various purposes, such as printing, writing, photocopying, and crafting. Paper is a versatile and essential item, made primarily from cellulose pulp derived from wood, grasses, or rags. The process of creating paper typically involves breaking down natural fibers, mixing them with water to create a slurry, and then spreading the mixture onto a flat surface to drain the water and form an even layer of interwoven fibers. Once dried, this sheet of fibers becomes a durable and user-friendly material – paper.  Reams play a crucial role in paper-related transactions, as they provide a standardized way of quantifying large amounts of paper, ensuring accurate pricing and reducing the potential for confusion or errors. The size of the sheets in a ream can vary depending on the intended use or personal preferences. For instance, widely-used paper sizes in reams include A4, Letter, and Legal sizes. Apart from the standard 500-sheet ream, other variations of ream sizes exist for certain situations. A short ream contains 480 sheets, while a long ream is composed of 516 sheets of paper. These alternative sizes are less common and predominantly used for specialized purposes. In conclusion, a ream is a common retail unit of paper, typically containing 20 quires of 25 sheets each, for a total of 500 sheets. This standardized measure of paper quantity is employed worldwide, serving to streamline paper transactions and organize paper products systematically.

As she pondered the question, she took another bite of the heavenly grilled-cheese sandwich. The sensation of the cheese melting in her mouth and the tanginess of the tomato soup reminded her of simpler times and the comfort of home-cooked meals. Her mind wandered, and she found herself reminiscing about the surprisingly wonderful moments she'd already shared with Jason. Indeed, her journey to San Francisco had so far been a rollercoaster ride of emotions and unexpected twists. She had come to the city, hoping to find new experiences, and maybe even reinvent herself a little. But at the core of her adventure, what she was truly seeking, was a connection – something that would breathe life into her stagnant existence. From the start, Jason had been an enigma, a wild card in her carefully planned escapade. He was charming, witty, and had an air of mystery about him that was both thrilling and unnerving – precisely the kind of person she would have usually steered clear of. However, there was something about his presence that drew her in, making it nearly impossible to resist the allure of the unknown. Their time together was filled with memorable moments – from spontaneous midnight picnics under the stars to indulging in decadent Godiva s'mores that would leave them laughing and chocolate-stained. It was like being in a dream – a dream that she never wanted to wake up from. But that's exactly what she feared – that once the spell broke, reality would come crashing down, and she would be left with nothing but a bittersweet memory of their brief encounter. Still, her heart skipped a beat as she thought about the possibility of a passionate affair with Jason – the excitement, the intense emotions, and the overwhelming sense of connection that only two people who have fallen deeply for each other could experience. If she were to risk her heart, it could mean the start of something extraordinary; a love story that would span beyond the borders of time and space. But, alongside the anticipation of such a profound connection, she couldn't shake the nagging doubts that lingered in the back of her mind. What if this affair turned out to be nothing more than a fleeting moment in time? What if her heart suffered a terrible blow, and she was left worse off than when she'd first arrived in San Francisco? She feared trusting Jason too much, only for him to disappoint her – or even worse, to break her heart. With a deep sigh, she took another dip of her grilled-cheese triangle into the tomato soup, cherishing the warmth that spread through her body as she slowly savored each bite. She knew that she would need to make a decision, one that could change the course of her life – either by taking the plunge and risking a passionate but uncertain romance with Jason or settling for the safety of her well-structured, predictable world. The clock on the wall ticked away as she weighed the pros and cons, her heart and mind battling fiercely in their attempt to decide what the best course of action would be. But deep down inside, something stirred – a feeling that whispered, nudging her towards the cusp of unprecedented bliss. It spoke of love, courage, and the notion of embracing the unexpected surprises that life held in store. As she finished the last remnants of her comforting meal, she knew what she needed to do. It was time to step into the uncharted territory of her own heart and be prepared for the wild ride that awaited her. In the end, she would embrace the unknown – for she knew that even the most terrifying risks were worth taking when it came to the tantalizing prospect of true love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Neil Hudson won what premier motocross championship in 1981? A:","output":"Neil Hudson won the 1981 250cc Motocross World Championship, which is a premier motocross championship governed by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). A British motorcycle racer born in 1957, Neil Hudson began his motocross career in the mid-1970s, initially riding for the Maico factory team. He went on to ride for a number of teams throughout his career, including Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. Hudson experienced great success during his motocross career, consistently finishing high in the rankings and representing his home nation in international competitions. In 1980, Hudson finished second in the 250cc World Championship, setting the stage for the following season. In 1981, he switched from riding Kawasaki to riding Yamaha. That same year, he achieved his career-defining accomplishment by winning the 250cc Motocross World Championship while riding for the Yamaha factory team. This victory made Hudson the first British rider to win the prestigious title in that class. Throughout the 1981 season, Hudson demonstrated exceptional skill and determination, consistently finishing at or near the top in numerous races. As the championship progressed, Hudson managed to secure enough points to stay ahead of other top racers, such as Georges Jobé and Hakan Carlqvist. Ultimately, Hudson's performances throughout the season -- and his consistent accumulation of points -- led him to secure the 1981 250cc Motocross World Championship. Neil Hudson continued to compete in motocross at a high level for several years after his 1981 triumph, earning a reputation for being a fierce competitor and passionate racer, but he couldn't replicate the same level of success that year. After retiring from professional racing, he continued to be involved with the sport, sharing his vast experience and knowledge with the next generation through coaching and mentoring. In the motocross world, Neil Hudson is still remembered for his groundbreaking achievement in securing the first 250cc World Championship for the United Kingdom in 1981."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to choose an under the sink water filter  Make sure you have room under your sink for a filter.  The filter will attach to the pipes beneath the sink, so clear enough space to accommodate the filter system.  Understand your water composition.","output":"Knowing what is in your water is crucial because different filter types deal with different contaminants. If your water comes from a municipal system, it's likely treated for most common harmful substances, but it might still contain certain contaminants like chlorine, lead, pharmaceuticals, or other pollutants. Conversely, if you source your water from a well, you will likely need a filter that can handle heavy metals, bacteria, chemicals, or specific substances that are commonly found in groundwater. You can identify what contaminants are present in your water by requesting a water quality report from your local water provider or by using a home water testing kit. These tests can inform you about the presence of various contaminants, including heavy metals, chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), pesticides, and bacteria. Based on your water composition, decide what type of water filter you need. There are many types available, including activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis filters, UV filters, and ceramic filters, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Activated carbon filters are excellent at removing chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds. Meanwhile, reverse osmosis filters can handle a broader range of substances, including dissolved salts, fluoride, and bacteria. UV filters are effective against microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, and ceramic filters are good at straining out sediments and bacteria, albeit they do not effectively remove chemical contaminants. Contemplate your water usage. Water filters have different capacities, which means they can only filter a certain amount of water before needing a replacement. So, consider your household's water consumption habits and select an under-sink water filter that can handle that volume. Also, different filters have different flow rates. If you want a filter that won't slow down your water, check the gallons per minute (GPM) on the filter. Pay close attention to the filter's maintenance and operating costs. Maintenance could include changing the cartridge of the filter, which varies from model to model. This upkeep can add to the overall cost of the filter system over time, so be sure to factor this into your budget. Additionally, some systems, particularly reverse osmosis and UV filters, require electricity to operate, adding more to operational costs. Finally, consider the installation process. Some under-sink water filters are relatively simple to install on your own with basic tools and instructions, while others may require professional installation. If you're not confident in installing the filter yourself, check whether the manufacturer offers professional installation or ask your plumber for assistance. Remember, a water filter is an investment in your health and the taste of your water. Make sure the one you choose can effectively handle all the potential issues within your specific water source. After all, clean, safe drinking water is essential for a healthy life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Beyond his business acumen, Wilson was known for his humble lifestyle that contradicted his millionaire status. His friends fondly reminisced over how the openly gay magnate often chose public transportation over luxury transport options. Despite his wealth, Wilson was a typical sight on the subway and it wasn't unusual for him to share cabs across the city.  However, his humbleness didn't just stop at his lifestyle choices. Wilson was also keen on philanthropy, and he had been strategically giving away his wealth for several years to causes close to his heart. Environmental and educational causes were at the top of his giving list. By establishing such a legacy, his memory will continue to have a positive impact, long after his untimely demise. Even in his death, Wilson’s life serves as a poignant reminder of the significance of giving back to society regardless of our personal circumstances. His extraordinary example of charity, humility, and authenticity challenges us all to question how we might contribute to the world beyond our existence. Obviously, the loss of a remarkable man like Robert Wilson leaves a significant void. But it's important for those struggling with similar painful circumstances to reach out and find professional support.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam captained Pakistan in thirty Tests, winning eleven, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win-loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. Although the Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place and had it not occurred, Inzamam's record would have had a win more and a loss less. However, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992, when Imran Khan retired.  Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland.  In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick's Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him 'The Bob'.

A sensible protocol for the use of such transfer flow control signals must be used , however , to avoid potential blocking conditions . A potential protocol for the use of sensitive flow control signals must be used , however , to avoid such deadlock conditions .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia might seem quite similar and address the use of protocols to avoid specific issues, they do not have exactly the same meaning. Let's break down and compare the essential components of both sentences to understand the differences clearly: 1. Sentence 1: \\"A sensible protocol for the use of such transfer flow control signals must be used, however, to avoid potential blocking conditions.\\" - The term \\"sensible\\" refers to something that is practical, reasonable, or has sound judgment. - \\"Such transfer flow control signals\\" implies that this sentence is referring to specific, previously mentioned types of flow control signals in the context. - \\"Potential blocking conditions\\" indicate the situation that might arise due to those flow control signals, causing processes to be blocked or prevented from executing tasks. 2. Sentence 2: \\"A potential protocol for the use of sensitive flow control signals must be used, however, to avoid such deadlock conditions.\\" - In this sentence, \\"potential\\" refers to something that has the possibility or the capability of occurring. Here, it's talking about a protocol that is not yet firmly established but can be useful in handling sensitive flow control signals. - \\"Sensitive flow control signals\\" suggest that these signals may be easily influenced or affected by external factors (like noise or interference), and they require extra care when being processed and managed. - \\"Such deadlock conditions\\" imply that this sentence is referring to specific, previously mentioned types of deadlock conditions that need to be avoided. In summary, the first sentence is talking about using a practical and sound-judgment-based protocol for managing particular transfer flow control signals to prevent potential blocking situations. On the other hand, the second sentence discusses the implementation of a potentially useful protocol to handle delicate or easily influenced flow control signals and preclude specific kinds of deadlock conditions. While both sentences discuss the need for protocols to manage flow control signals and avoid adverse situations, they differ in terms of the type of protocol, the nature of the flow control signals, and the specific undesirable outcomes being discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: What was the weather like?

So my boyfriend and I are living in a major city, about a thousand miles away from where we are both from. We dated back in the day for around 8 months when we both lived in our hometowns and parted ways when our lives weren't going in the same direction. Coincidentally, we both moved to the same city a couple years later and we reconnected and now have been dating here for about a year and a half. We've been doing pretty well and we just moved in together, having signed a preliminary 6 month lease. I thought things were going great, he is in graduate school and is working a really awesome job on the side that is exactly what he wants to do, and I'm working full-time and just completed my application for grad school. He's been going through a really hard time recently, as his grandpa who raised him recently just passed two weeks ago. He spent around two weeks in his hometown surrounded by his family and friends before the passing and after, and I joined him for various parts of the process. He's been back for three days now and he just seems really down, which is understandable. However, today he dropped the bomb on me that he wants to be out of the city by June and wants to move back home to be with his family and friends because he says he's miserable here and he hates the city that we live in. He has never given me any indication that he hates this place, in fact all he does is rave about his job and I thought he really liked it here. He says he hates the people here, that he doesn't feel appreciated in his job, and that he has no friends and really wants to be around people that support him. So essentially, in my mind, he's willing to give up an awesome job and quit grad school to move back to a place that he used to complain about non-stop. I feel I should also mention that he does have mild clinical depression and he used to be treated, but is no longer on medication. The thing that makes me the most angry is that he says he's been feeling this way since last November, way before I had officially decided whether or not I wanted to go back to grad school, and he knew this. I don't understand why he didn't tell me that he was feeling this way because had he, I might be more open to the idea of moving back home, but as it stands with my commitments, I don't want to go.

I have a new situation: Two brothers have a piece of land each, situated 2 miles from each other. Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it.  But I can use this background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  What is an answer for this question: Which of the two pieces of land is more fertile? A:","output":"Bob's land is more fertile."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Use a sod cutter to remove the marked turf. Slice the turf into strips along each baseline,  creating a bare path of earth that is 3 feet wide. Roll the strips up and remove them from the area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Use a mix that’s 50-75% sand and 25-50% clay and silt. A mix that’s too sandy will be unstable underfoot, while a mix with too much clay and silt will be too hard and compact. For each base, dig a 2’ x 2’ hole, 8.5” deep, where the base will be. Level the bottom and then set your anchor inside. Before burying the anchor, attach the base to the anchor's post. Double-check the anchor's placement by remeasuring the base’s distance from the back tip of home plate. Reposition the anchor if necessary. Then fill the hole back in with soil.  Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the base will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more. Remember that for second base, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the center of second base. For first and third bases, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the foul-side corner of each base. The top of your anchor post should be roughly a half-inch below the top of your hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the top of the post to double-check the distance before burying the anchor. Remove the marked turf within your pitcher’s mound. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. For adults, build your mound until the center rises 10 1/2 inches higher than home plate. For Little League, make your mound 6 inches at its highest. Then create the “slope” in front of the pitcher’s rubber by removing 1 inch of soil from the mound for every foot in front of the rubber, starting one foot out, until the soil reaches ground level at the edge of the mound. For the pitcher’s mound, use a mix that’s 40% sand, 20% silt, and 40% clay. Dig a 10” x 23” hole, 9.5” deep, where the rubber will be, with the longer side parallel to the front of home plate. Level the bottom, place the anchor inside, and stake it into position. Press soil along the base of each tube in the anchor to prevent concrete from leaking inside. Then fill the area surrounding the anchor with concrete without covering the anchor itself. Once the concrete has dried, withdraw the stakes and plug the anchor’s tubes. Refill the hole with soil. Then unplug the tubes and attach the rubber.  When you first place the anchor into the hole, attach the rubber. Double-check the anchor’s placement by measuring the distance between each of the rubber’s front corners with those of home plate to make sure they’re equidistant. Then gently remove the rubber without moving the anchor out of position. Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the rubber will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more. The top of each tube should be 1.5” below the top of the hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the tubes’ tops to double-check the distance before pouring concrete. Remove the marked turf within your batter’s area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Then outline your batter’s and catcher’s boxes with chalk.  Batter’s boxes (for both left-handed and right-handed players) are 4 feet wide and 6 feet long for adults, while those in Little League are 3 feet wide and 6 feet long. Measure the boxes so their midpoints are even with that of home plate. Allow six inches of free space between each box and home plate.  The catcher’s box is 43 inches wide and 8 feet long for adults, and 25 inches wide and 8 feet long for Little League. Measure your box so that it’s center is even with that of home plate. For each, begin your measurement from the back corner of home plate. From there, measure a distance of 325 feet along the outside of the square created by the baselines. At that distance, plant a pole marker. Then stretch a lining cord between the back corner of home plate and the pole marker. Chalk directly over the lining cord to create your foul line. Also an install a protective fence that extends 400 feet from home plate behind each foul line to shield spectators. Protect spectators behind the batter’s area from missed pitches and stray balls. Install a backstop 60 feet behind home plate for adult players; for Little League, install it 25 feet behind home plate.  Failing that, plant hedges instead to catch stray balls. Standard-sized backstops stand 30 to 40 feet high and measure 30 feet wide directly behind home plate, with 40-foot extensions running parallel with the baselines from either end. For a 30-foot height, dig foundation holes 2 feet in diameter and 7.5 feet deep for the supports. For a 40-foot height, make your holes 9.5 feet deep. Once they are placed inside each hole, secure the poles firmly in place by filling the hole with concrete.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   An increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container increases the pressure.   Q: What happens when an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container happens?   A: Answer:","output":"When an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container occurs, it leads to several phenomena taking place at molecular and macroscopic levels that result in an increase in the gas pressure inside the container. In order to understand the processes that occur, we can consider the Kinetic Theory of Gases and the Ideal Gas Law as our guiding principles. The Kinetic Theory of Gases states that all gases are composed of molecules in constant random motion. These molecules collide with each other and the container's walls, resulting in a force acting on the walls of the container. This force per unit area is what we perceive as pressure. When we increase the temperature of a gas, we are essentially providing thermal energy to the gas particles. This extra energy results in an increase in the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. The Ideal Gas Law establishes a relationship between pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and the number of gas particles (n) as follows: PV = nRT where R is the ideal gas constant. In the scenario of a rigid container, the volume (V) does not change. Therefore, when the temperature (T) increases, it directly causes an increase in pressure (P), if the number of particles (n) and the ideal gas constant (R) remain the same. Now let's discuss the two main factors that occur when the temperature of a gas in a rigid container is increased: 1. Increased molecular speed: As the temperature is increased, the gas molecules gain more kinetic energy, which results in an increase in their individual speeds. As these faster-moving molecules collide with the container's walls, the force exerted on the walls increases. Since pressure is the force exerted per unit area, this directly results in an increase in pressure. 2. Frequency of molecular collisions: With an increase in temperature and molecular speeds, the gas molecules also collide more frequently with the container's walls. Each collision transfers momentum from the molecule to the wall, which then exerts a force on the wall. The higher the frequency of collisions, the higher the force exerted. Consequently, the pressure inside the container increases. In conclusion, when an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container occurs, it causes the gas molecules to gain more kinetic energy and move at greater speeds. This directly leads to an increase in both the force exerted by the molecules on the container walls and the frequency of molecular collisions with the walls. As a result of these combined effects, the pressure of the gas inside the rigid container increases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)A war with Ukraine would be \\"apocalyptic\\" but will probably never happen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. \\"I believe such (an) apocalyptic scenario is unlikely, and hope that it will never get to that point,\\" he told Russian media Monday. Putin said he's confident the crisis will stabilize if the Minsk Agreement is implemented. The accord, between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany,  includes a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons. Despite frequent violations of the ceasefire, Putin said there's no need for immediate action beyond the Minsk Agreement, such as more international peace talks or the formal recognition of rebel separatist groups like the People's Republic of Donetsk and the People's Republic of Lugansk. \\"I really hope (the Minsk Agreement) is implemented, and if it is -- it is the right way to normalization of situation in that Ukrainian region,\\" Putin said. But the chaos on the ground in eastern Ukraine suggests the truce is crumbling. In the past week, shelling has intensified in the city of Donetsk. And on Friday, Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council reported 300 violations of the ceasefire, which was less than a week old. Ukraine has said its forces won't back down until attacks from the rebels stop. Pro-Russian separatists have also accused Ukraine of instigating violence. In his interview, Putin also said there's no chance Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia last year -- will go back in Ukraine. \\"Regarding the return of any territories, such things are of revengeful nature, and it is not about return of some territories somewhere,\\" Putin said. \\"Crimea will remain Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Greek, and German -- it will be a home to all these nations. With regard to its nationality, Crimean people made their choice, which we must respect.\\" On the streets of Moscow, many Russian point their fingers at the United States for the Ukraine crisis.

The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed since mid-April amid the fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops. Many of those killed were civilians. CNN's Erin McLaughlin and Elena Sandyrev contributed to this report.","output":"Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that a war with Ukraine would be \\"apocalyptic\\" but is unlikely to occur. He believes that the crisis will stabilize if the Minsk Agreement, which includes a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons, is implemented. Despite frequent violations of the ceasefire, Putin said there's no need for immediate action beyond the Minsk Agreement. However, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine suggests that the truce is crumbling, with shelling intensifying in the city of Donetsk and numerous ceasefire violations reported. On the subject of Crimea, Putin maintains that it will not revert to being part of Ukraine, which was annexed by Russia last year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed The Flying Scotsman, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but has lived almost all his life in Scotland and considers himself Scottish. An individual time triallist, his first race was a 10-mile time trial to which he turned up wearing shorts, anorak and Doc Marten boots. He thought the start and finish were at the same place and stopped where he had started, 100 metres short of the end. He had started to change his clothes when officials told him to continue. He still finished in \\"about 30 minutes.\\"  Obree suffers from bipolar disorder. He attempted suicide in his teens by gassing himself. He was saved by his father, who had returned early from work. In the 1990s he took an overdose of aspirin washed down by water from a puddle. He had personality problems, sniffed the gas he used to weld bicycles, and was being chased for PS492 owed in college fees.  The bike shop that he ran failed and he decided the way out of his problems was to attack the world hour velodrome record. It had been held for nine years by Francesco Moser, at 51.151 kilometres. Obree said:  The record had fascinated me since Moser broke it. It was the ultimate test - no traffic, one man in a velodrome against the clock. I didn't tell myself that I will attempt the record, I said I would break it. When your back is against the wall, you can say it's bad or you can say: 'I'll go for it.' I decided, that's it, I've as good as broken the record.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you don't have time or don't want to spend time exercising regularly, try increasing your daily lifestyle activities.  These are exercises you already do and increasing them can help you burn more calories throughout the day.  Think about your day and see if you can find additional ways to add in more steps or to move more.  A little planning can help you find a few ways to add in activity or find an extra few minutes to be active. Try adding in activity like:  taking the stairs over the elevator, parking far away from your destination and standing or walk in place during TV commercials. Make a rule to walk to your destinations if they are under 1 mile (if safe and appropriate for you).  Skip taking the bus or driving. Going to the gym, doing high intensity aerobic classes or spending money on expensive equipment isn't possible or comfortable for everyone.  Walking is an activity that most healthy people can do that can help burn calories and increase your cardiovascular fitness.  If you walk 30 minutes on five days of the week, you'll be meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity (150 minutes per week).  If you don't have time for a full 30 mins, try breaking up your walk into three 10 minute increments. You don't have to spend hours in the gym or purchase expensive equipment to include strength training.  Even light weight resistance training can help increase muscle mass and muscle tone.  Again, you can break up your strength training routine into 10 minute increments if it fits better into your schedule. Try including exercises that are easy to do at home and require no extra equipment.  Exercises can include:  sit ups, push ups, tricep dips, lunges or side leg lifts. Sometimes people think exercise just means running on a treadmill, but there are tons of ways to get exercise, inside and outside the gym. Try a new machine at the gym, or go for a long bike ride or a challenging hike. Try jumping rope or playing hopscotch with your kids or younger siblings.   Put on some upbeat music and dance around your house. This is a fun way to get your heart rate up and get some exercise. Make walking fun by taking an interesting tour or visiting a local museum. Or try skipping instead of walking or running. Play a sport.  Try joining a local soccer, tennis or basketball team for a fun and exciting way to be active.

Options: - court room - chicken coop - backyards - natural history museum - cherry tree  Explain why a human would choose \\"cherry tree\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"cherry tree\\" as the answer to the question, \\"Where would a weasel go if it is hungry?\\" for several reasons, primarily related to the weasel's natural environment, behavior, and dietary preferences. It is important to first eliminate the other available options to understand why \\"cherry tree\\" is the most suitable answer among the choices provided. 1. Courtroom: A courtroom is an indoor, human-built environment where legal proceedings take place. It is highly unlikely for a weasel to be present there, as courtrooms are not natural environments for weasels and do not offer them food. Moreover, weasels have no interest in human legal affairs. 2. Chicken coop: Although a weasel might invade a chicken coop to prey on small and vulnerable birds, it is not their ideal hunting environment. Weasels mainly hunt smaller mammals, but avian prey is a secondary option for them. A chicken coop could also potentially be located within or near a farm, posing risks to weasels due to human activity. 3. Backyards: While it is possible to find weasels in the backyards of homes that are close to their natural habitats, a backyard alone doesn't provide an inherent guarantee of food for a hungry weasel. The availability of food would depend on what specific vegetation, small mammals, and other prey species are present in that particular backyard. 4. Natural History Museum: This option can be easily ruled out as it is an indoor human-built environment specifically for showcasing exhibits, artifacts, and information about the natural world. This setting would not provide natural food sources or an appropriate environment for a weasel. Now, let's consider \\"cherry tree.\\" Weasels are small, carnivorous mammals that primarily live in forested areas and grasslands. Their natural diet consists of small mammals like mice, voles, and rabbits but also includes bird eggs and insects. A cherry tree, being part of a forested or wooded ecosystem, provides an ideal environment where a weasel can find food sources, especially bird nests containing eggs. Furthermore, cherry trees can attract insects due to their flowers and fruit, which weasels might consume opportunistically. When comparing the available options, humans would reasonably conclude that \\"cherry tree\\" is the most likely and suitable place for a hungry weasel to go in search of food. This choice provides the most favorable natural environment for the weasel to locate prey, in conjunction with the animal's typical dietary preferences and behaviors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","output":"To find out if Thomas should increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions to get a similar rate as Justin's reactions, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and reaction rate. Step 1: Consider the effect of temperature on reaction rate. As mentioned, higher temperature leads to faster reaction rates due to an increase in energy and movement of particles. They collide more often and with greater force, increasing the chances of successful reactions. Step 2: Compare the reaction conditions of Justin and Thomas. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. Given the relationship between temperature and reaction rate outlined in the first step, Justin's reactions will have a faster rate. Step 3: Determine how Thomas can modify his reaction conditions to match Justin's reaction rate. To achieve a reaction rate similar to Justin's, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions. This will cause the particles in his reactants to have more energy and move faster, leading to more frequent and forceful collisions, and therefore increasing the rate of his reactions to a level comparable to Justin's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The World Wars refer to the two major global conflicts that occurred in the 20th century, namely World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). These wars involved a majority of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, which were organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers in World War I, and the Allies and the Axis Powers in World War II. The culmination of these wars resulted in significant political, cultural, economic, and social changes across the world. World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which led to a series of diplomatic crises and eventually the mobilization of European alliances. The war was primarily fought between the two aforementioned alliances, with the Central Powers consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, while the Allies included France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States, among others. The conflict was marked by trench warfare, the introduction of modern weaponry and technology like chemical gas and machine guns, and the massive loss of life. The war ended in 1918 with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed heavy reparations and restrictions on Germany, leading to widespread economic and political instability in Europe. World War II began in 1939, largely as a result of long-standing issues left unresolved by World War I and the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, along with the aggression of Imperial Japan and Fascist Italy, led to the formation of the Axis Powers. They sought to expand their territories and influence, which triggered the start of the war with the invasion of Poland by Germany. The Allies, including the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and France, fought against the Axis in a series of campaigns spanning across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Significant events during the war include the Holocaust, the Battles of Stalingrad and Midway, and the D-Day invasion of Normandy. World War II came to an end in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis Powers and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The Korean War, which began in 1950 and continued until the signing of a ceasefire in 1953, was a conflict between North Korea, backed by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea, supported by the United States and other Western nations. The war began when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, attempting to reunify the Korean Peninsula under communist rule. The conflict soon escalated, with both sides receiving military assistance from their respective allies. Major battles during the Korean War included the Battle of Inchon and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. The fighting eventually led to the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which divides the peninsula along the 38th parallel. Although an armistice was signed in 1953, no formal peace treaty has ever been established, and tensions still exist between North and South Korea. In summary, the World Wars were momentous global conflicts that resulted in massive casualties, political upheaval, and significant changes in the world order, marking the end of old empires and the rise of new superpowers. The Korean War, while more localized, demonstrated the growing tensions between East and West during the early years of the Cold War and has had long-lasting effects on the relationships between the countries involved."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

Write an article with the title: \\"Fed Rate Rise Could Come ‘Relatively Soon’ as Data Point to Stronger Economy\\" Article:","output":"Title: Fed Rate Rise Could Come 'Relatively Soon' as Data Point to Stronger Economy Introduction Recent economic data suggests that a stronger economy could be on the horizon, leading to the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate rise relatively soon. As inflation indicators and economic growth metrics point to an improving domestic environment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may be inclined to increase the federal funds rate. This article examines the factors at play and the potential implications that a rate hike could have on the financial markets and the wider economy. Economic Factors Influencing a Rate Hike Decision Several key economic indicators are bolstering the case for a rate hike in the near term. These factors include the following: 1. Lower Unemployment: The US unemployment rate has decreased steadily, reaching a near multi-decade low and reflecting a resilient labor market. 2. Inflation: The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, has been inching closer to the Fed's 2% target, an important threshold for the central bank. 3. GDP growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data signals a stronger economy with steady growth rates in recent quarters, surpassing many analyst expectations. 4. Consumer Confidence: Consumer confidence has been rising, with retail sales displaying a healthy upward trend, suggesting increased economic activity and spending. Potential Implications of a Rate Hike A rise in the federal funds rate could have wide-ranging implications for both the financial markets and the broader economy. 1. Positive Implications: - Economic Growth: A rate hike signals confidence in the strength of the economy and can lead to increased investment, which in turn could stimulate further growth. - Currency Strength: Higher interest rates could attract foreign investment, leading to a stronger US dollar and consequently, lower import prices. This may contribute to a healthier trade balance. - Controlling Inflation: By raising interest rates, the Fed effectively makes borrowing more expensive and can help to keep inflation in check, ensuring it does not outpace economic growth. 2. Negative Implications: - Increased Borrowing Costs: A rate hike would increase the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses, potentially leading to reduced spending, investment, and economic activity. - Stock Market Volatility: Higher interest rates can negatively impact stock prices, as investors adjust their expectations for future earnings and discount rates. This volatility can create uncertainty in financial markets. - Debt Burdens: As borrowing costs rise, both consumers and corporations with significant debt loads may feel increased pressure, potentially leading to higher default rates and financial stress. Preparing for a Rate Hike Market participants, businesses, and consumers should begin preparing for the potential implications that a rate hike may bring. This includes considering the following steps: 1. Diversifying investments: Investors should ensure that their portfolios are adequately diversified to protect against the potential for market volatility and changing perceptions of risk. 2. Refinancing debt: Consumers and businesses with high levels of variable-rate debt may consider refinancing to lock in lower rates before they climb higher. 3. Building savings: In the face of potentially higher borrowing costs, individuals should focus on building a solid financial foundation by bolstering emergency funds and reducing reliance on credit. Conclusion The possibility of a Federal Reserve rate hike appears to be gaining traction as economic data points to a stronger economy. While the implications for financial markets and the broader economy are multifaceted, preparation is key. By staying aware of economic trends and making prudent financial decisions, individuals and businesses can better adapt to the changing interest rate environment and weather any potential storms that may arise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The move could hasten impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff, correspondents say. Opposition lawmakers want to remove Ms Rousseff over claims she manipulated accounts to hide a growing deficit. Following Tuesday's vote, the embattled president cancelled a trip to attend a summit in Washington this week. At its leadership meeting on Tuesday, the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] decided that its six remaining ministers in President Rousseff's cabinet must resign or face ethics proceedings. Brazil tumbles like 'House of Cards' Rousseff faces perfect storm Brazil's bigger threats What's gone wrong? \\"The decision was taken by acclaim in a historical meeting marking the withdrawal from Dilma (Rousseff's) government,\\" Senator Romero Juca tweeted [in Portuguese]. The announcement came a day after tourism minister Henrique Eduardo Alves from the PMDB stood down. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Sao Paulo says President Rousseff could now be temporarily suspended from office by Congress as early as May. She would be replaced by Vice-President Michel Temer, leader of the PMDB, while the Senate decides if she should permanently leave her post, our correspondent adds. Speaking before the vote, Osmar Terra, a lawmaker from the PMDB, said he had little doubt which way it would go. \\"It will be a goodbye to the government,\\" he said. Analysts say a considerable number of lawmakers from the PMDB have felt uneasy about their alliance with the left-wing Workers' Party for a while. The impeachment process centres on the question of whether Dilma Rousseff used illegal accounting manoeuvres or not. But in practical terms, MPs and senators are looking mostly on whether she has the strength and legitimacy to rule Brazil, as the country faces a severe economic crisis as well as a political one. The PMDB was the first major coalition partner to jump ship. It is also the group that has most to gain should Ms Rousseff be impeached. Mr Temer has reportedly been talking to opposition leaders and working on forming a cabinet. But despite her weakened stance, Ms Rousseff and her Workers' Party still have support from many in Congress and in the streets. There will be a lot to play for in the coming days. Critical month for Rousseff Their unease has been compounded by calls for Ms Rousseff's impeachment and a widening corruption scandal involving senior members in the Workers' Party. The president needs one third of the members of the lower house of Congress to vote against her impeachment for the proceedings to be shelved. Without the PMDB, she could lose as many as 69 votes at once in the 513-member Chamber of Deputies. Another of Ms Rousseff's coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (PSD) said it had given its lawmakers a free vote in any possible impeachment proceedings. On Monday, Ms Rousseff's mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, likened the moves to impeach her to a coup. But Lula himself is under pressure. The Supreme Court suspended his appointment as Ms Rousseff's chief of staff earlier this month and is due to take a final decision on the matter next week. Opponents of the government said the president had given Lula the post so he could escape investigation and possible proceedings over allegations of money laundering. Under Brazilian law, cabinet members can only be investigated by the Supreme Court, not by lower courts. There have been mass protests demanding the impeachment of President Rousseff in cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But there have also been rallies in support of the government by those who say the president is the victim of a campaign to drive the Workers' Party from government. Summary:","output":"Brazil's largest party, PMDB, has abandoned its alliance with President Dilma Rousseff's Workers' Party, increasing the likelihood of her impeachment over claims of hiding the growing deficit through account manipulations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

What is the last name of the person who established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London in 1934?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

The store was really bright and colorful, like a big box of crayons. There were so many ice cream flavors, even ones that you wouldn't think about - like bubblegum and cotton candy! 🍦 The person behind the counter who helps us choose our ice cream was very friendly and patient. They let us taste some of the flavors before we picked the one we wanted. I chose a big scoop of chocolate ice cream with rainbow sprinkles, and it was the yummiest ice cream ever! 😋 We also had fun playing with the toys in the play area while eating our ice cream. They had a slide and a ball pit which made it extra special. My little brother and I didn't want to leave! Happy Scoops made my whole family smile, and we can't wait to go back for more ice cream and fun times. If you love ice cream and want to have a great time, you should definitely go to Happy Scoops! 🍨🌈🎉"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Karen Rodger, 41, welcomed her first pair of girls rowan and Isla after having twice given birth to twin boys.  \\"I still haven't really taken it on board because I was convinced I was having two boys,\\" Rodger told Sky News. Karen said her husband Colin was equally stunned when the couple learned they were going to have their fifth and sixth child. \\"He thought I was joking and immediately wrote back to say 'this is not funny'.

Meanwhile, the concerns raised by major players such as Lloyds Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, John Lewis, and now BP, are not only indicative of the uneasy business climate surrounding the prospect of an independent Scotland, but also further fuel the arguments of the No camp that separation could pose significant risks to the economic stability and growth of the nation.

In case A he stirred the solution, but in case B he didn't stir the the solution. In case C he heat the solution up, but in case D he cooled the solution down. In case E he used finely ground solute, but in case F he used cubes of solute.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which case the solute would have larger surface area, case E or case F? A:","output":"In the given paragraph, John adds solute to a solvent under six different conditions, looking at various factors that affect the dissolution process. Among these conditions, the differences in solute surface area are investigated in case E and case F.  In case E, the solute is finely ground, while in case F, the solute is in the form of cubes. The surface area of a solute is a crucial factor in determining the rate at which it dissolves, as a larger surface area allows for more contact between the solute and the solvent molecules. This increased contact results in more collisions and interactions between the molecules, leading to faster dissolution. Comparing case E and case F, the finely ground solute in case E would have a larger surface area than the cubic solute in case F. This is because the particles in case E are much smaller, and the total exposed surface of all the particles combined is significantly greater than that of a few larger cubes in case F.  When a substance is ground or crushed into smaller particles, the surface area increases, enabling more solvent molecules to interact with the solute particles simultaneously. In case F, with the solute in the form of cubes, there is less overall exposure, fewer interaction points, and reduced collisions between the solute and solvent molecules, which results in a slower rate of dissolution compared to case E. Therefore, the solute would have a larger surface area in case E, where the solute is finely ground, compared to case F, where the solute is in the form of cubes."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Hengameh Shahidi\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are the names of some of the women in prison charged for being women's activists?\\"? Choices: a. no b. yes","output":"b. yes The correct answer is 'yes' because the paragraph mentions Hengameh Shahidi as one of the women's rights activists who have been sent to prison for their activism.

I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","output":"Jeff would play basketball better due to his size. The reasoning behind this choice is as follows: 1. Basketball is a sport where height can be a significant advantage. A taller player has longer arms, which can make shooting and blocking shots easier, and they can also reach the basketball hoop more easily for scoring points. 2. Soccer, on the other hand, is a game where height is not necessarily an advantage. Soccer requires more footwork and agility and height doesn't necessarily give an advantage in these aspects. Taller players might even find it a significant disadvantage at times, where lower body strength and agility become critical.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America.  When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia.  He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family.  Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture.  Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.  This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot.  Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales.

Movie plot title: Balls of Fury Movie plot: Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the 1988 Summer Olympics table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the German Democratic Republic, Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong. Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him.

Kayla does not get a lot of enjoyment our of life anymore like Cynthia because","output":"Kayla does not get a lot of enjoyment out of life anymore like Cynthia because she has been going through a rough patch lately. Several different factors have contributed to her current state of unhappiness, and she struggles to find joy in the things that once brought her immense satisfaction. First, Kayla's job has become quite monotonous and unfulfilling. She works long hours at a corporate office where her creativity is stifled, and the demands of her superiors weigh heavily on her shoulders. The constant stress and lack of excitement in her career have taken a toll on her overall well-being. Additionally, the long hours have left her with little personal time, making it even more challenging to pursue interests or hobbies outside of work. Second, several of Kayla's close relationships have suffered due to various reasons. Losing contact with friends who have moved away or simply drifted apart has left her feeling isolated and lonely. With fewer people around her for support and camaraderie, Kayla finds it harder to stay positive and optimistic in the face of life's difficulties. Furthermore, a recent breakup with her significant other has added to her feelings of sadness and abandonment. Third, Kayla's once-vibrant social life has dwindled in recent years. Once a fixture in her local community, she now finds that her peers are increasingly focused on their own lives, careers, and families. The lack of social interaction and genuine connection with others has left her craving more meaningful relationships and experiences. On the other hand, Cynthia has managed to maintain a sense of enjoyment in her life for several reasons. Firstly, she has pursued her passions and turned them into a career, allowing her to find happiness in her work. This fulfillment and sense of purpose have helped her remain enthusiastic and upbeat about her everyday life. Secondly, Cynthia has made it a priority to cultivate and maintain close relationships with her friends and family. She understands the importance of a strong support system in maintaining emotional well-being. By investing in these relationships, Cynthia always has a network of people she can lean on during difficult times. Lastly, Cynthia is an active member of her community and makes a conscious effort to engage with others. She participates in local events, volunteer opportunities, and clubs, which allows her to cultivate new friendships and create a sense of belonging. This active engagement with her community keeps her connected and prevents feelings of isolation. In conclusion, Kayla's unhappiness stems from a combination of a draining career, difficult personal relationships, and a dwindling social life. However, by following Cynthia's example in finding a fulfilling career, cultivating strong personal relationships, and actively engaging in one's community, Kayla has the potential to rediscover joy and satisfaction in her life. It will take time, effort, and possibly some support from a counselor or therapist, but there is hope for Kayla to rekindle her lust for life and find happiness once again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  But I can use this background: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.  What is an answer for this question: Which island displayed more seismic waves?

A: OPT:  (a). geology  (b). methodology  (c). biology  (d). taxonomy A:","output":"The name of the science that is concerned with naming and grouping organisms is (d). taxonomy.  Taxonomy is a sub-discipline of biology that focuses on identifying, naming, and classifying organisms based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. The term \\"taxonomy\\" is derived from the Greek words \\"taxis\\" (meaning \\"arrangement\\" or \\"order\\") and \\"nomos\\" (meaning \\"law\\" or \\"knowledge\\"), which together signify the science of classification. The history of taxonomy dates back to ancient times when classification systems were developed to categorize and study plants, animals, and minerals. However, the modern system of taxonomy is chiefly attributed to the works of Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who significantly contributed to the development of binomial nomenclature - the method of naming organisms using a two-part scientific name, genus, and species. For example, Homo sapiens is the scientific name for humans, where \\"Homo\\" represents the genus and \\"sapiens\\" indicates the species. The goal of taxonomy is to provide a systematic framework for organizing, studying, and understanding the immense diversity of life forms on Earth. This is accomplished by grouping organisms into hierarchical categories based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. These categories are often referred to as taxonomic ranks. The primary taxonomic ranks, from most inclusive to most exclusive, are Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. There are also subcategories within these ranks, such as subphylum and infraclass, which work to classify organisms even further. Over time, advancements in molecular biology and genetics have led to revisions in taxonomic classifications, as well as the discovery of new organisms and the reclassification of existing ones. Techniques such as DNA sequencing allow scientists to examine the genetic makeup of organisms, providing more precise and accurate information about their relationships within the tree of life. Consequently, taxonomy is a continuously evolving field, with modifications being made to reflect the latest discoveries and insights into the natural world. In conclusion, taxonomy is the scientific discipline that deals with the naming, classification, and grouping of living organisms based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary histories. This vital field of study helps us understand and appreciate the intricate connections and relationships between different life forms, which is essential for effective conservation measures, the development of new medicines, and the advancement of our understanding of biodiversity on our planet."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a passage and a yes/no question based on the passage. You should answer the question using the information from the passage. Q: passage: An American Dietetic Association study found that cast-iron cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food. The amounts of iron absorbed varied greatly depending on the food, its acidity, its water content, how long it was cooked, and how old the cookware is. The iron in spaghetti sauce increased 945 percent (from 0.61 mg/100g to 5.77 mg/100g), while other foods increased less dramatically; for example, the iron in cornbread increased 28 percent, from 0.67 to 0.86 mg/100g. Anemics, and those with iron deficiencies, may benefit from this effect, which was the basis for the development of the lucky iron fish, an iron ingot used during cooking to provide dietary iron to those with iron deficiency. People with hemochromatosis (iron overload, bronze disease) should avoid using cast-iron cookware because of the iron leaching effect into the food.  question: does enameled cast iron leach iron into food? A:","output":"Part 1: Passage provided about cast-iron cookware and iron leaching. Usage: \\"An American Dietetic Association study found that cast-iron cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food.\\" This part of the passage provides the main idea that cast-iron cookware can cause iron to leach into food. Part 2: Factors that affect the amount of iron absorbed. Usage: \\"The amounts of iron absorbed varied greatly depending on the food, its acidity, its water content, how long it was cooked, and how old the cookware is.\\" These factors give insight into why different amounts of iron may be absorbed into various types of food when using cast-iron cookware. Part 3: Specific examples of iron absorption increases.

To show off your waistline, tuck the blouse in, or simply tuck in the front. The blouse can be a solid color or patterned. You can also pair the blouse with a jacket or thin belt. It’s best to tuck the sweater in so that your look isn’t too bulky. Mom jeans are baggier than most other jeans, and combined with an untucked sweater, your form won’t be very distinct.  Put on your favorite over-sized sweater and try tucking in the front part. You want the waistline of your jeans to be noticeable. If your sweater isn't super bulky, try tucking in all of it for a sophisticated look. Pair it with a belt if desired. Off-the-shoulder tops are a great choice when you want to wear a more loose-fitting shirt with your jeans. They’ll balance out the shape of your mom jeans by showing off your shoulders while also giving you a bohemian look. Since most mom jeans are high-waisted, pairing them with a crop top is a popular choice. Crop tops allow you to show off your waistline, and they come in all forms — from loose-fitting t-shirts to tight spandex tops. Try out some different styles and see which one you like the best. If you don’t own a crop top but have an old shirt that you think would look good as one, you can make your own. The classic white t-shirt and jeans look has always been in style. Choose any white shirt — it could be a t-shirt, button down, or v-neck — and wear it with your mom jeans. This outfit will allow you to accessorize with any color of jewelry and shoes. The white shirt goes great with almost any jacket as well.  If you're wearing a white t-shirt, pair it with a bomber jacket or kimono. A button down white shirt goes great with a blazer. Since mom jeans are pretty loose-fitting in the leg area, you can balance this out by sporting a tighter top. Put on a bodysuit under your jeans to show off your curves while still being comfortable.

The game was an injury-laden game for both teams, with a total of seven players lost for both teams, with Chicago losing five (Lance Louis , Chris Spencer , Matt Forte , Devin Hester , and Charles Tillman ), while Minnesota lost Kyle Rudolph and Harrison Smith to concussions. The Bears first offensive play resulted in Matt Forte fumbling for the first time all season when he ran into Evan Rodriguez, and had the ball recovered by Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway. The Vikings then scored a field goal on Blair Walsh's 40-yard field goal. The Bears then struck back when Nick Roach stripped the ball from Adrian Peterson, which was recovered by Tillman. Jay Cutler, returning from the concussion he sustained two weeks prior, moved the ball downfield to the Vikings one-yard line, where Michael Bush ran in to give the Bears the lead. The Bears closed out the quarter with a 10-3 lead after Gould kicked a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Bears scored again on Bush's second one-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing extra point, holder Adam Podlesh faked the kick and ran in to give the Bears two points. Chris Conte would eventually intercept Christian Ponder at the 48-yard line and return the interception 35 yards to the Vikings 13-yard line. Cutler then hit Matt Spaeth in the left corner of the end zone to increase the score to 25-3.

When we talk about numbers, an even number is a number that you can divide by 2 without anything leftover. For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on are all even numbers. However, numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on are odd numbers because if you divide them by 2, you have something left over. So, 91 is not an even number, it's an odd number. Therefore, the sentence \\"Princess Antoinette lived for an even number of years\\" does not follow the given preceding text, because she lived for 91 years, which is an odd number."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Wonderfully Dirty Review: Bought this for my brother who was recently stationed in Japan.

Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which frog will have more tissue broken down? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it cannot be definitively concluded which frog, Frog X or Frog Y, will have more tissue broken down. However, we can discuss the potential factors that may contribute to tissue breakdown in each frog and make an informed speculation. Frog X, found in a pond in the forest, has a parasite present in its body. The presence of a parasite can potentially lead to the breakdown of tissues in the host, depending on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection. Parasites may induce an immune response in the host organism, which can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Additionally, some parasites directly consume or damage host tissues, leading to tissue breakdown. Furthermore, the breakdown of tissues could also happen because of other factors associated with living in the wild, such as injuries, nutritional deficiencies, or exposure to other pathogens. Frog Y, on the other hand, was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The fact that the frog is missing an eye could indicate the presence of some form of trauma or injury, which may have led to tissue damage or breakdown. The injury or the event that caused the eye loss could have also affected other tissues in the frog's body, leading to further tissue breakdown. Similar to Frog X, additional factors related to living in the wild and potential infections, even at a location close to the laboratory, may impact tissue breakdown in Frog Y. While it is possible that both frogs have experienced varying levels of tissue breakdown, we do not have enough information to accurately determine which frog will have more tissue broken down. Factors such as the type and severity of the parasitic infection in Frog X, the cause of Frog Y's missing eye, and any possible underlying health conditions or infections in both frogs would need to be considered and investigated in a laboratory setting before drawing a conclusion. In summary, although we cannot definitively determine which frog, Frog X or Frog Y, will have more tissue broken down, we can speculate on the potential factors that may contribute to tissue breakdown in each frog. A more comprehensive analysis of the health of both frogs and detailed examination of the specific parasite in Frog X and the cause of Frog Y's missing eye would be required to answer this question accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a subject line for this message: As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for \\"Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market\\" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02. (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.) However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended. OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, \\"include an explicit discussion\\"). As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information. We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner. We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale. We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task. The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02. (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.) OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when \\"commenters\\" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial. OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after \\"consulting with respondents\\", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted. FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.

A:","output":"To solve the task, you are asked to find the probability that the product of two integers, one from set m and one from set t, is negative. To do this, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes, which is the product of the number of elements in set m and the number of elements in set t. 2. Determine the number of outcomes that would result in a negative product. 3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of negative product outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes Set m has 5 elements, and set t has 5 elements, so there are a total of 5 * 5 = 25 possible outcomes. Step 2: Determine the number of outcomes that would result in a negative product Negative product outcomes can be achieved when one integer is positive and the other is negative. So we need to count the combinations of positive and negative integers in sets m and t: - Set m has no positive integers and 5 negative integers. - Set t has 3 positive integers and 2 negative integers. The combinations that will result in a negative product are: - One integer from the 5 negatives in set m and one integer from the 3 positives in set t: 5 * 3 = 15 combinations. Step 3: Calculate the probability Probability = (Number of negative product outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) Probability = 15 / 25 = 3 / 5 The probability that the product of the two randomly selected integers (one from set m and one from set t) will be negative is 3/5 or 60%."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Moulin Rouge! Context: In the year 1900, a British writer suffering from depression named Christian (Ewan McGregor) begins writing on his typewriter (\\"Nature Boy\\"). As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He soon encounters that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Zidler's Rap Medley\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\"). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night\\", \\"Meet Me in the Red Room\\"), but soon learns he is just a writer (\\"Your Song\\"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\". With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil maharajah attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor sitar player (\\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\\"). The Duke backs the show on the condition that only he may see Satine. Satine contemplates on Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become \\"a real actress\\" (\\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\").

Real GDP per capita (measured in 2009 dollars) was 52,444 in 2017 and has been growing each year since 2010. It grew 3.0% per year on average in the 1960s, 2.1% in the 1970s, 2.4% in the 1980s, 2.2% in the 1990s, 0.7% in the 2000s, and 0.9% from 2010 to 2017. Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are debated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population and growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate investment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major innovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220 countries in GDP per capita in 2017.  Among the modern U.S. Presidents, Bill Clinton had the highest cumulative percent real GDP increase during his two terms, Reagan second and Obama third. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many more real GDP per capita grew in the 1980s than the 1970s?","output":"To find the difference in real GDP per capita growth between the 1980s and the 1970s, we need to subtract the average growth rate from the 1970s from that of the 1980s.

Heavy rains cause flooding, and hurricane rains can cause landslides and flash floods. Given these facts, what is caused by flooding among the following options: - landslides  - desert  - sunlight  - drought  - Water expanding  - erosion  - contamination  - Pollution","output":"Flooding, a natural disaster, occurs when excessive amounts of water overflow from a water body, such as rivers, lakes, or the ocean, or after heavy rainfall. In extreme cases, hurricanes and other climatic events can also lead to floods. Among the given options, flooding is known to cause landslides, erosion, contamination, and pollution. 1. Landslides: Heavy rainfall or flooding can cause the ground to become saturated with water, resulting in landslides. Saturated soil weakens the structural integrity of slopes, leading to the downhill movement of rock, soil, and other debris. This can be particularly dangerous in hilly or mountainous areas, where the steepness and instability of the slopes increase the risk of landslides. 2. Erosion: Flooding can lead to erosion, the process where water gradually wears away the earth's surface, including rocks, soil, and other materials. Floodwaters, particularly those with high velocity, can significantly erode river banks, coastal areas, and other regions it contacts. This causes the landscape to change and may lead to additional hazards, such as the collapse of structures built on eroded land or the loss of fertile agricultural land. 3. Contamination: Floodwaters often mix with contaminants from various sources, such as sewage systems, industrial facilities, and agricultural lands. This can result in widespread water contamination, making the water unsafe for human consumption or use. Flooding can contaminate the water supplies of entire communities, posing significant health risks, including the spread of waterborne diseases and other illnesses. 4. Pollution: In addition to spreading contamination, flooding can also exacerbate pollution in various ways. For instance, floodwaters can carry pollutants like chemicals, oil, and waste from various sources, dispersing them throughout the environment. This can lead to the pollution of rivers, lakes, and other water bodies, which may harm aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems. Additionally, flooding can cause the overflow of hazardous waste facilities and other industrial sites, releasing dangerous substances into the environment. In conclusion, heavy rains and flooding are associated with several detrimental environmental effects, including landslides, erosion, contamination, and pollution. Communities and governments must take proactive measures to mitigate these consequences and protect both human life and the natural environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the real killer? Movie title: Scream Movie plot: The film opens with young Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) recieving phone calls from an unidentified caller. At first it seems as if he has gotten a wrong number, but it soon becomes clear he is toying with her, and his voice gets more and more threatening. Casey becomes frightened when she realizes her caller can see her. She begins to panic when the caller threatens to kill her, and forces her to answer movie trivia in exchange for her life and the life of her boyfriend, Steve, who she sees tied up on her back patio. After killing Steve, the caller torments Casey until finally breaking into the house and chasing her; he is dressed in a black costume with a white ghost mask over his face. He chases her across her lawn just as her parents pull up into the driveway. They do not see her, and Casey is stabbed in the chest, unable to scream. After killing Casey, the murderer strings up her body in the back yard for the parents to discover.We then meet Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). Billy sneaks into her bedroom window and attempts to have sex with her, but Sidney is unsure and wants to remain a virgin for now. They are almost discovered by Sidney's father, Neil (Lawrence Hecht), and he comes into Sidney's room to discuss the fact that he is going out of town.

The... Answer:","output":"The real killers in the movie \\"Scream\\" are Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). They work together, taking turns to don the ghostface costume and terrorize the town of Woodsboro. Both have their motives for committing the murders.  Billy Loomis is driven primarily by revenge against Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her family. He blames Sidney's mother, Maureen, for the disintegration of his own family. Maureen had an affair with Billy's father, which led to Billy's mother leaving the family. Out of anger and a twisted sense of vengeance, Billy resolves to kill Maureen. He and Stu concoct a plan and carry out the murder of Maureen one year before the events of the film take place. They frame Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) for the crime, who is eventually convicted largely based on Sidney's testimony. Stu Macher, although not bearing such personal grudges, is an eager accomplice to Billy. He is portrayed as being easily influenced and primarily motivated by a desire for notoriety and the thrill of evading capture. Stu is also revealed to be the one responsible for killing his ex-girlfriend, Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), in the opening scene of the movie. As the movie progresses, Billy and Stu carry out a series of murders, all the while taunting and stalking Sidney. The climax of the film occurs during a house party at Stu's residence. Here, they reveal their true identities to Sidney and plan to frame her father, Neil (Lawrence Hecht), for the murders. However, Sidney manages to outsmart and defeat them with the help of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), the news reporter, and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the horror movie enthusiast. In conclusion, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher are the real killers in the movie \\"Scream.\\" Their motivations stem from personal vendettas, a lust for infamy, and a fascination with horror movie tropes.

As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.

Having admired Park's achievements in the domain of bodybuilding from an early age, Schwarzenegger was deeply influenced by him, and their meeting further fostered this admiration. Through his relationship with Park, Schwarzenegger not only gained valuable inspiration that fueled his ambition, but he also got to learn directly from one of his greatest inspirations. This mentorship played an important role in Schwarzenegger's career development. After his intense training program devised by Bennett, Schwarzenegger eventually achieved the high esteemed title of Mr. Universe in 1967, at the age of 20, which made him the youngest ever Mr. Universe. He went on to win the title three more times in subsequent years. Schwarzenegger's determination and focus on his goal, coupled with the impactful guidance he received from influential figures in his life like Bennett and Park, greatly facilitated his iconic success in the realm of bodybuilding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film. Gun homicides. Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer. That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries. His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries).

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Disapproval of Donald Trump is at a new high, support for the Mueller investigation is broad and half of Americans in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against the president.      Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      Sixty percent in the national survey disapprove of Trump’s performance in office, numerically the highest of his presidency, albeit by a single point; that includes 53 percent who disapprove strongly, more than half for the first time. Thirty-six percent approve, matching his low.      See PDF for full results, charts and tables.      Mary Altaffer/AP, FILE      The results come a week after Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted of fraud, and his former longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including illegal campaign finance actions that he said Trump directed.      Trump’s average approval rating since taking office is the lowest for any president in modern polling since the 1940s. One factor: Contrary to his “drain the swamp” rhetoric, 45 percent say corruption in Washington has increased under Trump, while just 13 percent say it’s declined.      Jonathan Ernst/Reuters      Suspicions of the president relating to the Mueller investigation are substantial. Sixty-one percent say that if assertions by Cohen are true, Trump broke the law. Fifty-three percent also think Trump obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller’s work.      The national survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that half the public supports Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump, 49-46 percent; support rises to 57 percent among women. And support for the investigation running its course is broader: Americans overall back Mueller’s probe by 63-29 percent. Fifty-two percent support it strongly, a high level of strong sentiment.      Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE      Mueller prosecuted Manafort and referred the Cohen case to federal prosecutors in New York. Support for Mueller’s investigation peaks at 85 percent among Democrats, but also takes in 67 percent of independents and even a third of Republicans (32 percent). Forty-one percent of conservatives back Mueller, rising to more than seven in 10 moderates and liberals.      In Trump’s dispute with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing the investigation to proceed, the public sides with Sessions, 62-23 percent. Sixty-four percent also oppose the idea of Trump firing Sessions; just 19 percent support it.      Further, while Trump has railed against the Manafort prosecution, Americans call it justified by an overwhelming 67-17 percent, including nearly half of Republicans. The public opposes Trump pardoning Manafort by essentially the same margin, 66-18 percent, with 53 percent strongly opposed. Even among Republicans, 45 percent oppose a Manafort pardon; 36 percent support it.      The damage to Trump on these ethics concerns overwhelms his better rating for handling the economy, an essentially even split, 45-47 percent. That demonstrates that a good economy only makes it possible for a president to be popular – it’s no guarantee.      Approval, Groups      The president’s approval rating is highly partisan, but with relative challenges for Trump across the board. His job rating matches his low among Republicans (78 percent approve) and Democrats (6 percent) alike. It’s 35 percent among independents.      He’s at new lows among college-educated Americans (albeit just by a point; 29 percent approve), moderates (24 percent) and blacks (3 percent, with a nearly unanimous 93 percent disapproving).      The single biggest shift is among college-educated white women – just 23 percent now approve of Trump, down 17 points from the peak in April 2017, with disapproval up 20 points, from 55 percent then to 75 percent now. Still, even among non-college white men, a core Trump group, his approval is down 15 points, from 70 percent just this spring to 55 percent today.      Other Group Results      Trump’s approval rating is 12 points lower among women than men, and that gender gap is reflected elsewhere. As noted, 57 percent of women favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings; that drops to 40 percent of men.      Seventy percent of liberals support impeachment proceedings, declining to 51 percent of moderates and 30 percent of conservatives. Impeachment support is highest, a vast 80 percent, among blacks; 37 percent of whites agree.      Some of these gaps narrow on whether or not the charges against Manafort were justified. Two-thirds of men and women alike say they were, as do two-thirds of whites – including 64 percent of white men without college degrees. Even among Republicans, conservatives and those who approve of Trump’s work in office, more see the charges as justified than as unjustified, by 48-28, 49-30 and 47-29 percent, respectively. (The rest express no opinion.)      As noted, 45 percent of Republicans oppose Trump pardoning Manafort, with 36 percent support. It’s similar among conservatives, 46-34 percent. Trump approvers split about evenly on a Manafort pardon, with 39 percent opposed, 37 percent in favor.      Opposition to a pardon goes higher in other groups – 68 percent among men and 64 percent among women, for example (no real difference between them), 64 percent among whites and Hispanics alike, and 82 percent among blacks.      Sixty-one percent, as noted, say that if Cohen’s claim that he acted at Trump’s direction is true, Trump committed a crime. That view is lowest among Republicans, 28 percent. But there’s concern for Trump in other core groups: A substantial minority of conservatives, 41 percent, say he broke the law if Cohen’s telling the truth. So do 44 percent of evangelical white Protestants, 52 percent of whites and 52 percent of non-college white men, all groups whose support Trump needs.      Methodology      This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Aug. 26-29, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.6 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 33-25-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)      President Trump’s disapproval rating has hit a high point of 60 percent, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll that also finds that clear majorities of Americans support the special counsel’s Russia investigation and say the president should not fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions.      At the dawn of the fall campaign sprint to the midterm ­elections, which will determine whether Democrats retake control of Congress, the poll finds that a majority of the public has turned against Trump and is on guard against his efforts to influence the Justice Department and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s wide-ranging probe.      Nearly half of Americans, 49 percent, say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings that could lead to Trump being removed from office, while 46 percent say Congress should not.      [Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]      And a narrow majority — 53 percent — say they think Trump has tried to interfere with Mueller’s investigation in a way that amounts to obstruction of justice; 35 percent say they do not think the president has tried to interfere.      Overall, 60 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, with 36 percent approving, according to the poll. Because of random sampling variation, this represents only a marginal shift from the last Post-ABC survey, in April, which measured Trump’s rating at 56 percent disapproval and 40 percent approval.      The new poll was conducted Aug. 26 to 29, in the week after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of federal tax and bank fraud and after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty and implicated the president in illegal payments to silence women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump.      The four-month gap between Post-ABC polls makes it difficult to attribute the modest uptick in disapproval of Trump to specific events. Other public polls have shown Trump’s disapproval rating in the low- to mid-50s and have not tracked a rise since the Manafort conviction and Cohen guilty plea.      Trump has tried to rally support for Republican candidates in the Nov. 6 elections by pointing to his economic record. This week’s poll finds that despite the president’s unpopularity with voters, he gets better ratings when it comes to the economy: 45 percent of Americans approve and 47 percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.      [Trump at a precarious moment in his presidency: Privately brooding and publicly roaring]      Trump’s overall popularity breaks down along lines of partisanship, ethnicity and gender, according to the poll. While 78 percent of Republicans approve of his performance, 93 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of independents disapprove. More men support him than women, and while 45 percent of whites back him, 19 percent of nonwhites approve.      The poll finds that there are clear limitations to Trump’s efforts all summer to politicize and discredit the Russia investigation. The president has fired a near-daily barrage of tweets labeling the probe a “witch hunt” and attacking the credibility of Mueller and several current and former Justice Department officials.      But 63 percent of Americans support Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, with 52 percent saying they support it strongly; 29 percent oppose the probe.      Opinions on Mueller’s work also break down along partisan lines, with 61 percent of Republicans opposing the probe but an even larger 85 percent of Democrats expressing support. Among independents, however, a two-thirds majority of 67 percent back the investigation.      Trump has complained that Manafort was treated unfairly by Mueller’s prosecutors, and after a jury convicted Manafort last month, the president tweeted that he felt “very badly” for him.      But 67 percent of Americans think Mueller’s case against Manafort was justified, while 17 percent say it was unjustified, according to the poll.      Trump’s praise of Manafort has stirred speculation that he might pardon his former campaign chairman, but the poll finds that it would be a political land mine for the president. Two-thirds of Americans oppose Trump pardoning Manafort — 53 percent strongly oppose it — and 18 percent support a pardon.      Trump has ratcheted up his public attacks on Sessions in recent weeks and has consulted his personal attorneys and other advisers about firing the attorney general, whom he has viewed as insufficiently loyal after Sessions recused himself last year from overseeing the Russia investigation because of a conflict of interest.      But the public is squarely behind Sessions. Sixty-four percent of Americans do not think Trump should fire Sessions, with 19 percent saying he should and 17 percent saying they have no opinion. Nearly half of Republicans, 47 percent, say Trump should not fire the attorney general, with 31 percent saying he should.      Just under a quarter of Americans, 23 percent, say they agree with Trump’s criticisms of Sessions for allowing the Mueller investigation to proceed, while 62 percent say they side with Sessions, who has said he is following the law.      Two-thirds of Americans say they had read or heard at least some of the news about Cohen’s guilty plea to eight violations of banking, tax and campaign finance laws, though less than a quarter heard “a great deal” about the news.      Cohen told a federal judge last week that before the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump directed him to pay off two women to keep their stories of alleged affairs with Trump from becoming public.      [Michael Cohen says he worked to silence two women ‘in coordination’ with Trump to influence 2016 election]      The poll finds that 61 percent of Americans think that Trump committed a crime if he did direct Cohen to make the payments, while 31 percent say he did not commit a crime.      Democrats are hoping to retake control of one or both houses of Congress in November’s elections. If they do, party leaders will face pressure from their energized base to use congressional oversight committees to investigate potential misconduct by the president and his administration, as well as perhaps begin impeachment proceedings.      The survey finds a clear partisan divide on the issue. While 75 percent of Democrats say Congress should begin impeachment hearings, 82 percent of Republicans say lawmakers should not. Among independents, 49 percent support impeachment while 46 percent oppose it.      The Post-ABC poll was conducted among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on conventional and cellphones; the margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

The people in the city needed to go to different places, like work and school, so they used cars and bicycles to get there. One sad day, a very bad thing happened. A woman was driving her car and didn't pay enough attention to where she was going. As she was driving, she didn't see a person riding a bicycle near her. Because she didn't look, her car hit the person on the bicycle. This made the person on the bicycle very hurt. In fact, it was so bad that the person could not live anymore. Hitting someone with your car like that is also against the rules of the road. So, a lot of people got very sad and worried about what happened, and they wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. A judge, who is like a wise grown-up who helps make sure people follow the rules, needed to talk about this bad event. The judge wanted to find out why the woman driving the car didn't look and why she hit the person on the bicycle. The judge said that the driver should have been more careful when using her car, because cars can be very dangerous if people don't use them the right way.  In the end, the judge said that it was very important for everyone to follow the rules of the road and to always look and pay attention. This is how we can keep each other safe and not let bad things happen when we share the roads with cars and bicycles.

Both adultery and cohabitation are currently classified as second-degree misdemeanors, which could mean up to 60 days in jail for offending couples, according to Chapter 798 of the 2013 Florida Statutes.      Granted, even members of the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee agreed that although some people may consider cheating and cohabitating to be immoral, these laws are virtually impossible to enforce and unnecessary in this day and age.      Most officials won't admit it, but regulating what consenting couples do behind closed bedroom doors is just plain stupid.      But of course, Florida isn't the only state with archaic or otherwise bizarre laws. Above is a gallery (available here for mobile users) of some of the strangest laws across the country. ||||| If you're contemplating sex with a rodeo clown in Massachusetts, watch out: The long arm of the law may be coming for you.

Weirdly, though, Louisiana has no problem with people fucking corpses. It turns out they're not alone.      A quick survey of nationwide laws on sodomy and necrophilia shows that there are four states that explicitly ban the former in some way, while remaining silent on the latter:      In Louisiana and North Carolina, two willing adults can't get no oral satisfaction, but they can diddle a dead person.      Oklahoma and Kansas are also cool with you banging the dearly departed, but they ban oral intercourse between consenting gay or lesbian partners.      For the record, several other states—Nebraska, New Mexico, and Vermont—also appear to allow necrophilia, but they're cool with sodomy, too, so at least they're consistent.      It turns out there's actually a fraught history behind necrophilia and the law; many of the states that think they've banned it actually have vague injunctions banning \\"crimes against nature,\\" or they classify it as a sexual assault against a partner who can't give consent.      That leads to some trouble in the courts. In Wisconsin a few years back, three young men were arrested while trying to dig up a corpse for sex. Since the state didn't have an explicit necrophilia ban, they were charged with attempted sexual assault for their intent to have sex with an unwilling party. But an appeals court threw out their conviction, saying a corpse isn't a person under state law, and therefore consent isn't an issue. (The state Supreme Court, apparently afraid of suborning a corpse-banging epidemic, voted 5-2 to restore their conviction on shaky legal grounds.)      The problem is that \\"the dead body is a quasi-subject before the law,\\" according to legal theorist John Troyer in his landmark 2008 journal article on the subject, and \\"the ambiguous juridical standing of the human corpse in necrophilia cases compounds the sexual monstrousness of the necrophiliac and of necrophilic acts.\\"      In any case, it seems to offend our modern moral intuitions that any sex between consenting adults could be illegal, but sex with a dead person—can anyone be less willing than a corpse?—could be permissible.      Of course, Christian moralizers would say that's why all non-straight, non-missionary sex should be illegal: because parsing out the secular legal intricacies of various sex acts is a lot muddier than resting on the word of God.      That would be great!... if everyone believed in their God and their interpretation of that God's sexual laws. But hell, not even Louisiana legislators can apparently get on board with that thoroughgoing reasoning. And until they do, the anti-sodomy, anti-necrophilia religious right is just flogging a dead horse. (But not fucking it, obviously.)      Full map—red states are the anti-blowjobs, corpse-sex-friendly states:      (h/t Stuff You Should Know) ||||| Escorts Fail to Take Down Utah Sex Solicitation Law (CN) - Utah's sexual solicitation laws pass constitutional muster, the 10th Circuit ruled, disagreeing with a federal judge who found one provision of the statute too vague.      Three escort services - Bushco dba Babydolls Escorts, Companions LLC and TT II Inc. - had sued Attorney General Mark Shurtleff and Salt Lake Police Chief Chris Burbank over HB 121 in 2011.      Passed in March 2011, the law subjected sexually oriented businesses, or SOBs, to broadened statutes defining what activities constitute an intent to buy or sell sex.      It amended Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1313 by adding two new provisions, Sections 1313(1)(c) and 1313(2).      Subsection 1(c) says that a person may be arrested for soliciting sex if police believe the person had an \\"intent to engage in sexual activity for a fee.\\" Acts proscribed when commissioned for a fee include exposing \\"a person's genitals, the buttocks, the anus, the public area or the female breast below the top of the areola,\\" the touching of genitalia, masturbation and \\"any act of lewdness.\\"      Subsection 2 says that the \\"intent to engage in sexual activity for a fee may be inferred from 'a person's engaging in, offering to engage in, or requesting another to engage in any of the acts described' above 'under the totality of the existing circumstances.\\"      U.S. District Judge Dee Benson found subsection 2 \\"unconstitutionally vague\\" last year and ordered it severed and stricken from the statute.      The other section survived, and Benson also dismissed Burbank from the action as an unnecessary party.      Both sides appealed, but the state prevailed Monday, persuading a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit that both provisions should have been upheld.      They are not \\"unconstitutionally overbroad because they do not encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\\" Judge David Ebel wrote for the court.      The panel rejected the argument from the escort services that the amended statutes would \\"chill\\" a variety of protected expression, including \\"theatrical performers who use some of the enumerated exposure or touching to convey an artistic message.\\"      \\"Even assuming, without deciding, that the exposure and touching enumerated in the amendments is constitutionally protected expressive conduct under some circumstances, we nonetheless conclude that the amendments do not reach a substantial amount of protected speech,\\" Ebel wrote. \\"The statute only prohibits participation in the enumerated exposure or touching done with the intent to engage in, or pay for, sexual activity for a fee. On the face of the statute, it does not reach any touching or exposure done without that intent.      \\"In other words, the sexual solicitation statute does not criminalize the enumerated touching or exposure when done without the intent to participate in statutorily defined sexual activity for a fee. Thus, it does not reach the conduct of an actor clasping her breast as part of a stage performance or a wife touching her husband's buttocks during an embrace. The intent requirement contained in the statute ensures that the statute only criminalizes the enumerated touching and exposure when done with the intent to participate in, for a fee, statutorily defined sexual activity.\\"      Additionally, subsection 2 does not broaden police discretion to the point the provision \\"authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,\\" according to the 27-page ruling.      \\"Instead, it constrains the officer's discretion,\\" Ebel wrote.      In upholding the laws, the court relied on the four-prong test for justifying incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms created by the U.S. Supreme Court with the 1968 case United States v. O'Brien.      Here, Utah's amendments did not \\"place too great a burden\\" on the speech rights of escort services, according to the ruling.      \\"The District Court rejected the argument that § 1313(1)(c) was overbroad and held that the provision 'does not infringe on a substantial amount of protected speech,'\\" the 27-page ruling states. \\"The district court also held that the provision 'satisfies all four prongs of the O'Brien test and does not infringe on expression protected by the First Amendment.' We likewise hold that the amendments are not unconstitutionally overbroad and do not violate the First Amendment.\\" ||||| PA frowns upon truck drivers having sex in tollbooths, and the state of Utah is cool with bestiality (as long as no one’s trying to make a buck, that is).

Oxford, Ohio: It's illegal for a woman to strip off her clothing while standing in front of a man's picture.      11.

Choices:  - believe in god - migraine - complete high school - die suddenly - cross river  The rationale to choose \\"die suddenly\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"\\"die suddenly\\" due to various scientific, physiological, and statistical factors that contribute to the lethality of a gunshot to the head. In this detailed explanation, we will explore the reasons why a bullet to the head is likely to result in sudden death, making it the most logical choice among the given options. 1. Anatomical factors: The head houses the brain, which is the organ responsible for controlling and coordinating all bodily functions. The brain is protected by the skull, but a gunshot can penetrate this natural barrier. When a bullet enters the skull, it damages vital regions of the brain, including those responsible for critical functions such as breathing, heart regulation, and consciousness. Depending on the bullet's path and the damage it causes, the individual may experience instantaneous or near-instantaneous death. 2. Physiological factors: A gunshot to the head can cause extensive damage to the brain, resulting in immediate physiological consequences. These may include swelling, bleeding, and the release of chemicals and toxins from damaged tissue. These physiological factors contribute to the high likelihood of sudden death as brain function deteriorates rapidly after receiving such a traumatic injury. 3. High velocity and energy transfer: Bullets are typically fired at high speeds, making them capable of transferring a significant amount of energy upon impact. This energy transfer can result in severe skull fractures, bone fragments penetrating the brain, and large-scale tissue destruction. The combination of these factors greatly increases the chance of sudden death upon being shot in the head. 4. Medically induced factors: In cases where the gunshot victim does not die immediately, the resulting complications and medical interventions can contribute to death. Brain swelling, intracranial pressure, blood loss, and infection are just a few of the possible complications that can ultimately lead to death, even after the initial injury has been stabilized. 5. Statistical factors: According to numerous studies, gunshot wounds to the head have a mortality rate of above 90%, making them more likely to be fatal than any other type of firearm injury. This high mortality rate substantiates \\"die suddenly\\" as the most accurate answer to the question. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"die suddenly\\" as the answer to the question regarding the likely outcome of being shot in the head revolves around the unique combination of anatomical, physiological, and statistical factors. These factors overwhelmingly point to a high likelihood of death, making it the most logical choice among the given options. The other choices - \\"believe in god,\\" \\"migraine,\\" \\"complete high school,\\" and \\"cross river\\" - are simply not supported by scientific or statistical evidence in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let's further elaborate this. In the realm of physics, electricity represents the energy resulting from the existence of charged particles such as electrons or protons, either statically as an accumulation of charge or dynamically as a current. An electric conductor is a material that allows electric charges to pass through freely. These charges can either be negative (like electrons) or positive.  Essentially, when two conductive materials make contact, a pathway for electrons to move is formed. This movement of electrons from one point to another is what we call electric current or electricity. This flow of hence comes into being due to the voltage difference between the two conductors. It's important to note that the flow will continue until the voltage levels in the two conductors equalize, assuming there isn't a power source maintaining the voltage difference. Most metals are good conductors of electricity, some popular examples include copper, aluminium, gold, and silver. The reason why these materials are great conductors is due to their atomic structure. Metals typically have one or two electrons in their outer shell and these electrons are not tightly bound to the nucleus, hence they are capable of moving freely through the material when a voltage difference is applied. Therefore, in any typical electrical appliance or equipment, current travels from the power source across the wiring (conductor) and back again. That's why most wires comprise a metal conducting material, and touching or connecting these wires without proper caution can create an unintentional flow of electric current, thereby causing a short circuit. This could potentially lead to electrical fires or damaging the appliance connected. Further, the actual amount of electricity that flows through will greatly depend on the resistance of the conductors. According to Ohm's Law (Voltage = Current x Resistance), higher resistance results in lower current for a given voltage. Hence, while the conductive property of the material is the primary factor in allowing the flow of electricity, the flow can be regulated or hindered by the resistance of the circuit. To sum up, if one electrical conductor touches another one, electricity represented by the flow of electrons, will move through both."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a question about the following article: The Giants' defense was trashed by the media during Week 4, their bye week, as they had allowed a whopping 92 points in their first three games, roughly 31 per game. After forcing a punt, the Giants drove to the Washington 29, but Jay Feely was wide left on a 47-yard attempt. Aided by a William Joseph roughing-the-passer penalty on 3rd-and-11 that would have forced a Washington punt, Mark Brunell drove the Redskins to the Giants' 21, where John Hall nailed a 39-yard field goal. Manning was unfazed, finding Amani Toomer on a 44-yard completion to move the ball to the Washington 10, and apparently finding him for a touchdown pass of 5 yards three plays later, but the score was nullified by a Jeremy Shockey pass-interference penalty. Feely knocked in a chip shot of 24 yards to tie the score, 3-3, early in the second quarter. Manning would again use the big play to help the Giants to their next score, finding Plaxico Burress on a 46-yard completion that gave the Giants the ball at the Redskins' 22. Soon after, Feely hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Giants their first lead since Week 2. After forcing a punt, Manning led the Giants on a 14-play, 84-yard drive, capped by a 32-yard field goal by Feely, his third of the quarter and half.

Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged. But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim. The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer. Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m. Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992. Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home. Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale. The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house. It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland. It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated. Contentious: The pair fought over the luxurious mansion they built together in Thorntonhall, Glasgow. Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business. The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers. But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business. Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million. However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' Strathclyde University students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.","output":"Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone have negotiated a bitter divorce settlement, dividing up personal number plates, computer passwords, and a collection of small properties.

One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being \\"warriors\\" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. While the bird is being built, Hopper reveals to the other grasshoppers how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually turn on them. The bird is constructed, but during a celebration party, the truth about the circus bugs is revealed when P.T. Flea arrives searching for them.

Answer:","output":"Flik's latest invention in the movie \\"A Bug's Life\\" is a grain-harvesting device. This device is designed to efficiently collect and transport food for the ant colony. However, it accidentally causes the annual offering to be knocked into a stream, leading to the grasshoppers demanding twice as much food as compensation.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. <sep>For what country was the stabbed man a part of the military?<sep>Pakistan Output:","output":"No"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Editor's Note: Parag Khanna is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, visiting senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, and author of The Second World and How to Run the World. David Skilling is founding director at Landfall Strategy Group, a Singapore-based advisory firm. By Parag Khanna and David Skilling – Special to CNN In the current phase of globalization, financial, ecological, political and social crises are occurring simultaneously and magnifying each other in unpredictable ways. From the Fukushima nuclear meltdown reshaping German politics and the European power industry, to America’s sub-prime mortgage meltdown threatening the Eurozone, such chain reactions are undermining an already fragile stability. Large countries and blocs such as the U.S., China and the EU, and new groupings like the G-20 and the BRICS, are grappling with this unprecedented combination of structural challenges and black swans. But there is little evidence of real progress. Coordinated financial regulation remains a chimera, and domestic pressures are fueling the risk of protectionist measures and immigration barriers. The failures of the WTO’s Doha Round and the Copenhagen climate change talks are further evidence of the difficulties in making collective progress on global issues. Perhaps we need to look elsewhere for the next generation of policy innovations. Specifically, it is small countries and city-states (or city-regions) that are the locus of creative thinking today. Unlike the G-20, which brings together 20 countries that represent over 80 percent of the world economy and population, small, advanced economies – those with populations of under 20 million people – represent about 2 percent of world GDP and population. Yet from Sweden and Denmark to Singapore and New Zealand, small states boast an impressive track record of sustained policy innovation in areas such as economic reform, public sector restructuring, healthcare delivery, and educational performance. Because small countries are much more exposed and vulnerable to global developments, they have an acute understanding of globalization’s turbulent dynamics. They are open to the world by necessity, not choice, and have developed mature policy responses over a longer period of time. By the same token, small states tend to be good global citizens, both because they aren’t in a position to throw their weight around and also because they tend to have a large stake in global outcomes on issues such as climate change, exchange rate volatility and open markets. By contrast, big countries aren’t too big to fail. They don’t face the same pressure to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities, and are often slower to innovate. Interestingly, modernization occurs in selected pockets in large countries. In America, for example, policy dynamism is a local phenomenon. Massachusetts leads America in healthcare standards, while Florida is experimenting with smart grids for its utilities. Meanwhile, parts of the Midwest and South have stagnated in recent years. Indeed, cities and provinces around the world are assuming a more important leadership role on global policy issues, such as the C40 grouping of cities on climate change. Even big countries seem to work better in smaller parts. The same is true for global diplomacy. For decades it has been small states that have advanced the opening of global trade. And there are many more examples. The process spearheading global principles around sovereign wealth funds was hosted by Chile, the leading example of managing natural resource endowments for future generations comes from Norway and Singapore has led the world in economic development and urban technology and planning. All of these small states can and should actively export their ideas and experience around the world – even and especially to bigger states. For these reasons, it makes sense for a “g-20” to convene as often as the G-20 does. The g-20 would comprise small and innovative states such as Denmark, Finland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, and others. It would not be a universally representative or formal body – the G-20 is neither of these things either. And the “g-20” can be more open to inviting cities and companies with breakthrough ideas into its consultations as well. Global governance doesn’t suffer for lack of competitive groups and agendas, but there is an urgent need for groups focused on generating breakthrough ideas. The G20 is needed, but it is not enough. It is in this spirit that the “g-20” should convene to provide a platform for small states and actors to generate ideas that can overcome the inertia and positively impact the deliberations and actions of larger powers. The world needs big ideas now. They are more likely to come from small places. The views expressed in this article are solely those of Parag Khanna and David Skilling.

To do that, we will move the numbers to the other side of the equation. If we add 2782 to both sides of the equation, we get: 2782 = 146 * v Now, to find the value of 'v', we will divide both sides of the equation by 146. 2782 ÷ 146 = v When we divide 2782 by 146, we get:  v = 19 So the value of 'v' is 19."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Answer this question: what popular soft drink had its birthplace in waco texas??","output":"Dr Pepper, a popular soft drink, was born in Waco, Texas, back in the 19th century. This well-known beverage features a distinctive, unforgettable flavor and has a long and fascinating history. The inception of Dr Pepper dates back to the 1880s, when Charles C. Alderton, a pharmacist at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store, sought to create an inventive, refreshing drink for customers. Alderton, an Englishman, had a background in medicine and worked in the Waco area. As a pharmacist, he experimented with different combinations of syrup and carbonated water, driven by his desire to offer a novel and exciting palate experience for the patrons of the drugstore. During the course of his experiments, Alderton stumbled upon a unique blend of carbonated water and a secret mix of fruit syrups, which he believed was the perfect recipe. This new drink, initially known as the \\"Waco,\\" quickly caught the attention of passersby and began gaining popularity among the locals. Wade B. Morrison, the owner of the drugstore, also took notice of the growing interest and potential of the beverage, ultimately deciding to turn it into a marketable product. The name \\"Dr Pepper\\" was suggested by Morrison in honor of Dr. Charles T. Pepper, a physician and personal acquaintance. Although the true reason behind the name remains more of a speculation than a definitive fact, it is said that Morrison had once worked for Dr. Pepper and was grateful for the kindness and support the doctor had shown him. In 1891, Morrison teamed up with beverage chemist Robert S. Lazenby, who owned the Circle A Ginger Ale Company, to market the drink. Together, they founded the Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Works, which later became known as the Dr Pepper Company. Dr Pepper was first introduced to a broader audience at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, a world's fair held in St. Louis, Missouri, where it attracted significant attention. Today, Dr Pepper is a well-loved soft drink enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide. Over the years, the brand has gone through various ownerships and mergers, as well as numerous packaging and advertising innovations. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the company responsible for distribution and production of Dr Pepper, became a separate entity in 2008 and later merged with Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper in 2018. Despite its evolving corporate structure and progress, the Dr Pepper brand maintains its roots and continues to celebrate its birthplace in Waco, Texas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify.

Q: I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM as a teenager on \\"Cliffhanger Theater\\" running after midnight on a local station some years ago, and then again when Mystery Science Theatre riffed on it in the early 90's. Time has not been kind to it. I can certainly make allowances for the special effects, which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves/Superman's in his TV show). And I can also make allowances for the ahem, \\"acting\\", and fight choreography -. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He is incredibly miscast. He looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the corny dialog works all right - everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers, with no wasted time or pauses for things like \\"thought\\" or \\"introspection\\". Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after awhile, and even to my modern sensibilities, it doesn't bother much. What really irritates me is the writing and the plotting. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda powered rocket ships, or a flying suit that has controls labeled \\"up/down\\" and \\"fast/slow\\". I'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train, the plot goes through the same motions again and again. Dig it: Commando Cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting Earth (or at least the USA) against an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They don't even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk RIGHT IN and beat the crap out of the Cody and his staff ...not once (perhaps understandable) but SEVERAL times. They even kidnap his female assistant on the second try. And they never get any smarter. To further prove my point, allow me to point out the way that Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does this over and over and over. Cody also flies his ship to the Moon (the woman assistant comes along to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray guns...and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn't be bothered to lock it up. And so on.And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to saving the USA from the Moon Men, that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, instead of just working with the local police all the time. This was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like it's another episode of \\"Gangbusters\\". It's all rather hard to stomach. I appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints...and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre (even though he loses half of his fistfights). But I just can't help yelling \\"DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR!!\\" when the gangsters simply walk into his lab, or try to blow up the ship and there are NO security measures at the landing site in place...not even a fence (!). Still, it's OK. Of the three Republic serials I've watched, \\"Phantom Creeps\\" had a better plot, and \\"Undersea Kingdom\\" had more atmosphere (hah!) and a better hero than \\"Radar Men\\", but it's an OK time-waster. BTW...why \\"Radar\\" men? They didn't use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Shouldn't the title have been \\"Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?\\" A:","output":"In this task, you are given a movie review and asked to classify it as either positive or negative based on the content. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Read the review carefully and identify the reviewer's opinions and feelings about the movie. 2. Note if the reviewer talks positively or negatively about the movie, its actors, plot, special effects, or any other aspect. 3. Count the number of positive and negative comments or opinions in the review. 4. If the review has more positive comments than negative, classify it as positive (category 1). If it has more negative comments than positive, classify it as negative (category 2). For this given review, the reviewer makes the following notable points: - The special effects are impressive for a low budget 50's serial. - The acting is not that great, but it can be tolerated. - The writing and plotting are frustrating, particularly the repetitive nature and lack of character development. - Despite budget constraints, the main character could have been smarter and had better security measures. The reviewer has mixed feelings about the movie but leans more towards negative aspects. Therefore, the review can be classified as negative (category 2)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The \\"escape\\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of \\"escape\\" encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning.

Product review: It is a travesty that this spectacular event has not been released in full high-definition. I am baffled by this. The answer is:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. However, it is important to consider the context of the situation and the product being reviewed. I will explain the reasons below: 1. Limited format availability: The review title \\"Why No Blu-Ray?\\" suggests that the product may only be available in a lesser-quality format, such as DVD or digital. This may be an important factor for potential buyers who are looking for a high-quality viewing experience that is provided by Blu-Ray discs. Missing out on such an experience might disappoint customers, especially those who value visual and audio quality. 2. Baffled reviewer: The reviewer expresses their confusion and disappointment at the lack of a Blu-ray release, using words like \\"travesty\\" and \\"baffled.\\" This strong language implies that the reviewer might be a highly engaged consumer or an expert in the field, which can lend significant weight to their opinion and influence other potential buyers negatively. 3. Positive evaluation of the event: Despite the reviewer's disappointment regarding the format, they do describe the event as \\"spectacular,\\" indicating that the content itself may be of high quality. However, this aspect of the review would only serve to increase the chances of purchasing the product if potential buyers are willing to overlook the lack of a high-definition format. 4. Importance of reviews: Reviews play a critical role in shaping a potential buyer's decision-making process. A negative review, such as the one provided, can create doubts in the minds of prospective buyers. It can be particularly influential if there are not many other reviews to counterbalance the negative perspective. In conclusion, while the reviewer does praise the event as spectacular, their overall dissatisfaction with the lack of a Blu-Ray option is a significant drawback that may discourage potential buyers. Thus, the chances of purchasing the product in question would most likely decrease based on this review, unless the prospective buyer places little importance on having a high-definition format or the negative review is counterbalanced by a significant number of positive reviews."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\"?

Why not create a fake lip ring to achieve that edgy style without any permanent effects? Making a fake lip ring is simple, affordable, and a fun DIY project. In this article, we’ll guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your very own custom lip ring. Step 1: Gather the Materials To start, you'll need the following materials: - Wire, preferably made of a safe, non-toxic, and hypoallergenic material like stainless steel or niobium. - A kitchen pan. - Wire-cutting pliers. - A file, sandpaper, or an emery board. - Optional: beads, charms, or other decorations for customization. Step 2: Boil the Wire Boiling the wire in a kitchen pan serves to clean and sterilize the material, making it safe to wear. Fill the pan with water, and bring it to a boil. Submerge the wire in boiling water for a few minutes. Once complete, carefully remove the wire with a pair of tongs and let it cool down. Step 3: Cut Your Desired Length Using wire-cutting pliers, snip off a short length of wire (approximately 1 to 1.5 inches) for your lip ring. The length may vary depending on the size and final look you intend to create. Step 4: Smooth the Edges To prevent any injuries while wearing your lip ring, it's vital to smooth out any sharp edges. Use a file, sandpaper, or an emery board to gently rub away the rough edges until they are smooth and safe to touch. Step 5: Shape the Wire Bend the snippet of wire into a circle using your fingers or small round-nose pliers. Make sure the circle is big enough to fit around your lip comfortably without being too tight.  Step 6: Adjust the Overall Shape Take a moment to refine and adjust the overall shape of your lip ring. You may want to create a round or oval shape that follows the contours of your lip. Step 7: Create the \\"Gap\\" and the \\"Flat\\" The gap is where the lip ring will sit, and the flat is the part that rests against the inside of your lip. Gently bend the wire near the smoothed ends to create a small gap for the lip ring to slide on and off. Next, create the flat section by slightly bending the wire where it touches the inside of the lip. Step 8: Try On Your Fake Lip Ring Slide the fake lip ring onto your lip to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. If necessary, make any adjustments to the size or shape until you're satisfied with the fit. Step 9: Customize Your Lip Ring Get creative and customize your new lip ring with beads, charms, or other embellishments. Ensure that any decorations you add are also safe and hypoallergenic. Conclusion And there you have it--your very own DIY fake lip ring! With these simple steps, you can create a stylish and personalized lip accessory that brings an edgy look without the pain or permanence of a real piercing.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid. When spaceships are destroyed by hostile alien beings, there would be no sound heard. Sound waves can travel through many kinds of matter.

Q: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus., Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes.  Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a \\"button quail\\". Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the U.S. , Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds., In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs., Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest., The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \\"gallus\\", Latin for \\"cock\\" or \\"rooster\\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \\"Wildfowl\\" or just \\"fowl\\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans., Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction., The king quail (\\"Excalfactoria chinensis\\"), also known as the blue-breasted quail, Asian blue quail, button quail, Chinese painted quail, or Chung-Chi, is a species of Old World quail in the family Phasianidae. This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\" and is quite common in aviculture worldwide. In the wild they range from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies., Coturnix is a genus of eight extant species and two known extinct species of Old World quail . They are related to the francolins , jungle bush quail , snowcocks and rock partridges . Species of Coturnix and the aforementioned genera belong to their own monophyletic clade , Coturnicinae , a subfamily within the family Phasianidae . Some authors consider this clade , together with a sibling assemblage , the Gallininae ( including the junglefowl , long - billed partridge and Chinese bamboo partridge ) warrants classification in its own family , Coturnigallusinidae . Quail of Coturnix live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration . Not all species migrate , but most are capable of extremely rapid , upward flight to escape from danger . Unlike related genera , Old World quail do not perch in trees . They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground . Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands , bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields . They are predated upon heavily by the diurnal hawks ., In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies., Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus \\"Turnix\\" and only one being found in the genus \\"Ortyxelos\\"., The New World quails or Odontophoridae are small birds only distantly related to the Old World quail, but named for their similar appearance and habits. The American species are in their own family Odontophoridae, whereas Old World quail are in the pheasant family Phasianidae. The family ranges from Canada through to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan's partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. Thirty-four species are placed in ten genera. , The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae., Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus., Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix., Subject: coturnix, Relation: parent_taxon, Options: (A) animal (B) anseriformes (C) areas (D) charadriiformes (E) galliformes (F) gallus (G) grouse (H) helix (I) homo (J) human (K) ortyxelos (L) ostrich (M) perdicinae (N) phasianidae (O) phasianinae A:","output":"The task here is asking to identify the \\"parent_taxon\\" of the subject \\"coturnix\\" based on the given context.

Given the question: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Sentence 1: Those dueling Greek painters return in a new guise, as Mario Merz, in the Zeuxis role, covers a glass table with an array of fresh vegetables and fruit, changed daily by a New York caterer ( Spiral Table , 1982), while Christo, playing Parrhasios, conceals the familiar Cezannesque shapes--wine bottle, vase, etc.--under a drapery of canvas ( Package on a Table , 1961). Sentence 2: The two painters liked each other. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence describes a scenario where Mario Merz and Christo, two contemporary artists compared to the ancient Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasios, create artworks involving fresh vegetables and fruits arranged on a table (Merz's \\"Spiral Table,\\" 1982) and concealing everyday objects under canvas (Christo's \\"Package on a Table,\\" 1961). The sentence highlights the artists' unique approaches to their artistic expressions, drawing a parallel to Zeuxis and Parrhasios, who were known for their competing styles and skills in painting during ancient Greece.

Answer the following question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

Choices:  - pollen  - microbes  - bacteria  - pathogen  A: The answer is:","output":"- pathogen An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the type of pathogen involved. Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Intracellular pathogens live inside host cells, while extracellular pathogens live outside host cells. Intracellular pathogens, like viruses and some bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), have evolved to live and multiply within host cells. This allows them to evade the host's immune system and access nutrients inside the cells. They typically enter the host cells by either being engulfed by the host cell membrane or by injecting their genetic material inside the host cell. Extracellular pathogens, on the other hand, survive and reproduce outside host cells. These may include bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia) and fungi like Candida albicans (which can lead to yeast infections). Extracellular pathogens can colonize surfaces of host tissues, or they may secrete toxins or enzymes that damage host cells and tissues to obtain nutrients. The type of infection, whether intracellular or extracellular, often determines the most effective treatment approach, which may include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungal agents, or other therapeutic interventions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats.

The app does what it claims to do—provide a fast and secure platform for messaging. However, there are a few features that are lacking, which prevents me from giving it a full 5-star rating. First, while it offers various customization options in terms of background themes and chat colors, it pales in comparison to the rich customization available in competing apps. It would be nice to see a broader range of themes and personalization settings. Secondly, while the app is generally reliable, I have noticed occasional system crashes and delays in receiving messages. There have been times when the notifications come significantly later than expected. Lastly, the sticker options are quite limited, and many of the available sticker packs aren't very engaging. Offering more choices or allowing users to create custom stickers would be a great addition.

Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, let me first provide a brief background on both of the television series: Auction Kings and Pawn Stars. Auction Kings is a reality television series produced by Authentic Entertainment for the Discovery Channel. The show's premise revolves around the daily activities of a prominent auction house called Gallery 63, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Paul Brown, the owner, and his crew are involved in finding, buying, and auctioning various unique and valuable items. The series first aired on October 26, 2010, and ran for four seasons until late 2013. Pawn Stars, on the other hand, is an American reality television series produced by Leftfield Pictures for the History channel. The show primarily documents the daily activities of the Harrison family-run pawn shop called the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The cast – Rick Harrison, Corey \\"Big Hoss\\" Harrison, Richard \\"Old Man\\" Harrison, and Austin \\"Chumlee\\" Russell – help showcase real-life encounters with customers and provide historical information about the items brought to the store for pawning or selling. Pawn Stars first premiered on July 19, 2009, and continues to be a popular series on the History channel. Now, comparing the premiere dates of both shows, it is clear that Pawn Stars aired first on July 19, 2009, while Auction Kings began airing on October 26, 2010. Therefore, Pawn Stars is the series that aired first between the two. The success and longevity of Pawn Stars have made it a staple in modern reality television and have inspired similar shows, such as Auction Kings, which followed in its footsteps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tweet starts with \\"Ok, friends in the area,\\" indicating an informal tone and a message directed towards friends, likely on a platform like Twitter. 2. The author mentions that they \\"don't live with a parent,\\" providing context for the reader that the author is possibly an adult or someone who does not have immediate family nearby. 3. The following part, \\"for the sake of my (currently non-existent) sex life,\\" expresses a personal issue or desire that the author is discussing with friends. The tone is humorous and light-hearted, as the author uses self-deprecating humor to discuss their personal life. 4. The message culminates in the request, \\"can I pleease use your place?\\" In this context, the author is asking a favor from friends, using an informal and slightly pleading tone. Based on this analysis, I would classify the sentiment of this tweet as predominantly lighthearted and humorous with a hint of desperation. The tone is informal and casual, as the author is speaking with close friends about their personal life. It is important to note that the author's use of humor and self-deprecation results in this tweet not being overly negative or depressive. Instead, it creates a sense of camaraderie among friends, opening up a conversation for solutions while maintaining a light and easy-going atmosphere.

Problem:Passage: Efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child. Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child. The policy itself, its social impacts, and the effectiveness of limiting overall population growth are controversial. In spite of population control policies, the human population continues to grow. At some point the food supply may run out because of the subsequent need to produce more and more food to feed our population. The United Nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6 billion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100. There is no way to know whether human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted. Another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However, these treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development. Furthermore, the role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed countries, including the United States.

As the two friends left their respective massage parlors, they couldn't wait to discuss their experiences. Step 1: Establish the conversation between Neil and William and their experiences.  Neil proudly boasted about his relaxing and rejuvenating massage, going into detail about the calming atmosphere, the skilled hands of his masseuse, and the quality of the essential oils used during the session. William, on the other hand, couldn't help but express his disappointment with his own experience. He described the noisy ambiance, the untrained masseuse who applied too much pressure at certain points, and the substandard oils that left his skin feeling greasy. Step 2: Explore the consequences of their choices. As the two friends continued to share their experiences, they started to see how their choices had greatly influenced the outcome of their massages. Neil appreciated the fact that his decision to invest in a highly rated spa came with a higher price tag but ultimately delivered a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

Despite their starkly different experiences, both Neil and William were able to learn some valuable life lessons from their respective choices. Neil realized that sometimes paying a little more for a quality service can translate to a significantly more satisfying experience, and the value derived can far outweigh the additional expense.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: “India is OUR country” The quote we often preach but forget to deliver. I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian? Are we pointing fingers at ourselves? In the end, we are all in the same team. Question: What is probably true about the man's actions? Options:  A. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of it  B. His discretionary efforts that brought a change  C. not enough information  D. He just turned around Answer:","output":"B.

Read this: Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days), windiest (24.3 km/h (15.1 mph) average speed), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain (called \\"silver thaws\\"), the worst of which paralyzed the city over a three-day period in April 1984.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population.

It would increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"If Jim were to increase the weight of the vehicle, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle would generally decrease. This is because a heavier vehicle requires more energy (and therefore more fuel) to overcome inertia, accelerate, and maintain speed.  Greater weight means a higher amount of mechanical effort is required to move the car, making the engine work harder and thereby consume more fuel. Moreover, a heavier vehicle generates more rolling resistance in the tires and larger air resistance, both of which contribute to increased fuel consumption.  Therefore, when designing a new car, it is essential to find a balance between necessary structural integrity, safety, and using lightweight materials to reduce the overall weight for better fuel efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a heavy equipment training school at Piper, which is still in operation.In 1992 the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections opened the Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp at Piper as the state's \\"first military-style motivational boot camp\\". The minimum security program for non-violent, first-time offenders has accepted both male and female inmates from the start. Originally designed to house 200, the Department of Corrections expanded the facility in the late 1990s to a capacity of 500 on about 50 acres (20 ha).

Hana, a rare Sumatran tiger, had given birth to three cubs on Nov. 17, and though one hadn't made it long past the birth, the other two seemed to be thriving and bonding with their mother, the Times of Israel reports. That's why zookeepers were horrified to find the 5-week-old cubs were missing on Friday; they determined that Hana had killed and eaten them. \\"We discovered they had been killed when we went to weigh them,\\" Nili Avni-Magen, the zoo's chief vet, tells AFP. Although the Times notes that both wild tigers and those in captivity will eat their young if they're stressed, hungry, or looking to mate, the tragedy was unexpected. \\"This was a complete surprise,\\" Avni-Magen tells Haaretz. \\"We truly thought we were beyond this and that she was on the right path.\\" And a tragedy it is, since there are believed to be fewer than 400 of the critically endangered tigers left in the wild in Sumatra, the World Wildlife Fund notes. Various conservation programs have enjoyed success at upping the tigers' population: Around 261 of these tigers now exist in zoos thanks to captive-breeding programs, up from 180 in 2008, AFP reports; 32 were born just this year in captivity. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, which showcases animals featured in the Hebrew Bible, has an especially impressive mating record in terms of endangered species, per AFP. Although Avni-Magen says the news \\"is disappointing and very, very sad,\\" the zoo \\"will learn the lessons. It could be that this is connected to the behavior of the male.\\" (Read how a med student saved this tiger cub's life.) Article:","output":"Once upon a time, in a zoo far away in a place named Jerusalem, a mommy tiger named Hana had three cute baby tigers. This was big news because Hana is a special Sumatran tiger. There are not many like her left in the world, only about 400, like counting all your fingers and toes twenty times! But then, something very sad happened. After only five weeks, two of the baby tigers were not there anymore. The zookeepers looked everywhere but couldn't find them. Then they found out that Hana, their mommy, had eaten them. You might ask - why would a mommy eat her own babies? Well sometimes, wild animals like tigers do this if they're too stressed, hungry, or want to have more babies. Think of it like when you're very scared or anxious, or very very hungry, you might do things that you normally wouldn't, right? It's similar for tigers too. The zookeepers were really surprised because they thought Hana was happy and safe, and that she wouldn't do anything to harm her babies. They were very, very sad about it. And it was a big loss because we have to protect the Sumatran tigers - they are very important and special animals.  But don't worry, even though this is very sad news, there is also good news. More and more baby Sumatran tigers are being born in zoos to keep them safe from danger in the wild and increase their population. In 2008, there were 180 tigers like Hana in zoos, but now, there are 261! That's an increase of 81 tigers - can you imagine a group of 81 tigers? Almost enough to fill up your whole kindergarten, right?! And the zookeepers in Jerusalem are very good at helping tigers like Hana have babies. Even though they are very sad about what happened, they are ready to learn from this and help Hana feel safe and happy again. They believe it could have something to do with the daddy tiger's behavior. So, even though something very sad happened to Hana and her babies, remember that the story is not over. The zookeepers are doing everything they can to help Hana, and they will keep working hard to protect all the Sumatran tigers around the world.

Choose your answer: If \\"A boy surfs on a wave.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person in the water.\\"? Available choices: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","output":"(a). Yes This is because the phrase \\"A boy surfs on a wave\\" provides enough information to imply that \\"A person is in the water.\\" The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: First, by definition, a boy is a young male human, which makes him a person. This satisfies the \\"person\\" aspect indicated in the second phrase. Next, the action in the first phrase is \\"surfs on a wave.\\" Surfing by nature is a water-based activity. It requires one to be on a surfboard riding moving waves typically in the ocean, which obligatorily puts the person doing this action, in this case the boy, in the water. This means he is either directly contacting the water or at the very least is immediately above the water's surface at the time of surfing.  Therefore, the interaction that a surfer has with the wave and subsequently the inherent water environment during the process of surfing can lead us to logically conceive that \\"A person is in the water,\\" such that we could clarify it as \\"A person is in or on the water.\\"  Hence, given the information provided in the initial phrase \\"A boy surfs on a wave\\", it logically follows that \\"A person is in the water.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","output":"The full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I can be deduced through the information provided in the context. The information given states that Mary of Burgundy was the granddaughter of Philip the Good and was married to Maximilian I. Therefore, we can infer that the grandfather in question is Philip the Good. Philip the Good, also known as Philip III, was the Duke of Burgundy from 1419 to his death in 1467. His full name was Philip III of Burgundy, or in French, Philippe III le Bon, and he was a member of the Valois-Burgundy dynasty. He was an influential patron of the arts and played a significant role in the development and growth of the Netherlandish illumination industry, which dominated Europe for several generations. His extensive collection of illuminated books served as the foundation for the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library, and his patronage and support continued through his descendants, including Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian I."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - Prudential Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the central business district of Newark, New Jersey, United States.

Geological history of Earth During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\\"continental climate\\") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Q: During which period was the Tehtys Ocean dominant?","output":"The Tethys Ocean was dominant during the Mesozoic Era, which spanned from approximately 252 million years ago to around 66 million years ago. This era was further divided into three periods: the Triassic (252-201 million years ago), Jurassic (201-145 million years ago), and Cretaceous (145-66 million years ago) periods. The Tethys Ocean played a significant role in shaping the Earth's geological history, influencing the climate, ocean currents, and the formation and distribution of continents during the Mesozoic Era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The \\"now\\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier.  Unfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience.

If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community. Hang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.  _ .

New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling  passengers on those blue Citi Bikes. But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted   . While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks agreed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City. Question: What is the author's chief concern about the increasing use of Citi Bikes in New York? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Whether local bike shops will suffer.\\"?

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. In early 2014 Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of \\"hate speech\\". University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that \\"certain of her past statements\\" were inconsistent with the university's \\"core values\\" because they were \\"Islamophobic.\\" Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future.  The university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, The Economist noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's \\"Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics.\\" It said that \\"The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious...\\" The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree.  A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the \\"spirit of free expression\\" has been betrayed and stifled.  David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence.  Among the commenters, Jeffrey Herf, a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had \\"done deep and long-lasting damage to a university.\\" Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Lawrence \\"succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why did they rescind?","output":"Brandeis University rescinded its offer to give Ayaan Hirsi Ali an honorary degree because, according to University President Frederick M.

She was famous for being on a TV show called \\"The Bachelor\\" where she tried to find love. Gia had a boyfriend named Ryan Anderson, who played basketball with a big team called the New Orleans Pelicans. One sad day, Gia was feeling very very sad and didn't know how to make her heart feel better. She decided to do something called \\"suicide,\\" which means taking her own life. This made everyone who loved her very sad, especially her boyfriend, Ryan. After some time, Ryan wanted to talk about Gia and about suicide so that people could learn from her story. It was important for him to share what happened so that others could understand what suicide is and how to not let it happen. He wanted to help others not feel so sad and lost. Ryan talked about how he didn't understand why Gia was so sad and lost, and how he would do anything to help her if he could turn back time. He wanted everyone to know that it's important to be there for the people you love. If you see someone who is feeling sad, don't be afraid to talk to them and help them feel better. Sometimes all someone needs to feel better is a good friend who really cares. Remember, if you ever feel very very sad, don't keep it inside.

Most fake oakley sunglasses don't come with proper documentation. The certificate of authenticity and the warranty card should be the first two things you should look into when purchasing a pair of designer sunglasses. Pick from:  (A). Look for the iphone logo on the inside of each of the lenses. Fake oakley sunglasses have a large plastic logo affixed to the front.  (B). Examine the lenses of the sunglasses for clarity and design. Carefully inspect your goggles to see if they are deeply tinted and have clear contact lenses.  (C). Avoid go for quality sunglasses that are made out of gold, bronze, or other metallic materials.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Before a storm, ants will build up their mounds and create steep sides. If you see raised ant beds, especially if they were lower before, then there may be a storm coming. When the air pressure falls before a storm, birds feel discomfort in their ears. This causes them to fly lower toward the ground or to perch on lower tree branches or power lines. You may also observe the birds eating ground insects. This behavior suggests that a storm is coming.  If the birds are flying high in the sky, then there will likely be fair weather. If you’re near the sea, look for seagulls perched on the beach, which could indicate that a storm is coming. Watch for large groups of roosting birds. Birds also become quiet before a storm. Singing and chirping birds could indicate good weather. Birds can sense air pressure and will time their migrations to good weather. If you see flocks of birds migrating in the sky, then the weather will likely be good that day. If a storm is going to be short, birds will usually wait for the rain to end before looking for food. If you see birds eating during a storm, then it will likely last for a long time. Birds can sense the pressure patterns, allowing them to predict the weather. Bees and butterflies return to their homes before a storm for safety. In the case of bees, they also work to preserve the hive. If you don’t see any bees and butterflies when you would expect to - such as in a field of flowers - then there may be a storm coming. Cows usually gather together and lie down in their pasture before a rainstorm. This is likely because it cools down before a storm, and cows like to be close to the ground when the weather cools. Cows lying on the ground is an indication that it may rain. This only applies to cows, not other livestock. Snakes will leave their nests before bad weather, even if it’s in the middle of wintertime. Seeing snakes in unexpected places or at a time when the snake would normally be in its nest can be a sign of bad weather.  Snakes can even predict earthquakes. If you see a snake out of its nest behaving erratically, there could be an earthquake coming.  Snakes usually come out of their nests in sunny weather to warm themselves. They don't like the cold because they are cold-blooded. A snake out of its nest when it's not a warm, sunny day is an indication that bad weather is coming. Tortoises will seek higher ground before a storm, so look for movement to higher locations. You may see them in the road one to two days before a rain. Summary:","output":"Animals like ants, birds, bees, butterflies, cows, snakes, and tortoises can sometimes predict and react to upcoming storms or bad weather, so if you see them acting differently, it might mean a storm is coming."},{"instruction":"Given the below context:  Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish.

Write a title for this article: By MICHAEL FALCONE (@michaelpfalcone) and AMY WALTER (@amyewalter) ‘Twas the Friday after Christmas and all through Washington not a deal was stirring, not even at the White House? With the center of gravity in the fiscal cliff negotiations shifting to the Senate and to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, lawmakers and President Obama will try to break the stalemate today at 3 p.m. ET when President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden sit down with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. There are now just four days to go before the country falls off the cliff, and as ABC’s Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl noted on “Good Morning America” today, this is actually the very first meeting all sides have had together in six weeks. The last time this group met was Nov. 16. http://abcn.ws/VGsGrV That may be hard to believe, but it’s not really that surprising when you listen to the rhetoric coming from both Senate leaders. “Republicans aren’t about to write a blank check for anything Senate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves as the edge of the cliff,” McConnell said on the Senate floor yesterday. Meanwhile, Reid likened Speaker Boehner’s leadership in the House to a “dictatorship” that was preventing “the vast majority of the House of Representatives to get what they want.” Most Capitol Hill insiders agree that the we probably go off the fiscal cliff — at least for a little while — with a real deal to come in January after the new Congress is sworn in, but there may be another option on the table. The two sides could come together to support what Karl described as a “small deal that would at least prevent these tax increases from going into effect for most people.” Chances of that happening? Jon Karl puts them at three to five percent. Not exactly a glass-half-full scenario. ABC’S AMY WALTER: Perhaps it’s because I’m a parent to a six-year-old, but the only way to make sense of the fiscal cliff shenanigans is to put it in child rearing terms. If there is no consequence for bad behavior, then the bad behavior will continue. Think how many times you have heard (or said) “if you don’t stop this right now then X will happen.” When X doesn’t happen (the car doesn’t pull over, dessert is still served etc), the child learns that he or she can indeed get away with breaking the rules. In Washington, the only real consequence is losing an election. And, since both sides believe they won in 2012 (Democrats held the White House and Senate despite high unemployment; Republicans held the House despite sky-high disapproval ratings), neither side sees a real downside to letting the country fall off the fiscal cliff. A frustrated public, a declining Dow — these are not the consequences that will spur either side to action. It’s only when defeat, real lasting defeat is felt, that compromise will happen. with ABC’s Elizabeth Hartfield (@LizHartfield) NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF, GULF WAR COMMANDER, DIES AT 78. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the retired general credited with leading U.S.-allied forces to a victory in the first Gulf War, died Thursday. He was 78 years old. ABC’s Michael James reports, Schwarzkopf, called “Stormin’ Norman” because of his reportedly explosive temper, actually led Republican administrations to two military victories: a small one in Grenada in the 1980s and a big one as de facto commander of allied forces in the Gulf War in 1991. “‘Stormin’ Norman’ led the coalition forces to victory, ejecting the Iraqi Army from Kuwait and restoring the rightful government,” read a statement by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War. “His leadership not only inspired his troops, but also inspired the nation.” http://abcn.ws/12Sy0ii WHITE HOUSE LASHES OUT AT ‘CONGRESSIONAL STUPIDITY.’ With only days to come up with a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, the White House said “congressional stupidity” was damaging the economy but that an agreement could be reached if Republican leaders don’t get in the way. ABC’s Sarah Parnass, John Parkinson and Reena Ninan report, while Boehner has put the onus on the president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a White House official used testy language to put the responsibility back on Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “What we need is for the Senate Minority Leader not to block a vote and for Boehner to allow a vote,” a White House official told ABC News. “The hits to our economy aren’t coming from outside factors, they’re coming from congressional stupidity.” http://abcn.ws/12FUTWY BUSH 41 GETTING EXCELLENT TREATMENT. The AP’s Michael Graczyk reports, “Former President George H.W. Bush, who has been hospitalized for more than a month, is getting excellent medical treatment and would advise people to ‘put the harps back in the closet,’ his longtime Houston chief of staff said Thursday evening. But Jean Becker also pointed out in her statement that the 88-year-old Bush is sick and likely will be in the hospital for a while after a ‘terrible case of bronchitis which then triggered a series of complications.’” http://abcn.ws/12SyEfB ED MARKEY DECLARES CANDIDACY IN SENATE SPECIAL. The Boston Globe’s Mark Arsenault reports, “US Representative Edward J. Markey, dean of the state’s Washington delegation, will run in 2013 for the Senate seat expected to open with the nomination of Senator John F. ­Kerry to head the State Department. Markey, 66, a Malden Democrat elected to the House in 1976, is the first prominent candidate to ­declare a run for Kerry’s seat, which will be filled through a special election early next summer, probably in June. Kerry, a Democrat and head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate in coming weeks as the next secretary of state.” http://bo.st/UvYmEP SENATORS CHAFE AT INACTION OVER FISCAL CLIFF DEAL. The New York Times Jennifer Steinhauer reports, “Senators bid hasty goodbyes to families, donned ties and pantsuits in lieu of sweat pants and Christmas sweaters and one by one returned to the Capitol on Thursday to begin the business of doing nothing in particular. But for once, those lawmakers were fully united, if only around their sadness and frustration at being stuck in Washington in a holiday week, peering over the edge of the fiscal abyss. Not to be outdone, Speaker John A. Boehner, who failed last week to cobble together enough votes for his own bill, ordered House members to return on Sunday.” http://nyti.ms/VloqCm EXPERTS: TRAINED POLICE NEEDED FOR SCHOOL SECURITY. The AP’s Larry Margasak reports, “the student’s attack began with a shotgun blast through the windows of a California high school. Rich Agundez, the El Cajon policeman assigned to the school, felt his mind shift into overdrive. While two teachers and three students were injured when the glass shattered in the 2001 attack on Granite Hills High School, Agundez confronted the assailant and wounded him before he could get inside the school and use his second weapon, a handgun. The National Rifle Association’s response to a Connecticut school massacre envisions, in part, having trained, armed volunteers in every school in America. But Agundez, school safety experts and school board members say there’s a huge difference between a trained law enforcement officer who becomes part of the school family – and a guard with a gun.” http://apne.ws/VaJgSq HAWAII’S BRIAN SCHATZ SWORN INTO SENATE. Politico’s Seung Min Kim reports, “Hawaii Lt. Gov. Brian Schatz was sworn in to the Senate Thursday afternoon to replace Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who died last week of respiratory complications. ‘I was pleased to have my family here with me,’ Schatz said in brief comments after he was sworn in. ‘And of course, we’re hopeful to get right to work on averting the fiscal cliff.’ Despite his relative youth — he’s 40 — and just being sworn in, Schatz will be Hawaii’s senior senator. Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) is retiring and will be replaced by Rep. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who is set to be sworn in next week when the 113th Congress begins.” http://politi.co/Uw3VTO BUDGET WRITERS AT PENTAGON MOVE FORWARD DESPITE SPENDING THREAT. The Hill’s Carlo Munoz reports, “The Pentagon is pretending the threat of the “fiscal cliff” doesn’t exist when it comes to the Defense Department’s 2014 budget. Budget planners are preparing their 2014 budget as if lawmakers will avoid the spending cuts known as sequestration that are scheduled to hit the Pentagon in January.” http://bit.ly/WMJUHf –OP-ED: THE SENATE SHOULD BLOCK AN END RUN ON NUCLEAR ARMS. John Bolton and John Yoo penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for the senate to block an end run on nuclear arms. “President Obama has made eliminating all nuclear weapons his signature policy. In 2011, his New Start Treaty committed the United States to a ceiling of 700 strategic delivery vehicles and 1,550 strategic warheads,” Bolton and Yoo write. “Now, as he promised in March, he seeks even deeper reductions through “a step we have never taken before—reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve.” But the president faces the Constitution’s requirement that two-thirds of the Senate consent to any treaty. In 2010, the Senate ratified New Start with a vote of 71-26, but only after ending a filibuster with the exact 67 votes needed for a treaty. After his nasty re-election campaign, partisan budget wrangling and unfulfilled promises to modernize our nuclear stockpile, Mr. Obama will have a hard time finding 12 Republican senators to support any new nuclear deal with Russia. Senators should block end-runs around the Constitution’s treaty clause.” http://on.wsj.com/THJsg5 @politicalwire: Why neither side wants a fiscal cliff dealhttp://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/12/28/why_they_want_to_go_over_the_fiscal_cliff.html … @ChadPergram: Republican Study Cmte Chair Jim Jordan: Sen Reid and his colleagues should accept the House-passed plan or approve an acceptable alternative @markknoller: No one holds out much hope the group can reach a deal to avert the fiscal cliff on Tuesday, but stranger things have happened. @thegarance: “what on earth is Washington doing setting cat policy — polydactyl or otherwise — for Key West, Fla.?” http://trib.in/Tudqk7 @jackshafer: But consider the upside.

Regarding your second question, if you remove or delete your Gmail account from one device, your emails will still be accessible on other devices where the account is still active. This is because your emails are stored in the Gmail servers, not on the device itself. If you remove a Gmail account from a device, you are just stopping that device's access to the account, while the emails and account information continue to be available on other devices and online using a browser by logging into Gmail. To answer your last question, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first one asks about the removal of a Gmail account from a device, while the second one asks whether your emails are still present on other devices after removing an account from one device. The first question is about the process of removing an account, and the second question is related to the accessibility of emails after removing the Gmail account from a device."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available choices:  (A). yes.  (B). it is not possible to tell.  (C). no.","output":"(C). no. Based on the given information, it cannot be concluded that \\"The boys are watching tv.\\" The description provided details a scene in which two young men are handling an orange outboard boat, presumably lifting it either into or out of the water, with visible whitecap waves present. The natural setting and physical activity being performed by the two young men directly contradicts the idea of them watching television. Television watching typically takes place indoors or in a more passive, stationary environment. In contrast, the scenario described involves an outdoor activity that requires strength, focus, and coordination. The young men are engaged in a task related to boating, which does not resemble a passive recreational activity such as watching television. Based on the information provided, we can reasonably conclude that the boys are not watching television in this particular scenario. Instead, they are actively participating in handling an outboard boat, which is a different kind of activity from sitting in front of a screen. The presence of whitecap waves also emphasizes the distinctness of the setting, further reinforcing that the boys are not involved in television watching at that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The review mentions that the film is a \\"fanciful horror flick\\" which might suggest some level of appreciation. 2.

So she decided not to add any sugar. The hot cocoa tasted boring. OPT: a). Being healthy isn't always fun.; b). She loved the donut she was eating.;","output":"a). Being healthy isn't always fun. It was a cold winter evening. Snow fell gently onto the ground outside, covering the desolate landscape in a pristine white sheet. Lexi had loved winter for as long as she could remember. She mostly enjoyed indulging in her favorite activities – hot cocoa and curling up with a blanket in front of the fireplace. But this year was different. Lexi had made a resolution to be healthier. It had been a challenging year for her, filled with stress, tempting fast food, and skipped workouts. She knew she needed to make a change for the sake of her body and mind. But she also knew that changing habits was not going to be an easy ride. One of the hardest things to let go of was her undying love for sugary treats, such as her all-time winter comfort – hot cocoa. This evening, Lexi found herself craving that rich and sweet concoction she had always adored. She knew she could not stop herself altogether from having it, but she was determined to modify the recipe to make it healthier. To do so, she decided not to add any sugar. As she stirred her cocoa concoction on the stove, she felt a pang of sadness at the thought of omitting the sweet ingredient that she was sure would transform the otherwise mundane liquid into a delightful and warming treat. But she had vowed to keep her resolution. With a deep breath, Lexi poured herself a steaming mug of unsweetened cocoa. The anticipation was palpable as Lexi took her first sip. Her taste buds were met with a strong and bitter taste, completely devoid of the sweetness she had been accustomed to. Her heart sank, and she realized being healthy wasn't always fun. Despite the bitterness of her first sip, Lexi knew she needed to give it a chance. Over time, as she continued to drink the healthier version of her beloved hot cocoa, she noticed that her taste buds began to adjust. The bitterness transformed into a rich chocolate-y flavor that she started to appreciate. One day, complex layers of cocoa flavor seemed to reveal themselves to her as if they were always hidden beneath the sticky sweetness that she once craved. Lexi found her palate opening up to a whole new world of flavors that she had never experienced before. Lexi's journey to living a healthier lifestyle was not easy, as she had to battle with temptation and make tough choices. However, the newfound appreciation for healthier options made her realize that although being healthy isn't always fun, the payoff is worth it. As she persevered and continued incorporating healthier choices into her life, Lexi found herself feeling stronger, more energetic, and happier than ever. The self-discipline required to make these changes bled into other aspects of her life, leading her to develop an inner strength that she never knew she had. The winter evenings continued to be filled with warmth and comfort, but instead of indulging in unhealthy treats, Lexi learned to find enjoyment in the simple pleasures of life that supported her well-being. This newfound resilience allowed her to approach future winters - and life - with a sense of optimism and confidence that she could face any hurdle and come out stronger on the other side. And while she never lost her love for sweet treats, she also never forgot the lesson she learned about the importance of balance and self-discipline on her journey to a healthier, happier life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea., what would be the answer ?

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences present distinct information about the status of schools and their operation. In the first sentence, the speaker is conveying that \\"all schools were closed for almost, for over or for a week,\\" which means that schools were not operating during that time, presumably due to an unspecified event or circumstance. On the other hand, the second sentence states that \\"They decided that lessons should continue as per normal in schools.\\" This sentence implies that a decision was made to resume regular school activities and lessons, possibly after an interruption or change in operations. However, this sentence does not indicate whether that decision was made before, during, or after the timeframe mentioned in the first sentence. It is important to note that the first sentence is filled with filler words such as \\"um\\" and repetitions of ‘for’ which makes it less concise, while the second sentence is more straightforward and clear in its message. Nevertheless, the fundamental point remains that these two sentences do not entail each other, as they convey different information about the status of schools and their operations.

The task requires rounding each integer in the given list to the nearest tens place (nearest multiple of 10). Here's the solution for the given instance: 1. Start with the first integer, -224. 2. Determine the nearest multiple of 10. Since -224 is closer to -220 than -230, -220 is the nearest multiple of 10. So, round -224 to -220. 3. Continue with the next integer, 481. 4. Determine the nearest multiple of 10. Since 481 is closer to 480 than 490, 480 is the nearest multiple of 10. So, round 481 to 480. 5. Repeat the process for the remaining integers:    - 211 is closer to 210 than 220. So, round 211 to 210.    - 115 is closer to 120 than 110. So, round 115 to 120.    - 210 is already a multiple of 10, so no rounding is needed.    - 384 is closer to 380 than 390. So, round 384 to 380.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Though you may feel that you have done nothing wrong, determine if there is anything at all that you can improve on.  You might yell at her sometimes or rarely clean up after yourself. Though you can’t control your mom, you can control yourself and work to minimize the issues you have with her. Domineering mothers often have a hard time letting go of control of their children and letting them be adults. Show your mother that you are responsible so that she feels comfortable letting you make your own decisions. Complete your chores, take on more responsibilities in the home, and keep your promises to your parents. Your mom’s control might stem from simply trying to be involved in your life.  Though she displays this desire in an unhealthy way, try to find a way to let her in. See if she’ll let you stay out later on Saturday night if you do more chores that morning. If she is nervous about you going away to college, set up a communication plan and safety plan so she feels more secure. Your mom might be so domineering that you feel scared around her at times.  However, begin to establish assertiveness in small ways.  Look her in the eyes during conversations. Speak up, keep your voice strong and steady, and hold your head high. Your mom’s control over you is probably so frustrating at times that you want to scream.  Instead of lashing out at her or others, find a more productive way to channel your anger.  Take up a hobby like painting, drawing, or writing poems. Sit in a hot bath to soothe yourself or meditate. You can also vent to someone you trust. Perhaps your dad, second mom, step parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent is far less domineering than your mother.  Sit down and have a talk with them to see if they can help you or give advice.  They might be able to talk to your mom for you or have a tip on how to deal with her. Pull them aside and say something like, “Hey Dad, I’m not trying to go behind Mom’s back or anything, but I’m starting to feel smothered.  She won’t even let me close my bedroom door to do homework.  Do you have any advice or can you talk to her for me?” Summary:","output":"Examine your own actions and behaviors to identify areas of improvement when dealing with a domineering mother.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Paleobotanist How organisms acquired traits that allow them to colonize new environments—and how the contemporary ecosystem is shaped—are fundamental questions of evolution. Paleobotany (the study of extinct plants) addresses these questions through the analysis of fossilized specimens retrieved from field studies, reconstituting the morphology of organisms that disappeared long ago. Paleobotanists trace the evolution of plants by following the modifications in plant morphology: shedding light on the connection between existing plants by identifying common ancestors that display the same traits. This field seeks to find transitional species that bridge gaps in the path to the development of modern organisms. Fossils are formed when organisms are trapped in sediments or environments where their shapes are preserved. Paleobotanists collect fossil specimens in the field and place them in the context of the geological sediments and other fossilized organisms surrounding them. The activity requires great care to preserve the integrity of the delicate fossils and the layers of rock in which they are found. One of the most exciting recent developments in paleobotany is the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology to study fossils. Preservation of molecular structures requires an environment free of oxygen, since oxidation and degradation of material through the activity of microorganisms depend on its presence. One example of the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology is the identification of oleanane, a compound that deters pests. Up to this point, oleanane appeared to be unique to flowering plants; however, it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the Permian, much earlier than the current dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants. Paleobotanists can also study fossil DNA, which can yield a large amount of information, by analyzing and comparing the DNA sequences of extinct plants with those of living and related organisms. Through this analysis, evolutionary...   Q: What is paleobotany?   A: Choose your answer from: * study of diseased plants. * study of new plants. * study of fresh plants. * study of extinct plants.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Why did the twins sell the house?  A. It was too large for the two of them.  B. Neither wanted to set a foot it in again.  C. So they could invest in other real estate.

To protect  the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing   free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag. What kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas. Recently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags. Most students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them. But Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material  . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, \\"No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,\\" he said. \\"It's strong enough!\\" Chen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved   a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job.

Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart.

How many more millions did the U.S increased their military aid package in 2009 compared to 2006?","output":"The U.S. increased their military aid package to Yemen significantly between 2006 and 2009. In 2006, the aid package was less than 11 million. By 2009, the aid had increased to more than 70 million. To determine the increase in millions, we can subtract the 2006 value from the 2009 value: 70 million (2009) - 11 million (2006) = 59 million Therefore, the U.S. increased their military aid package to Yemen by approximately 59 million between 2006 and 2009. This increase was aimed at supporting Yemeni counter-terrorism efforts in their fight against al-Qaeda militants who had a strong presence in the country.

The Gale V team won the National High Point Championship in 1954 and 1955 and won the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup in 1955 with Lee Schoenith driving. The boat was retired after the 1955 season. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Gold Cup is just a name, it is actually made from silver.","output":"While it is true that the Gale V won the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup in 1955 with Lee Schoenith as the driver, the conclusion that the Gold Cup is just a name and is actually made from silver cannot be accurately drawn based solely on the information provided about the Gale V and its racing successes. To draw conclusions about the Gold Cup itself, a more informative approach would be to study its history, meaning, and importance within the sport. The Gold Cup, originally known as the Challenge Cup, is an American motorboat racing trophy, first awarded in 1904. It is one of the oldest active motor sports trophies in the world and serves as the premier event for unlimited hydroplane racing. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) organizes the Gold Cup races, and the event has been held every year, except during World War II and other breaks due to various reasons. The name \\"Gold Cup\\" is derived from the trophy's appearance, which is a magnificent, 2.5-foot tall, 30-pound artistic masterpiece made of solid gold. The cup features intricate detailing, which includes a flared bowl on top, supported by an elongated stem with three winged female figures, and a base with cast relief plaques depicting various watercraft. The award has undergone some modifications over the years, but the gold material has remained consistent throughout its history. Contrary to the assumption that the Gold Cup is made of silver, the trophy is indeed crafted using gold. The connection between the Gale V hydroplane team's accomplishments and the Gold Cup's composition does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the cup is made of silver. In conclusion, while the Gale V did have significant achievements in the 1950s, it is essential to look into the history and background of the Gold Cup itself to understand its significance and true composition. The Gold Cup has been and continues to be an esteemed award in the world of motorboat racing, made of gold, and not silver, honoring the champions who take part in this prestigious event."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What type of spouses do Haredi normally have?\\" is in \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

Available choices:  A). no  B). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing, as they each focus on a different aspect. However, these questions are related since both of them revolve around hiring engineers in Japanese companies. Let's breakdown both questions to understand their differences and connections: Question 1: \\"Do Japanese companies hire mechatronics engineers?\\" This question is specifically asking if Japanese companies employ individuals skilled in mechatronics engineering. Mechatronics engineering deals with the integration of mechanical, electrical, control, and software engineering in the design and manufacture of intelligent systems and products. Japanese companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Panasonic are known for their involvement in automation and robotics, which often require mechatronics engineers. So, the answer to this question is B). yes. Question 2: \\"Do Japanese companies hire Indian engineers?\\" This question is about the recruitment of Indian engineers by Japanese companies, regardless of their engineering specialization. It focuses on nationality rather than a specific field of engineering. Japanese companies are increasingly collaborating with Indian engineers, both in India and Japan. Companies such as Honda, Sony, Toshiba, and TCS Japan have employed Indian engineers to leverage their expertise in various fields, including software development, automobile, and electronics. Thus, the answer to this question is B). yes. In summary, both questions address different aspects of Japanese companies' hiring practices. The first question is specific to the employment of mechatronics engineers, while the second question involves the hiring of Indian engineers, regardless of their field of specialization. Nonetheless, the answers to both questions are positive, indicating that Japanese companies do hire mechatronics engineers, and they also recruit Indian engineers in various engineering domains."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: I am an Indian guy. I send friend requests to many girls having mutual friends. Why don't they accept the request? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1: The maximum limit of friends on Facebook for a regular user profile is 5,000. After reaching this number, a person cannot accept more friend requests. When you send a friend request to someone who has reached this limit, you will receive the message \\"This person has reached the friend request limit and can't accept any more\\" because that person cannot add you as a friend until they remove some existing friends to make space. This friend limit is set by Facebook to prevent users from creating networks that are too large to be manageable and also to maintain a more genuine social experience that focuses on real relationships rather than just amassing a huge number of contacts. The main reasons for establishing such a limit include: 1. Performance: Managing updates, notifications, and processing data for a large number of friends can be resource-intensive for both Facebook’s servers and the user’s device. By limiting the number of friends, Facebook ensures that the user experience remains smooth and optimal. 2. Privacy: A vast network can expose a user's personal information to more people, increasing the risk of misuse or unintentional breaches of privacy. Limiting the number of friends helps users maintain a reasonable level of control over their personal information. 3. Authenticity: A high friend limit can lead to a superficial social network with less meaningful connections. By imposing a friend limit, Facebook tries to encourage users to create more sincere connections with people they genuinely know and care about. Answer to Question 2: Receiving friend requests and accepting them is a personal choice of the person one sends a request to. Although many girls may share mutual friends with you, they may not accept the requests for several reasons, some of which include: 1. Familiarity: Most people prefer to add friends they know well or have interacted with before. If they haven't met you or don't know you well, they may choose not to accept the request. 2. Privacy concerns: Many individuals are concerned about their online privacy and might only add friends they trust, even if there are mutual connections. 3. Profile authenticity: If your profile appears incomplete or lacks authenticity, with limited pictures or information, they might be hesitant to accept your friend request. 4. Personal preferences: Different people have different preferences for adding friends, and some individuals might be selective regarding who they add. It's essential not to take it personally if someone doesn't accept your friend request. It's important to respect their decision and focus on building genuine connections with those who do accept the request. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Question 1 deals with Facebook's technical limitation of a maximum number of friends, while Question 2 deals with the personal preferences and choices of the individuals receiving friend requests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Intensive Israeli shelling killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 150 in southern Gaza today, medics said, shattering the fragile truce . But Israeli Defence Force troops are now frantically searching for an army officer believed kidnapped in a Hamas ambush that involved gunmen and suicide bombers that reportedly burst from concealed tunnels. The IDF has confirmed two soldiers were killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip today while Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23, is believed captured. \\"Initial indications suggest that a soldier has been abducted by terrorists in an incident where terrorists breached the ceasefire,\\" IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said. A Palestinian health worker helps an injured child following the latest Israeli assault in Gaza (Getty Images) Asked if that meant the truce was over he replied: \\"Yes. We are continuing our activities on the ground.\\" He said the officer, believed to be from the Givati Brigade, was snatched by militants who emerged from concealed tunnels. One militant is reported to have detonated his suicide vest during the attack. He said the clash took place in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where an AFP correspondent earlier reported fierce fighting as the army warned residents by telephone to stay in their houses as it \\"pursued terrorist elements.\\" The Times of Israel has reported that the kidnapped IDF member is an officer from the Givati Brigade, an infantry unit with amphibian capabilities that has extensive experience in Gaza operations. An IDF spokesman said earlier on Twitter: \\"We are conducting extensive searches in S. Gaza in order to find a missing IDF soldier. We suspect the soldier was kidnapped by Hamas today”. The renewed fighting, which saw Israel pound Palestinian militants in apparent response to renewed rocket fire, shattered the short-lived cease fire and jeopardises international efforts for a durable ceasefire. The skies over Gaza initially fell silent after the humanitarian truce announced overnight by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the longest of several agreed since the conflict broke out on July 8. It gave a brief respite to people in the battered strip from fighting that has killed nearly 1,500 on the Palestinian side, mostly civilians, and 61 Israeli soldiers and three civilians on the other. But within hours air raid sirens warning of rocket fire were heard on the Israeli side of the border, and heavy artillery shelling renewed in the southern city of Rafah, killing dozens of people and injuring up to 100 more, medics said. Hamas have not confirmed or denied the capture of an IDF soldier but said Israel's announcement of the capture was simply a \\"justification for Israel retreating from the truce, and a cover-up for massacres especially in Rafah,\\" referring to Israeli shelling that killed at least 35 people just hours after the truce took hold. A separate military statement claimed an IDF soldier was captured prior to the 72-hour truce going into effect. Palestinian onlookers and motorists pause to inspect an Israeli army bomb laying unexploded on the road, prior to the truce being broken. (Getty Images) But Hamas said it was Israel which violated the truce. \\"It is the occupation which violated the ceasefire. The Palestinian resistance acted based on... the right to self-defence (and) to stop the massacres of our people,\\" spokesman Fawzi Barhum said in a statement. The United Nations said it was informed by Israel of \\"a serious incident this morning involving a tunnel behind IDF (army) lines in the Rafah area\\". \\"If corroborated, this would constitute a serious violation of the humanitarian ceasefire... by Gazan militant factions, which should be condemned in the strongest terms,\\" the statement said.

It sounds like the perfect living arrangement for cash-strapped students. Two mothers believe they have devised a way for struggling students to save on accommodation costs when they leave home to study at university. Kate Barnham and Amanda Flude have launched Student Swaps, an online accommodation forum   for parents and students, in advance of the introduction in September of PS3,000 higher education top-up fees. Their website says, \\"The principle behind Student Swaps is to enable students to literally swap   family homes.\\" The website will hold a database of students who would like to swap and link them with suitable matches. So those from one town / city could swap with those from a different town / city. The site describes itself as offering a \\"cost-free accommodation alternative... at a time of growing student debt\\". There is no charge for the service at the moment but Ms Barnham and Ms Flude intend to introduce a PS10 annual fee if it becomes established. However, the National Union of Students (NUS) has warned that, while the scheme may sound appealing to struggling freshers, it lacks any formal regulation. Veronica King, NUS vice-president of welfare, said, \\"The fact that this scheme has even been suggested is evidence to the high levels of debt students now face on graduation.\\" Recent research has shown that students are more likely to live at home in coming years, in a bid to cut down on the cost of a degree. \\"This is worrying, as it may mean that students choose their university on the basis of where it is, rather than because it offers the best course for them. It also means students will miss out on what is for some a key part of the student experience-living away from home.\\" Question: Now many students would prefer a university   _  .

Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes.  and a hint : In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.

As they speed across a bridge, the women's car plunges over the side into the river. The police spend three hours dragging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down. In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs in the large house and retreats to her room. Mrs. Thomas, who brings her some food, says she did not pass anyone. Soon, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she simply is not there.

Even though cats aren't known for being the friendliest creatures, often preferring to be by themselves rather than constantly in owners' arms, they should not be constantly trying to get away from people. This can be a sign that they need a reduction in environmental stressors.  If your cat consistently ducks out of the room or dodges behind furniture every time someone enters the room, you should try to figure out what's wrong. New cats may hide more than cats who are accustomed to their homes, so don't be alarmed if your new cat hides for a while after moving in. If you have a cat cohabitating with other pets, it should be easy to tell if aggression is a normal behavior or not. If your cat consistently snaps at or picks fights with animals it used to play happily with, the cat very well may be stressed. Your cat may be sick instead of stressed, so identify any stressors that could be triggering this behavior before heading to the vet. You are also probably attuned to how your cat interacts with other humans. If your cat used to be warm toward people, or even passively accepted their presence, and suddenly starts lashing out, you have a problem. Again, if you are mystified by this aggression, take stock of your home environment and identify any stressors. If there aren't any, the cat may be sick.

Read this article and answer this question The Hotak dynasty  was an Afghan monarchy of the Ghilji Pashtuns, established in April 1709 by Mirwais Hotak after leading a successful revolution against their declining Persian Safavid overlords in the region of Loy Kandahar  in what is now southern Afghanistan. It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it. Hussain Hotak became the last ruler until he was also defeated in 1738. How many years after the Battle of Damghan did Nader Shah defeat Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar?","output":"The Battle of Damghan happened in 1729, and Nader Shah defeated Hussain Hotak in the long siege of Kandahar in 1738. To find out how many years passed between these two events, you can subtract 1729 from 1738. 1738 - 1729 = 9 So, Nader Shah defeated Hussain Hotak 9 years after the Battle of Damghan."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],N={key:0},j={key:1};function q(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
