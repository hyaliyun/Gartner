Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At the beginning, Kaufman's foreign man comes on saying (due to massive editing) it is the end of the film and plays a record alongside the end credits before walking off. Kaufman then comes back on in his normal voice saying he \\"Had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try\\". He then proceeds to show the actual movie on a film projector starting with his childhood home, in Long Island, New York 1957.Flashing forwards to New York City, 1973, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings childrens songs and overuses his \\"foreign man\\" character. Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman. Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy. Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. When Clifton meets Shapiro privately, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and we see that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a villain character created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti), both of whom... Answer:","output":"Movie Title: \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" The movie \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" captures the enigmatic life and career of Andy Kaufman, a comedian and performance artist who consistently and deliberately misled audiences through his unpredictable acts, both on and off stage. Known for his eccentric performance style, Kaufman confounded his fans, critics, and colleagues alike, leaving a lasting impact on the entertainment industry. Set in the 1970s and 1980s, the film takes us on a riveting journey through Kaufman's life, shedding light on his various personas and unconventional methods of entertainment. The story begins with an initial misdirection, as Kaufman's foreign man character announces the end of the film before the movie even starts, foreshadowing that what's about to unfold will continue to deceive and surprise viewers. As Kaufman's career takes off, we witness first-hand the genius and the madness of his myriad creations – from Elvis impersonations and children's song performances to his bumbling foreign man character and the crude alter ego Tony Clifton. The film dives deep into Kaufman's distaste for mainstream sitcoms and his disdain for simply making people laugh, while also showcasing his craftiness in keeping his true intentions hidden. \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" explores the relationship between Kaufman and his managers, collaborators, and fellow artists, ultimately revealing that many of these connections were rooted in a shared love of deception and subversion of audience expectations. With the film culminating in a series of climactic moments featuring Kaufman's various characters, the audience is left wondering how much of Kaufman's life and career were part of the act, and how much was genuine. The movie captures the essence of the groundbreaking and enigmatic figure that was Andy Kaufman, simultaneously blending biographical storytelling with the very themes that defined Kaufman's career — illusion, deception, and the relentless pursuit of the unexpected. In the end, \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" leaves us pondering the true nature of entertainment, the art of comedy, and the intricate web of reality and fiction intricately woven by an unforgettable artist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure your vaccinations and immunizations are up-to-date.  If you can’t remember when you last had one, speak to your doctor — in some cases, it’s better to get a shot early than not at all.    These immunizations will help keep away many illnesses like the flu or the measles that have a fever as a symptom.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords.

Washington’s mix of toughness and beauty has attracted a dedicated following for the ABC political series, and made its 36-year-old star the first African-American female to helm her own primetime show in nearly four decades. And while her character is usually unflappable, Washington finds beauty in how her own life isn’t so. “I don’t have to be perfect. All I have to do is show up and enjoy the messy, imperfect journey of my life,” she told Oprah. ||||| Gwyneth Paltrow: My Family Makes Me Feel Beautiful      She may be PEOPLE's 2013 Most Beautiful Woman but Gwyneth Paltrow insists her kids , Apple, 8, and Moses, 7, don't see her as anything but mom.\\"Around the house, I'm in jeans and a T-shirt.

The Academy Award winning actress, who has been blasted for everything lately from the strict diet she has her kids on to her fancy new cookbook with ridiculously expensive ingredients, is in hot water again after collaborating on a string bikini line for children that she is selling on her GOOP website, which one expert exclusively tells RadarOnline.com sexualizes little girls and inevitably promotes eating disorders.      The Melissa Odabash for GOOP “exclusive kids new york bikini set,” retails for 45 and the skimpy string bikini is modeled by a little girl, striking a mature pose, on the GOOP website.      PHOTOS: Gwyneth Paltrow Is Featured In Self Magazine      “This kind of sexualized children’s bikini line is not in girls’ best interest,” Eating Disorder Specialist and Cognitive Behavioral Therapist Dr. Carol Fishbein, Ph.D. tells RadarOnline.com exclusively about the sexy swimsuits.      “We are sexualizing young, innocent children, before they will know how to protect themselves or be fully aware of what could be happening to them. With verbal comments, lewd looks or even worse.”      PHOTOS: Gywneth Paltrow Looks Flawless At Forty At The Golden Heart Gala      Fishbein specifies that the fact the bikinis are held together by strings is extremely disturbing in itself, because they not only promote eating disorders, but they keep children from getting to engage in normal beach activities and enjoying the innocence of their youth.      “These kinds of bathing suits promote low self-esteem, negative body image and eating disorders, because of the focus on the appearance of a young girl and keeping her restricted from being able to run around and enjoy the health and power of her own body through running and splashing in the water, jumping, doing somersaults and headstands,” she says.      PHOTOS: Gwyneth Paltrow Shares Family Vacation Snaps from St Lucia      “These bikinis are tied together with flimsy strings that easily open, contributing to a girl having to check and recheck her skimpy sexualized clothing rather than enjoying her power and her body,” the therapist adds.      As girls will inevitably be sexualized later on in their youth, she firmly believes that it is a parent’s duty to protect them when they are still very young.      “Parents should make clothing choices that protect the innocence of their children. These bathing suits call attention to sexuality and this will get in the way of children enjoying the joy of their bodies as innocent, protected children, which they are more entitled to. Sexy chic will be upon them soon enough, but at age 4 if we can’t protect, then what is wrong with us?”      WATCH: Gwyneth Paltrow & Robert Downey, Jr. In Iron Man 3 Trailer      Instead of focusing on how a little girl looks, parents should focus more on who she is as a person, Dr. Fishbein suggests.      “What we want is for young girls to have fun in their life and develop their athletic abilities, recognize the ability to develop friendships and close relationships within their family; to have school and personality achievements and not to have their values centered on their appearance or sexuality, especially at such a young age.”      PHOTOS: 10 Stars Who Have Defended Their Super Skinny Bodies      Do you think Gwyneth Paltrow — who is the mother of an eight-year-old daughter, Apple — went too far with collaborating on string bikinis for young girls?

This guide will help you with the process of applying for a passport renewal, breaking down each step to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience. Step 1: Retrieve Your Old Passport Before you start, it is crucial to have your old passport on hand. This is because you will need the information from it in order to complete the renewal forms accurately. If your passport was lost, damaged, or stolen, you will need to apply for a new passport and report the incident to the authorities. Step 2: Get New Passport Photos The next step is to obtain new passport photos for your passport renewal application. The photos must meet the following requirements: - 2x2 inches in size - Color photo with a white background - Taken within the last six months - Front view, full face, and with a neutral facial expression or a natural smile - Item of clothing that you wear daily, and no head coverings, unless for religious purposes - No glasses, unless you require them for medical reasons Many drugstores, photography studios, and even post offices provide passport photo services. Ensure that you obtain at least two identical photos for your application. Step 3: Download the Correct Form To renew your passport, you will need to complete Form DS-82 (U.S. Passport Renewal Application for Eligible Individuals). You can download this form from the U.S. Department of State website. Some important details you will need to provide in the form include your personal information, emergency contact details, and travel plans (if applicable). Make sure to fill out the form accurately and legibly to avoid delays in processing your application. Step 4: Decide on Passport Options When applying for a passport renewal, you can choose between a passport book, passport card, or both. It is essential to determine which option best suits your travel needs. - Passport Book: A passport book is the most common form of a passport and is required for international air travel. It contains 28 pages for entry and exit stamps, visa stickers, and other travel documentation. A standard passport book is valid for ten years (for applicants 16 years and older) or five years (for applicants under 16). - Passport Card: A passport card is a wallet-sized travel document that can be used for land and sea travel between the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. However, you cannot use a passport card for international air travel. Like a passport book, a standard passport card is valid for ten years (for applicants 16 years and older) or five years (for applicants under 16). - Both: If you frequently travel across borders by land or sea but also need a passport book for international flights, you can choose to apply for both the passport book and passport card simultaneously. Step 5: Check Processing Times Online Before mailing in your renewal application, it is a good idea to check the current passport processing times on the U.S. Department of State website. Standard processing times vary but can take between 4 to 8 weeks. If you need your passport urgently, expedited processing and overnight delivery options are available at an additional cost. Be prepared to provide proof of your travel itinerary or an emergency situation if opting for expedited processing. Conclusion Applying for a passport renewal can be an easy and hassle-free process when following this step-by-step guide. Ensure that you have your old passport, new passport photos, and the correct form. Decide on the type of passport that meets your travel needs and check the processing times online before submitting your application. With proper planning and preparation, you will be ready to enjoy your international travels with a renewed passport in no time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will want to find accommodations as close as possible to minimize travel delays. Reliable transportation is also an important consideration, whether you will work with a car service or transportation provided by the hotel or reserve a rental car.","output":"Additionally, it's vital to consider the specific needs and preferences of the executive(s) you are accommodating. Some executives might prefer luxury hotels, while others might appreciate more low-key or boutique hotels. Location is not just about proximity to work, it's also about what is in the surrounding area. Are there good places to eat or go for a jog? Is the hotel in a safe and lively neighborhood? All of these are key considerations.  Once you've sourced potential accommodations, compare them based on amenities, cost, and guest reviews. Amenities such as free Wi-Fi, business centers, fitness centers, and room service can make a substantial difference in the executive's comfort and productivity. If the executive is planning to entertain or hold meetings within the hotel, check for meeting space availability and catering options as well.  Cost is another crucial factor. While it's important to ensure the executive's comfort, it's also necessary to consider the company's budget. Try negotiating rates with hotels, particularly if you're securing accommodation for an extended stay or multiple rooms.  It's also recommended to read reviews from previous business travelers. They often provide valuable insights about the quality of service, convenience of the location, and other factors that matter to business travelers. You can find such reviews on numerous online platforms, some of which are specifically dedicated to business travel. Keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to provide a stress-free and positive experience for the executive. The ideal accommodations should allow them to rest comfortably, work efficiently, and access their work location and other required amenities without difficulty. It's also good if the accommodations provide a positive overall impression of the place they are visiting, as that can enhance the overall success of their business trip.  Finally, once the accommodations are booked, ensure that all the details - including check-in/check-out times, transportation needs, and any special requests like dietary restrictions for the room service or early room preparation for incoming red-eye flights, are communicated to the hotel's front desk or concierge service prior to the executive's arrival. This step ensures that everything goes smoothly upon their arrival and throughout their stay. Overall, organizing executive accommodations is a multi-step process that requires thorough research, good judgment, and meticulous attention to detail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the case of a spring, the force exerted by the spring is given by Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by the spring (F) is proportional to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position (x). The proportionality constant, denoted as k, is called the spring constant and is a measure of the spring's stiffness. Mathematically, Hooke's Law is represented as: F = -k * x The negative sign indicates that the force exerted by the spring is always in the opposite direction of the displacement, which means the spring force is a restoring force – it tries to bring the spring back to its equilibrium position. When an object is attached to a spring and is displaced from its equilibrium position, the spring stores potential energy. This potential energy (U) in a spring can be represented by the following equation: U = (1/2) * k * x^2 As the object oscillates back and forth, the potential energy stored in the spring is converted into kinetic energy and vice versa, while the total mechanical energy remains constant. This conservation of mechanical energy is the key characteristic of a conservative force, including the force exerted by a spring. Therefore, the force of a spring is a conservative force because it conserves the total mechanical energy in the system. Throughout the oscillation, the energy transforms between potential and kinetic energy without any energy loss, provided that no non-conservative forces like friction or air resistance are acting upon the system. The nature of the spring force as a conservative force allows us to analyze and predict the behavior of mechanical systems, such as oscillators and mass-spring systems, using fundamental principles of conservation laws."},{"instruction":"This article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was imprisoned in Stirling in 1694?, what is it ?

British scientists have developed a robot which they are training to complete that very task. The robot - which they have named Boris - is the first to have enough intelligence to work out how to grip any single item put in front of it. Scroll down for video. A Birmingham University project has created a robot that can grab plates and cups. It can work out how to pick up different objects placed in front of it. Called 'Boris' (shown) it is controlled by three separate computers. While that is sufficient for most factory production, creating a robot which can pick up and manipulate any single item hugely increases its potential use for industry, surgery, or in the home. The development marks a huge step forward in robotics. Until now robots could only pick up items of a fixed size, placed in a fixed location. Boris - who was publicly unveiled at the British Science Festival in Birmingham today - is controlled by three different computers and has cost £350,000 (570,000) to build. Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal. ‘The scenario that we've got is to get the robot to load a dishwasher,’ he said. ‘That's not because I think that dishwasher-loading robots are an economic, social necessity right now. It's because it encapsulates an incredibly hard range of general manipulation tasks. ‘Once you can crack that, once you can manipulate an object that you've never seen before, you can do a whole bunch of different things. ‘Loading a dishwasher is a really hard task.’ The Boris robot has been created by British scientists. Boris has thick multi-jointed arms that enable it to pick up objects. The robot can learn various grips and costs £350,000 (570,000) to build. Boris the robot's hands can learn the dexterity needed to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes. Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday. Safely confined to a basement laboratory, he reached out with a thick multi-jointed aluminium arm and picked up a measuring jug followed by a dustpan before depositing them in a tray. Significantly, Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip to grasp an edge. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking or dropping them. ‘You've got all the freedom of having all these fingers, so now your brain has got to work really hard,’ said Prof Wyatt. ‘The robot comes up with about 1,000 different grasps in its head in about 10 seconds.’ Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday. Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip. He added: ‘It is fairly commonplace to programme robots to pick up particular objects and move them around - factory production lines are a good example of this. But when those objects vary in size or shape, robots tend to get clumsy. ‘The system we have developed allows the robot to assess the object and generate hundreds of different grasp options. That means the robot is able to make choices about the best grasp for the object it has been told to pick up, and it doesn't have to be re-trained each time the object changes.’ This could have major applications in industry. The project, called Pacman, has been carried out in collaboration with the universities of Pisa in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria, and is funded by the European Commission. The team has already patented the technology, and is working with a firm in Coventry to develop a version of Boris that co-operates with humans on the factory floor. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking them. Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal. ‘It might be five or 10 years in the future, but you're going to have robots working with humans, and that means they're going to have to cope with all the uncertainty that humans introduce into the environment,’ he said. ‘One of the really big problems on robot assembly lines is if you want to change the part shapes. At the moment, when the world changes, the whole system breaks down. You want to be able to change the parts on short runs very, very quickly.’ A lot more work is needed before a new generation of Boris robots is sent into the real world. The next big step for the scientists is to get Boris to use both his arms and transfer objects from one hand to another. ‘Being bi-manual is a real advantage for all sorts of purposes,’ said Prof Wyatt, who hopes to see the robot stacking plates by next April.

[-] potato chips and other sweets..","output":"They bought them candies instead of potato chips, because they love the candies and other sweets. This decision was influenced by a few factors that show their preference for candies over potato chips, as well as the benefits of choosing sweets in specific situations. Here is a detailed explanation of why they opted for candies instead of potato chips. Firstly, it's essential to understand the individuals' taste preferences. Candies and other sweets are usually more appealing to people with a sweet tooth than salty snacks like potato chips. There is something satisfying about the syrupy, sugary, and sometimes even fruity flavors in candies that satiate the cravings of those who have an undeniable fondness for sweets. This could be a significant reason why they chose candies over potato chips as they were catering to their inclination towards sweet treats. Secondly, candies offer a more versatile range of flavors and textures, which may have contributed to choosing them over potato chips. While potato chips primarily deliver a crispy and salty experience, candies come in various forms, such as gummies, hard candies, chocolates, and caramels. This assortment plays a vital role in satisfying diverse palates, making them a more attractive option for those who enjoy exploring different tastes and textures. Another possible reason for choosing candies over potato chips is the nostalgic factor. Candies often remind people of their childhood memories, which brings a sense of comfort and happiness. It is not uncommon for individuals to associate sweet treats with special occasions, parties, or rewards from their younger years. On the other hand, potato chips might not evoke the same cherished emotions in people. By opting for candies, they might be attempting to relive some fond memories and feelings connected to these confections. Furthermore, candies may be better suited to specific occasions or situations. For instance, if they were selecting treats to incorporate into a gift basket or share during a party, candies might be considered a better alternative. They are visually appealing, individually wrapped, and can be easily portioned, which makes them suitable for gifting purposes or sharing among a group of people. In contrast, potato chips might be a less appealing gift, harder to divide equally, and could get crushed easily during transportation. Lastly, it's essential to consider potential health-related reasons for selecting candies over potato chips. Although candies may contain high sugar content, they can still be consumed in moderation. They might not contain unhealthy fats and the preservatives commonly found in some potato chips. Some candy varieties contain healthier ingredients like dark chocolate, which is rich in antioxidants. Therefore, candies could be viewed as a slightly healthier option compared to potato chips, depending on the person's dietary requirements. In conclusion, they chose to buy candies instead of potato chips because they love the candies and other sweets for their versatile range of flavors, nostalgic connections, adaptability to specific occasions, and possible health-related factors. It becomes evident that their choice was driven by the desire to cater to taste preferences, satisfy their cravings, and uphold cherished memories associated with candies from their past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen.  Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned.  After the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane, Austria denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said.  Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed that no Italians were on the flight, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it.  On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy.  Maraldi's father, Walter, told police that he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.

Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Two of Ablett's brothers played in the Victorian Football League - Kevin Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and Geelong, and Geoff Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and St Kilda.  Ablett's eldest son, Gary Ablett Jr., has followed in his footsteps to play for Geelong. In 2007 and 2009, Ablett Jr. won the Cats' best and fairest award, emulating a feat established by his father in his first season with the Cats back in 1984; he also won the Brownlow Medal in 2009 and 2013. Another son, Nathan, was drafted in 2004 (48th pick) by Geelong under the father-son rule. Nathan initially refused to play AFL Football because of his father's experience with the media, but, with encouragement from the club, was signed ahead of the 2005 AFL Season and has since established himself in the full forward role Gary Snr made his own. On 29 September 2007, both Gary Jr. and Nathan contributed to Geelong winning its first flag in 44 years, capturing the premiership that proved elusive to Gary Snr in his 12 years at the club. Nathan retired suddenly before the 2008 season, but he and his brother Gary Jr. were members of the Gold Coast Football Club's inaugural team for the 2011 season.  In addition to his sons, Ablett has a nephew, Luke Ablett, who played for the Sydney Swans and won a premiership with them in 2005.

I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas.

News article: A much-anticipated meeting between the US president Barack Obama and the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani did not happen on Tuesday, according to White House officials.      There had been speculation that the pair would meet on the fringes of the United Nations general assembly in New York, in what would have been the first such encounter since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah of Iran in 1979.      But Obama administration officials said that while the US offered a meeting, the Iranian delegation turned it down, saying it was \\"too complicated\\".      Officials from the two countries have been discussing the logistics of an \\"encounter\\" in the UN complex in mid-town Manhattan for several days, a UN official confirmed to the press pool travelling with Obama. In the end though, the official said, it was \\"too complicated for Iranians to do at this point\\".      Theres was no immediate statement from the Iranian delegation. But Press TV, Tehran's English-language television station, gave alcohol as the reason that Rouhani had missed one possible venue for a handshake or a few shared words, the lunch traditionally hosted by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon on the opening day of the general assembly. When guests gathered in the delegates lounge of the UN building, they were seated at tables upon which white and red wine were served – a facility that proved too much for the Muslim theologian Rouhani.      The White House said that a meeting would go ahead on Thursday between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, his Iranian counterpart and other foreign ministers from the other permanent security council members, plus Germany. That meeting is intended to address reviving negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme.      In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday warned that the world \\"should not be fooled\\" by signs of moderation by Rouhani and must keep up the pressure on Tehran. \\"Iran thinks soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb,\\" Netanyahu said.      In his UN speech, Obama said he had assigned Kerry to oversee negotiations with Tehran. In the past those talks had been led by a succession of State Department diplomats, and critics had complained there was no one in the administration who was in charge of US-Iran policy.      He also offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture, making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA's well-documented role in the ousting of Iran's democratically-elected government in 1953. \\"This mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs, and America's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war,\\" Obama said.      The reference to the CIA's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran's democratically elected leader, marked a first official admission of that role, and represented an important gesture to Rouhani. It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long-festering Iranian sense of injustice. The coup, support by both the US and the UK, paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah, and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it.      \\"I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight. The suspicions run too deep. But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear programme that can be a major step,\\" Obama said.      Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during an interview with state television at the presidency in Tehran, Iran. Photograph: Rouzbeh Jadidoleslam/AP      The abortive attempt to arrange a meeting between Obama and Rouhani was an echo of a similar incident in 2000 when it was expected that the two leaders at the time, Bill Clinton and Mohammad Khatami, would break the ice in the frozen relationship with the same kind of \\"chance encounter\\", but Khatami pulled out at the last moment.      The Iranian skittishness on both occasions reflected the delicate stand-off between hawks and doves in Tehran. Moderate leaders like Rouhani and Khatami have to choose their battles carefully and not give hostages to fortunes. Being pictured with an American president without being able to deliver real diplomatic or economic gains for Iran could be cast as weakness or even betrayal if the political winds in Iran change once again.      \\"The Iranians have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western nations,\\" a senior administration official told reporters.      The last few encounters between US and Iranian officials have been brief affairs. The last one was in the Hague at a conference on Afghanistan where the late American special envoy Richard Holbrooke had a \\"cordial\\" chat with an Iranian deputy foreign minister in 2009.      The choreography of diplomatic handshakes at UN gatherings in New York has a long history; getting it wrong can have painful consequences. In 2004 the then British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, got into hot water after he shook the hands of the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, at a UN reception in New York; Straw later claimed he had made the gesture by mistake in the dark. ||||| TEHRAN — This is Hassan Rouhani’s moment. The toast of the United Nations, the new Iranian president is busy granting interviews to select audiences and possibly cramming in a meeting with President Obama — the first such high-level get-together since the 1979 revolution. But when he stands before the world to speak on Tuesday, he will do so as the loyal representative of Iran’s supreme leader, the ultimate authority behind the country’s recent diplomatic charm offensive.      Since his election in June, Mr. Rouhani has made no secret of his wish to reach an accord with the West on Iran’s nuclear program — and no secret that the only reason he can reach out so conspicuously is that he has the support, for now anyway, of one man, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader.      “Rouhani can only attempt to have direct talks because the supreme leader has agreed to it; otherwise, Rouhani would not be in New York now,” said Hamid-Reza Taraghi, an insider who is one of the few people trusted to interpret for the public the supreme leader’s sermons and speeches. “The president and his team enter any talks only under the leader’s direct command.”      An enigmatic and cunning man, Ayatollah Khamenei, 74, is the one who gave Mr. Rouhani the authority to pursue a deal with the United States, top aides to Mr. Rouhani and outside experts say, and could just as easily cut off support — as he has done to some Iranian leaders before, including Mr. Rouhani.      Ayatollah Khamenei sees himself as a sort of referee of Iran’s complex political system, sitting in judgment of the politicians he anoints to lead the country in what are often sharply different directions. In 1997, for example, he blessed the reformist candidacy of Mohammad Khatami, who relaxed some social restrictions and allowed more press freedom.      But he allowed the hard-liners to undermine Mr. Khatami’s presidency, and in 2005 he pinwheeled to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the strident nationalist hard-liner, who denied the Holocaust and antagonized the West for much of his eight years in office.      This year, in a surprise to almost all Iran watchers, Ayatollah Khamenei has seemed to get behind Mr. Rouhani’s diplomatic push, talking in somewhat opaque but nevertheless conciliatory terms of “heroic flexibility.” And on Monday, in another gesture of support for Mr. Rouhani, Iran released 80 political prisoners. But the question for many here is, how much room will the supreme leader allow for diplomacy before pulling the rug out from under Mr. Rouhani?      This is not the first go-round for Ayatollah Khamenei and Mr. Rouhani, himself something of a prodigy who was once the darling of the clerics who founded the Islamic republic. In 2003 Mr. Rouhani, then the chief nuclear negotiator, persuaded Ayatollah Khamenei to suspend uranium enrichment for several months in hopes of reaching a nuclear deal. But the negotiations broke down, and Mr. Rouhani was banished from the circles of power before being resurrected this spring.      From Ayatollah Khamenei’s perspective, experts say, it makes perfect sense to stand back and allow Mr. Rouhani to conduct talks with the country’s main adversary.      “Everybody understands that Supreme Leader Khamenei is in a win-win situation,” said Mojtaba Mousavi, an Iranian political commentator who is often briefed by officials close to the leader. He explained that if talks lead to the reduction or elimination of the economic sanctions that have damaged Iran’s economy, Ayatollah Khamenei will get the credit for approving the new negotiating strategy.      But Ayatollah Khamenei can also take the credit if the talks should collapse. “If talks fail to reach any results, he will be praised for having proved his warnings over the dishonesty by the West towards Iran,” said Mr. Mousavi. “In that case his doubts will be proved once again.”      Experts here say that Ayatollah Khamenei, who was appointed supreme leader in 1989, is interested in testing the flexibility of the United States in negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, which it says is for peaceful uses but the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A meeting between President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not take place as anticipated on Tuesday at the United Nations general assembly in New York. It would have marked the first encounter since the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979.

The White House confirmed that a meeting would happen on Thursday between US Secretary of State John Kerry, his Iranian counterpart, and other foreign ministers from the permanent security council members, plus Germany. This meeting intends to address reviving negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. In his UN speech, Obama assigned Kerry to oversee negotiations with Tehran, making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA's involvement in overthrowing Iran's government in 1953.

Summarize the following: In addition to benefits like weight loss, exercise has also been linked to fewer depressive symptoms and a lowered risk of heart disease. This means that keeping a regular exercise routine will keep you feeling uplifted, energized, and secure in your good health. If you find it difficult to find the motivation to begin, try starting small by adding brisk walks to your week. Then, you can gradually increase the amount of cardiovascular or strength training exercise to the degree that your lifestyle permits. Try to exercise in ways that increase your flexibility. This way you will learn to see your body as something that is always evolving and changing. Do you ever have those unbearably happy mornings? The type where you find yourself smiling at everyone on an early grocery run, for example? These experiences may actually change how you see yourself and how others see you, too. Compared to people who are not smiling, folks who tend to show their pearly whites more often are considered by others to be more sincere, social, and even competent. Even if you don't feel like it. It'll make you feel and look a lot happier! Remember that taking good care of your teeth is a great way to increase confidence in your smile. Brush and floss regularly, and reduce your risk of tooth decay by rinsing your mouth out after eating or drinking sugary foods. Spend as much time as possible doing things that let you see how talented and capable you are. A feeling of accomplishment is part of what creates the sort of beauty that emanates from within. This may seem obvious, but sometimes the things we're truly good at can slip away from us if a job or school responsibilities ask that we diverge from our talents. For example, if writing is your forte, craft poems and prose in your spare time. If you're brilliant at sports, join a team that plays on the weekends so that you'll always get your healthy dose of competition. Remember that healthy eating is not the same as going on a diet. Diets tend to be temporary and unsustainable in the long run. Eating well requires habits like introducing more fresh veggies, fruits, and whole grains to your shopping list, and cooking with a good degree of variety. If you're big on foods with lots of fat, sugar, and salt, consider cutting back significantly.  Because balance is key, treating yourself is also a part of eating well. If you're tempted by the occasional ice cream cone or pastry, don't deny yourself outright--this is where moderation comes in. Treating yourself will help you remember that how you treat yourself is a big part of the self-confidence that makes you radiant. When you are at ease, people will respond positively, making you feel attractive and present to others. Think about it--when you see someone who looks comfortable in her skin, you can't help but want to be a part of that relaxed way of being. The following are helpful practices that will slowly lower the amount of tension you habitually carry in your body:  Progressive muscle relaxation Yoga Intentional breathing If you feel physically uncomfortable in what you’re wearing, you will begin to develop an oppositional relationship to your body; in other words, a negative body image. Forcing yourself into clothes that don't fit well will make you see your body as too large or too small to wear what you want to wear. Especially for women, wearing well-fitting clothing can change your perception of yourself for the better, increasing your confidence related to emotional management, social skills, and work-related tasks.","output":"Exercise offers numerous benefits, including weight loss, reduced depressive symptoms, and lowered risk of heart disease, leading to improved overall well-being. A regular exercise routine and maintaining flexibility can have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Smiling more often can make you appear more sincere, social, and competent to others, while good dental care boosts smile confidence. Pursue activities that highlight your talents and capabilities to foster inner beauty. Healthy eating, rather than temporary diets, can lead to sustainable wellness, with occasional treats in moderation. Practice relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and intentional breathing to reduce tension. Wearing well-fitted clothing can improve self-perception and confidence in various aspects of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To thoroughly analyze their similarity, let's break down each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"Got some Heine and coors light i started it last night xanis.\\" This sentence has two main parts:  1. The mention of specific drinks (Heine and Coors Light) - This is additional information that the second sentence lacks. 2. The action of starting something (it) last night - This part is present in both sentences and can also be linked to 'xanis' in both sentences, which might represent the name of an event, social gathering, or person. Sentence 2: \\"i started it last night xanis.\\" This sentence focuses solely on the action of starting something last night and connects it to 'xanis' as well.

Question: Where does Louis take his son's corpse? Movie title: Pet Sematary Movie plot: The Creed family â Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage â move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat Church is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned Micmac burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. He tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the Micmac ground after he was killed in World War II. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying...

These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as \\"Kannada country\\". Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda, Vyakarana (grammar), Jyotisha (astronomy and astrology), Sahitya (literature), Mimansa (Exegesis), Dharmashastra (law), Puranas (ritual), and Nyaya (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Although both sentences attempt to convey a similar idea, there are subtle differences in their meanings and structures. Sentence 1: \\"The real basis of the flower is that lenses can never focus perfectly in the physical world.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is \\"the real basis of the flower.\\" It suggests that there is a fundamental reason underlying the concept of a \\"flower\\" being discussed. The explanation provided is that \\"lenses can never focus perfectly in the physical world.\\" This sentence implies that the imperfection of lenses in the physical world has to do with the core essence or nature of the \\"flower.\\" The sentence structure emphasizes the link between the \\"flower\\" and the inability of lenses to focus perfectly, making it a central point. Sentence 2: \\"The physical basis of bloom is that, in the real world, lenses can never focus perfectly.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is \\"the physical basis of bloom.\\" It states that the foundation of the \\"bloom\\" is rooted in a tangible or real-world factor. The explanation provided is that \\"lenses can never focus perfectly.\\" By placing \\"in the real world\\" within commas, it indicates the occurrence of this imperfection happening in the real world, but this detail receives less emphasis in this sentence structure.  There are two main differences between these sentences: 1. The first sentence discusses the \\"real basis of the flower\\" while the second sentence talks about the \\"physical basis of bloom.\\" Although both appear to talk about a practical or real-world foundation, the first sentence is more about understanding the true nature or essence of a \\"flower,\\" while the second sentence focuses on the tangible aspect of the \\"bloom.\\" 2. The difference in emphasis placed on the \\"real world\\" or \\"physical world\\" aspect of the lens imperfections, as mentioned earlier. In the first sentence, this detail is interwoven into the main point of the sentence, while in the second sentence, it's mentioned more like a supplementary piece of information. In conclusion, while both sentences do share a similar idea about the imperfection of lenses in the physical world and its relation to a flower or bloom, the subtle differences in structure and emphasis give them slightly different meanings. The first sentence is more concerned with the true essence of a \\"flower\\" and its connection with lens imperfections, whereas the second sentence focuses on the tangible aspect of the \\"bloom\\" and its basis in the real world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river.

To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present.\\" It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.\\"  Answer:","output":"The Humanist Manifesto, published in 1933, was based on the collective input of prominent figures such as Raymond B. Bragg, Leon Milton Birkhead, Charles Francis Potter, members of the Western Unitarian Conference, and others interested in promoting a modern, non-theistic and ethical worldview. The drafting of the document was entrusted to Roy Wood Sellars, who synthesized the ideas and values of these contributors to create the Humanist Manifesto. The Manifesto aimed to establish a new religion relevant to the contemporary world, emphasizing the importance of adapting religious principles according to the needs of each age. The Manifesto identified and presented 15 theses, which served as foundational principles for modern humanism. These theses touched on various aspects of humanist values, including reason, ethics, science, and social progress. The key elements of the Humanist Manifesto included: 1. A rejection of traditional theism and supernaturalism in favor of a naturalistic worldview. 2. Emphasis on the importance of reason, scientific inquiry, and critical thinking in shaping human understanding and ethical values. 3. Affirming the inherent worth and dignity of every human being, regardless of their beliefs or background. 4. Encouraging cultural and intellectual diversity, along with the importance of individual freedom and civil liberties. 5. The development of ethical values based on human experience and needs, rather than divine authority or sacred texts. 6. A belief in human responsibility for solving global problems and promoting progress through education, social justice, and ethical behavior. 7. Emphasis on the interconnectedness of human society, promoting cooperation and a global ethic in addressing common challenges. Potter's book and the Humanist Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, providing a foundation for secular ethics and the promotion of human well-being over supernatural belief. The Humanist Manifesto has since been revised and updated, most notably with the Humanist Manifesto II published in 1973 and the Humanism and Its Aspirations published in 2003, reflecting the ongoing evolution of humanist thought in response to changing social, cultural, and intellectual contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Он создавался как картина, которую нужно рассматривать из статического положения. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The sentence you provided translates to English as: \\"It was created as a painting that needs to be viewed from a static position.\\" In providing a more detailed explanation, the sentence seems to suggest a piece of work made with a specific viewing method in mind; this work is likened to a painting which has to be appreciated from a stationary angle. This implies that the best way to fully absorb and appreciate the magnitude and details of the work (possibly an artwork, sculpture, or any form of display) is by examining it from a particular or fixed perspective. It entails that the observer should not alter their viewing angle in order to sufficiently grasp the purpose and aesthetic value the creator intended. Similar to observing a painting in a museum, we often have to position ourselves at an appropriate distance and angle to see and comprehend the whole picture. Our evaluation often becomes reliant on the static nature of our viewpoint, which allows us to focus on the details and uncover multiple layers of interpretation. Therefore, this sentence beautifully captures the idea of patience and careful examination in appreciating art or any detailed work, asserting the necessity of a stationary, uninterrupted perspective over a hurried, variable one. Moreover, it also comments subtly on the importance of the creator's intention in influencing the viewer's perspective, relating to the broader concept of subjective versus objective understanding in art appreciation. It emphasizes the value of the individual's experience in interpreting artistic intention, with the condition set by the creator of the artwork – viewing from a static position in this case – possibly guiding or even limiting that interpretation. In the wider context, this statement could also be used metaphorically to represent a belief, opinion, or viewpoint that should be examined from a fixed perspective to be truly understood and valued. It could symbolize the notion that certain situations should be analyzed or viewed from the same position in which they originally unfolded, without altering the perception or the context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Theknownriskfactorsforperipheralarterydiseasearethosethatpredisposetothedevelopmentofatherosclerosis.","output":"The known risk factors for peripheral artery disease are those that predispose to the development of atherosclerosis. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, usually the legs. This occurs mainly due to the buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) on the artery walls. PAD can cause leg pain during activities like walking or climbing stairs, known as intermittent claudication. Additionally, it can lead to more severe complications if not treated timely, such as leg ulcers, gangrene, and limb amputation. Atherosclerosis, the primary underlying cause of PAD, occurs when fatty deposits, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances accumulate in the artery walls, leading to the formation of plaques. These plaques can narrow the lumen of the arteries, causing blood flow reduction to the limbs. Several known risk factors predispose individuals to the development of atherosclerosis and subsequently, peripheral artery disease. These include: 1. Age: The risk of developing PAD increases with age. It is more common in individuals over 60 years old. 2. Smoking: Smoking damages blood vessels and contributes to the accumulation of plaque in the arteries. This increases the risk of developing PAD, and the risk is further heightened with long-term smoking. 3. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and promote plaque formation, increasing the risk of developing PAD. Diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from peripheral artery disease. 4. High blood pressure: Elevated blood pressure can put extra stress on the artery walls, making them more prone to plaque buildup and hardening. This increases the risk of atherosclerosis and PAD. 5. High cholesterol: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase plaque formation in the arteries. Elevated levels of triglycerides, another type of blood fat, can contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis as well. 6. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing PAD, as excess body fat can cause inflammation and damage blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis. 7. Lack of physical activity: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to many health issues, including obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels, all of which increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and PAD. 8. Family history: A history of PAD or cardiovascular disease in close family members may suggest a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis and increase the risk of developing peripheral artery disease. 9. Ethnicity: African American and Hispanic populations seem to have a higher prevalence of PAD compared to Caucasian populations, likely due to a mix of genetic and environmental factors. By recognizing and addressing these risk factors, individuals can work towards reducing their risk of developing peripheral artery disease. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, controlling diabetes and blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing high cholesterol levels through diet and medications can significantly reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, ultimately preventing the onset of peripheral artery disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chances of a stable night’s sleep at this age are increased if the child can fall asleep in their own room. Make this lower case.","output":"chances of a stable night’s sleep at this age are increased if the child can fall asleep in their own room. Here are some additional tips to help a child achieve a stable night's sleep in their own room: 1. Establish a consistent bedtime routine: Following a set routine every night can signal to the child that it's time to wind down and get ready for sleep. A bedtime routine might include activities such as taking a warm bath, reading a bedtime story, or listening to calming music. 2. Create a sleep-friendly environment: A child's bedroom should be conducive to sleep. This includes keeping the room cool, dark, and quiet, as well as providing a comfortable and supportive mattress and pillow. You can also use blackout curtains, a white noise machine, or a fan to minimize external disturbances. 3. Encourage the child to self-soothe: Teaching a child how to settle themselves back to sleep when they wake up during the night can help promote a more stable night's sleep. You can do this by providing a comfort object, such as a soft blanket or stuffed animal, that they can hold onto while they fall asleep. 4. Limit screen time before bed: Exposure to electronic devices that emit blue light can interfere with a child's natural sleep cycle. To avoid this, make sure to have a screen-free period of at least one hour before bedtime. 5. Avoid overstimulation before bedtime: To help a child wind down before bed, avoid engaging them in overly exciting or stimulating activities. Instead, opt for calming activities that can help them relax. 6. Be patient and consistent: Adjusting to a new sleep routine can take time, and it's essential to remain patient and consistent. Encourage your child's progress and reassure them if they experience difficulties falling asleep. Over time, you'll likely see improvement in their ability to fall (and stay) asleep in their own room. 7. Address any fears or anxieties: Sometimes children may have fears or anxieties that prevent them from sleeping in their own room. It's important to address these concerns calmly and reassure them that there is nothing to be afraid of. Provide comfort and support as needed until they feel safe and comfortable in their own space. By implementing these strategies, you can help your child feel more comfortable in their own room and increase the chances of a stable night's sleep at this age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest but by who bringing it to the east coast?\\" Answer: \\"Sri Maharaja\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Here is a goal: wash cloth Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of washing a cloth, I suggest the following step-by-step method which makes more sense: 1. Prepare the materials: Gather a basin or sink, mild detergent or soap, warm water, and a soft brush or sponge. This step helps in ensuring that you have everything you need to properly wash the cloth. 2. Fill the basin or sink with warm water: Warm water is effective in removing dirt and stains, as well as being gentle on most types of fabrics. 3. Add a small amount of mild detergent or soap: A mild detergent is less likely to damage the fabric or cause color fading, while still providing a thorough cleaning. 4. Mix the soap and water: Swirling your hand or sponge in the water helps in dissolving the soap/detergent and creating suds or bubbles that are essential for cleaning. 5. Submerge the cloth in the soapy water: Fully submerging the cloth ensures that all areas of the fabric receive adequate cleaning. 6. Gently agitate the cloth: Use your hands or a soft brush/sponge to gently rub the fabric in a back-and-forth motion or in small circular motions, focusing on any stains or heavily soiled areas. This step helps in loosening dirt and debris from the cloth fibers. 7. Let the cloth soak for a few minutes: Allowing the cloth to soak in the soapy water helps in further breaking down dirt and stains, making them easier to remove. 8. Rinse the cloth: Remove the cloth from the soapy water and hold it under clean running water or submerge it in a separate basin of clean water to remove soap residues. Repeat this process until all soap has been washed away. 9. Gently wring out excess water from the cloth: This step helps in speeding up the drying process and prevents water from dripping on surfaces. 10. Lay the cloth out to dry: Find a clean and flat surface, such as a drying rack or clothesline, and lay the cloth flat or hang it up, allowing it to air dry. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause fading or damage to some fabrics. This method ensures a thorough and gentle cleaning for the cloth while preserving its quality and appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  Paragraph: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia.

Suggest spending quality time with the person. Be prepared if any issues or problems arise between you and the person again.\\"","output":"Title: The Art of Acceptance and Forgiveness: Strengthening Bonds through Quality Time Introduction In our journey of life, we often encounter situations when misunderstandings and conflicts lead to emotional turmoil and distances between loved ones. Acceptance and forgiveness play a crucial role in bridging the gap, restoring harmony, and fostering healthy and nurturing relationships. Writing a heartfelt letter to the person affected can not only help alleviate the burden of unresolved emotions but also provide an opportunity to spend quality time together and help them cope with the challenges that life presents. Embracing Acceptance: A Sign of Emotional Maturity Acceptance is the ability to recognize the reality of a situation and come to terms with it, without attempting to change or control it. When we practice acceptance, we cultivate an attitude of understanding, empathy, and tolerance, making it easier to endure difficult situations. In your letter, acknowledge the differences and conflicts that may have occurred, admitting your own shortcomings and expressing your willingness to accept the person as they are. Forgiveness, the Path to Inner Peace and Stronger Relationships Holding on to resentment, anger, and grudges only increases our emotional baggage and leads to bitterness, preventing us from nurturing a healthy relationship. Forgiveness is an act of kindness and love – not just towards others but also oneself. As you write the letter, emphasize the importance of forgiveness and express the desire to let go of the past. Share how forgiveness would enable both of you to learn and grow, leading to a more balanced life and a stronger bond. Reconnecting through Quality Time Suggesting to spend quality time together is a step forward in rebuilding trust and strengthening connections. Quality time refers to the moments we dedicate to giving our undivided attention, actively engaging, and valuing the presence of another. In the letter, propose different activities that both of you could indulge in, like taking a walk in the park, having deep conversations, playing games, or even cooking a meal together. By doing so, you present an opportunity to overcome any awkwardness and establish a sense of camaraderie. Preparing for Future Challenges Despite our best intentions, life’s unpredictability may throw challenges that can cause conflicts or misunderstandings. While assuring your support to the person, be prepared to face any future issues with honesty, patience, and open-mindedness. As you write the letter, encourage them to believe in the power of resilience, acceptance, and forgiveness, which lay the foundation for an unwavering bond. A healthy relationship thrives when both parties willingly work through adversity, keeping the lines of communication open, and appreciating each other's perspectives. Conclusion In this era of digital communication, the value of a hand-written letter might seem outdated. However, it remains an intimate, personal, and touching method of expressing one's emotions and thoughts. By writing a letter focused on acceptance, forgiveness, and the desire to create meaningful memories, you invite the person to share a renewed connection. As you take this significant step towards healing past wounds, you reinforce the resilience of the human spirit and the potential of love and understanding to triumph over adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was a highly intelligent and religious woman  Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

Levine’s ninth tweet was the one which drew widespread interest, and it read:Soon we’ll start “temporary interment”. This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly–and temporary–manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take. 9/Levine’s thread began with the first transcribed tweet below, and the preceding seven to eight tweets led up to the “temporary internment” portion:NYC’s healthcare system is being pushed to the limit. And sadly, now so is the city’s system for managing our dead. And it, too, needs more resources. This has big implications for grieving families. And for all of us. 1/NYC’s “city morgue” is the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), which luckily is the best in the world. But they are now dealing w/ the equivalent of an ongoing 9/11. And so are hospital morgues, funeral homes & cemeteries. Every part of this system is now backed up. 2/A typical hospital morgue might hold 15 bodies. Those are now all full. So OCME has sent out 80 refrigerated trailers to hospitals around the city. Each trailer can hold 100 bodies. These are now mostly full too. Some hospitals have had to add a 2nd or even a 3rd trailer. 3/Grieving families report calling as many as half a dozen funeral homes and finding none that can handle their deceased loved ones. Cemeteries are not able to handle the number of burial requests and are turning most down. 4/It’s not just deaths in hospitals which are up. On an average day before this crisis there were 20-25 deaths at home in NYC. Now in the midst of this pandemic the number is 200-215. *Every day*. 5/Early on in this crisis we were able to swab people who died at home, and thus got a coronavirus reading. But those days are long gone. We simply don’t have the testing capacity for the large numbers dying at home. 6/Now only those few who had a test confirmation *before* dying are marked as victims of coronavirus on their death certificate. This almost certainly means we are undercounting the total number of victims of this pandemic. 7/And still the number of bodies continues to increase. The freezers at OCME facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn will soon be full. And then what? 8/Levine continued, concluding with a “recap” tweet:To recap: Nothing matters more in this crisis than saving the living. But we need to face the gruesome reality that we need more resources to manage our dead as well. Or the pain of this crisis will be compounded almost beyond comprehension. 13/13Naturally, Levine’s stark descriptions — particularly of “temporary internment” and mass graves in city parks (like Central Park) generated tremendous interest. That claim proved an eerie follow-up to an unrelated March 27 2020 viral tweet about the semantics (“temporary”) of mass graves:We are, at most, like 10 days away from semantic arguments about what qualifies as a \\"\\"mass\\"\\" grave.— Mass for Shut-ins (is a podcast) (@edburmila) March 27, 2020Incidentally, the “arguing about the semantics of mass graves” tweet was published on March 27 2020. Levine’s tweets were dated April 6 2020. That is, in fact, a difference of ten days:Two hours after the first Twitter thread, Levine clarified with a follow-up tweet in which he explained that the temporary mass graves were part of New York City’s contingency plans. He also said they would only be considered if the infection rates for COVID-19 kept climbing:This tweet has gotten a lot of attention. So I want to clarify:  the is a contingency NYC is preparing for BUT if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary. https://t.co/6wLO8qWtML— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) April 6, 2020According to the New York Times, New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio acknowledged the existence of such contingency plans, adding that the use of temporary mass graves was “under consideration” but not in place:Mayor Bill de Blasio said on [April 6 2020] that no such plan had been put in place yet, though he acknowledged it was under consideration.“If we need to do temporary burials to be able to tide us over to pass the crisis, and then work with each family on their appropriate arrangements, we have the ability to do that,” he said, adding, “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later.”The medical examiner’s office said in a statement, “We are planning for all possibilities, however no decision on this has been made, and there is still adequate capacity at this time.”The Times included some additional information from Levine which slightly contradicted DeBlasio’s remarks; further, Levine noted that the storage for deceased COVID-19 victims was almost at capacity in New York:Mr. Levine, however, said in an interview: “This is definitely not in the hypothetical stage now. I think it’s fair to say we are moving to do this.” … Mr. Levine said plans for the possible use of “temporary interment” had been mapped out as part of that plan. He said the city had to face the reality that “traditional burial system has largely frozen up.”“We are relying on freezers now to hold bodies, but that capacity is almost entirely used up,” he said, describing temporary interment as “essentially an extension of the freezer system.”In the ensuing discussion about the claims, Central Park was often mentioned as a possible site for temporary mass graves. That may have been due to Central Park’s prominence among people not personally familiar with Manhattan as well as its size; Levine referenced an established potter’s field on Hart Island (in the Bronx), but cited “logistical challenges” in accessing that site as well as city parks in general:Mr. Levine said the possible sites for mass burials would be a city park or on Hart Island in the Bronx, where inmates from Rikers Island are typically employed to bury the indigent in potter’s field.Hart Island has logistical challenges because it is inaccessible and it is a secure Department of Correction facility, so there are limitations on who can go there and under what circumstances, Mr. Levine said.The use of labor from Rikers’ Island to dig mass graves was a part of early reporting on COVID-19 in New York. On March 10 2020, Business Insider mentioned the same site Levine did, reporting:New York City’s contingency plan for ‘biological outbreaks’ includes mobile refrigerator units for dead bodies and mass graves dug by inmates… Inmates on Rikers Island would be transported to Hart Island to dig mass graves where the dead could be buried, and cremation efforts would be ramped up.Currently, Hart Island, which once housed a prison for Confederate soldiers, has two prepared mass graves that could accommodate 19,200 bodies, but there is another site that has yet to be cleared.That reporting also noted the plan itself was not new in 2020, but was designed during a previous disease outbreak in 2008 — which did not result in the need for mass graves:The plan was developed by the city’s late chief medical examiner, Charles Hirsch, in 2008, in response to concerns that Bird Flu would cause the next pandemic influenza. But as Hirsch states in the report, the plan can be used to tackle “other biological outbreaks” that cause mass fatalities.On March 31 2020, The Intercept reported that Rikers’ Island inmates were offered 6 hourly to begin digging mass graves for COVID-19 victims:NEW YORK CITY is offering prisoners at Rikers Island jail 6 per hour — a fortune by prison labor standards — and personal protective equipment if they agree to help dig mass graves on Hart Island, according to sources with knowledge of the offer. Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the general arrangement, but said that it was not “Covid-specific,” noting that prisoners have been digging graves on Hart Island for years.The offer is only being made to those with convictions, not those jailed before trial, as is generally the case. A memo sent to prisoners, according to a source who reviewed it, does not specify what the work on Hart Island will be, but the reference to PPE leaves little doubt. The offer comes as New York City continues to be the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, with 38,000 people infected and more than 914 dead so far.That earlier reporting by The Intercept closely echoed details in Levine’s Twitter thread, such as requirements for mass graves and space limitations on Hart Island. It also referenced the March 10 2020 Business Insider piece:Hart Island, though, “has limited burial space,” the report noted, and “may not be able to accommodate a large influx of decedents requiring burial,” which the preparedness plan estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000 in a pandemic with a mortality rate of 2 percent in which 25 to 35 percent of the population is infected.The city document proposed employing the Department of Defense’s “temporary mass internment method,” which places caskets 10 in a row, head to foot, so as not to stack them on top of each other. Hart Island is located off City Island in the Bronx. In 2008, Rikers prisoners were burying roughly 20 to 25 bodies per week there, the report found.Typically, the remains of decedents whose bodies are unclaimed or whose families cannot afford burial are interred on Hart Island. However, the internment of COVID-19 victims amounted to far more burials, far more frequently:Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can’t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. But recently, burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten.It is true that a New York City councilmember — Levine — disclosed the discussion of plans for mass burials or possible “temporary internments” of COVID-19 victims on Hart Island or in unspecified city parks. Levine and DeBlasio provided different information in terms of the planning stages, and existing information indicated that the plans had been in place since as early as 2008. Although all the information appears to be accurate, we are rating the overall trajectory of the reported mass graves plan as Unknown as of April 6 2020.Update, April 10 2020, 1:52 PM: Numerous outlets (such as the BBC and The Guardian) published aerial footage captured on April 9 2020 and depicting mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx:New York using mass graves amid coronavirus outbreakhttps://t.co/R61mrlbfdc pic.twitter.com/T0EctJmFPR— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) April 10, 2020NYC Mayor confirms they are now burying many #Covid19 corpses in mass graves on Hart Island.

Boiling or bubbling water usually indicates that the liquid has reached a high temperature where it transitions from liquid to vapor. This would suggest that the water is heated up and therefore hot.  Now let's examine the options provided: (A). intense heat - This is a possible answer, as boiling or bubbling water can imply that the water has reached a high enough temperature to cause it to become hot. Although \\"intense heat\\" may be a strong term, it is the closest option that matches the characteristics of boiling water. (B). cool water - This option is not likely correct because we know that boiling water is hot, not cool. Cool water would not exhibit bubbling or boiling. (C). melted water - Melted water refers to water that has transitioned from a solid (ice) to a liquid state. Although it is an accurate description of water in a liquid state, it doesn't directly relate to the given fact about water being boiling and hot, so it is not the most appropriate answer.

Pierre des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and a number of barons rushed to have the young Henry be crowned as King of England. London was held by Louis  and therefore could not be used for this coronation so, on 28 October 1216, they brought the boy from the castle at Devizes to Gloucester Abbey in front of a small attendance presided over by a Papal Legate, Guala Bicchieri . They crowned Henry with a band of gold made from a necklace. On 12 November 1216 the Magna Carta was reissued in Henry's name with some of the clauses omitted, including clause 61. The revised charter was sealed by the young king's regent William Marshal.  A great deal of the country was loyal to Prince Louis, with the southwest of England and the Midlands favouring Henry. Marshal was highly respected and he asked the barons not to blame the child Henry for his father's sins. The prevailing sentiment, helped by self-interest, disliked the idea of depriving a boy of his inheritance. Marshal also promised that he and the other regents would rule by Magna Carta.

News article: Update: After only a month of criticism—including from Nomad author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, below—the American Academy of Pediatrics has reversed a policy that advised American doctors to give a ceremonial pinprick to girls of immigrant families so that they would avoid seeking a full circumcision.      The American Academy of Pediatrics recently put forward a proposal on female genital mutilation. They would like that American doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or “nick” on girls born into communities that practice female genital mutilation.      Female circumcision is a custom in many African and Asian countries whereby the genitals of a girl child are cut. There are roughly four procedures. First there is the ritual pinprick. This is what Pediatrics refers to as the “nick” option. To give you an idea of what that means, visualize a preteen girl held down by adults. Her clitoris is tweaked so that the circumcizer can hold it between her forefinger and her thumb. Then she takes a needle and pierces it using enough force for it to go into the peak of the clitoris. As soon as it bleeds, the parents and others attending the ceremony cheer, the girl is comforted and the celebrations follow.      Ali Talks to The Daily Beast's Editor-In-Chief, Tina Brown, About \\"Nicking\\"      There is a more sinister meaning to the word “nick” if you consider the fact that in some cases it means to cut off the peak of the clitoris. Proponents compare “nicking” to the ritual of boy circumcision. But in the case of the boys, it is the foreskin that is all or partly removed and not a part of the penis head. In the case of the girls, the clitoris is actually mutilated.      Then there is the second method whereby a substantial part of the clitoris is removed and the opening of the vagina is sewn together (infibulation). The third variation adds to this the removal of the inner labia.      Finally, there is a procedure whereby as much of the clitoris as possible is removed along with the inner and outer labia. Then the inner walls of the vagina are scraped until they bleed and are then bound with pins or thorns. The tissue on either side grows together, forming a thick scar. Two small openings roughly equal to the diameter of a matchstick are left for urination and menstruation respectively.      Often these operations are done without anesthesia and with tools such as sharp rocks, razor blades, knives or scissors depending on the location, family income, and education. It is thus more accurate—as does the World Health Organization—to speak of female genital mutilation (FGM) instead of the obscure and positive-sounding “circumcision.”      According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, more than 130 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of female genital cutting. Some immigrant parents from countries like Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, and others in Europe and the United States, where FGM is common, continue this practice in the West even though they know that it is criminal. Some of them sneak their daughters out of the country during the long school summer vacation so that they can be subjected to any one of these forms of FGM.      Congressman Joseph Crowley (D-NY) recently introduced a bill to toughen federal laws by making it a crime to take a girl overseas to be circumcised. He argued, rightly, that FGM serves no medical purpose and is rightfully banned in the U.S. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

However, they have reversed this policy following criticism from author Ayaan Hirsi Ali. FGM involves cutting the female genitalia and is customary in many African and Asian countries. It has four main variations, ranging from a ritual pinprick to the removal of a substantial part of the clitoris and sewing the vagina closed, also known as infibulation. These procedures are often performed without anesthesia and with crude tools, and hence organizations like WHO prefer the term female genital mutilation over the ambiguous term, 'circumcision.' Over 130 million women worldwide have undergone some form of FGM. Immigrant parents continue this practice in the West, aware of its illegality, and often take their daughters overseas for these procedures. Congressman Joseph Crowley has proposed a new bill, making it a crime to take a girl overseas for FGM. The AAP's earlier proposal for a ritual pinprick was seen as a way to prevent the more severe forms of FGM, but it drew criticism as critics argue it normalises a fundamentally appalling practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Delaware: Can Coons Hold Off the Tea Party's O'Donnell? Delaware Senate candidates Republican Christine O'Donnell and Democrat Chris Coons Rob Carr / AP (2) Thanks to Christine O'Donnell and the Tea Party, a lot of Democrats are confident Joe Biden's former Delaware Senate seat is now in the bag. But their celebration may be premature. O'Donnell has already raised more than 1 million since her primary win, and while a competitive race is likely to cost several million dollars, she might not have much trouble, given the national support she'll be getting from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Sarah Palin. Chuckling Democrats would be wise to remember a woman named Martha Coakley was once considered a shoo-in in another reliably Democratic state, Massachusetts, only to become the first major political scalp of Tea Party politics. But Coakley turned out to be a lousy candidate and Scott Brown caught the world unawares. (See portraits of the Tea Party movement.) Things will be different this time. While some senior Republicans, including Karl Rove, seem convinced that O'Donnell can't win, not all Democrats (including Biden himself) agree. One party strategist with extensive Senate campaign experience told me after her win that he thinks O'Donnell's star power with the far right might enable her to raise money and generate enough enthusiasm to pull off an upset. (Comment on this story.) One reason this strategist said he's not more worried, however, is that he believes O'Donnell's (nationally) unknown Democratic opponent, Chris Coons, is no Martha Coakley. \\"He's very talented,\\" said my source. And he's not the only one to feel that way. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has already raved about Coons  perhaps to comedic excess  as \\"my pet ... my favorite candidate.\\" (Watch TIME's video \\"Meet the Tea Party.\\") Coons' résumé may not sport anything as colorful as O'Donnell's abstinence and antimasturbation crusading. But he did campaign for Ronald Reagan as a teenager before labeling himself, in a much-quoted-on-the-right college essay, a \\"bearded Marxist.\\" Now 47, Coons has served in county government for the past decade, with the last six years as executive of New Castle County  one of Delaware's three counties and home to about 500,000 of the state's roughly 900,000 residents. His pedigree may be easy for a Tea Partyer to sneer at  undergrad at Amherst, law and divinity school at Yale  but in a relatively prosperous Northeastern state like Delaware (where the unemployment rate is high, but lower than the national average), it may be an asset. (And remember: at least two other Tea Party darlings, Joe Miller in Alaska and Ken Buck in Colorado, also have Ivy League degrees.) Unlike some other Democrats recently running from it, Coons openly supports a cap-and-trade plan to combat global warming; sounds fairly conventional on education reform; and describes himself as a \\"Truman Democrat,\\" which has a slightly hawkish ring but could actually mean almost anything short of Kucinich-ism. (It's hard to find anything Coons has to say about Afghanistan beyond some milquetoasty criticism of Stanley McChrystal's infamous comments to Rolling Stone.) On MSNBC's Hardball Wednesday, Coons said he would have voted for both the health care bill and financial regulatory reform. He has also made an interesting proposal for a lifetime ban on Senate lobbying by former Senators, something unlikely to endear him to his potential new colleagues. (See \\"Republican Surprise: 10 More Scott Browns.\\") The big picture, however, is that this campaign will unfold in a state that went 62-37 for Obama in 2008, thanks in part to the place of local hero Joe Biden on the ticket. Biden already has plans to campaign and raise money for Coons. And polling shows Coons now with a double-digit lead. So Coons could probably get away with being just an ordinary candidate. Especially if the bet reflected by the unusual photo of his opponent on his campaign home page is the right one: just keep people talking about Christine O'Donnell.

Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In the Delaware Senate race, Democrats are confident about winning Joe Biden's former seat, but Christine O'Donnell's Tea Party support and ability to raise funds could lead to an upset. Democratic candidate Chris Coons is considered a strong contender, but the focus on O'Donnell's controversial past may also drive attention to the race."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who is supposed by a religious scholar of the time to place themselves in the position of god? Context: A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".

Movie title: Hannibal Rising Movie plot: In 1944, Lecter is eight years old, living in Lecter Castle; constructed by his paternal ancestor, Hannibal the Grim, in the Lithuanian countryside. Lecter, his younger sister, Mischa, and his parents escape to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. Back at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen (Grutas, Dortlich, Grentz, Kolnas, Milko, and Pot Watcher) request to join the Waffen-SS. The SS commander orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook who was left behind, to which they gleefully comply.A Soviet tank stops at the Lecters' lodge looking for water, and forces everyone out of the house. However, the tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it and the ensuing explosion kills everyone, except Hannibal and Mischa. The SS militiamen then loot Lecter Castle. Seeing their wounded SS commander, Grutas shoots him and takes his Iron Cross. However, the impending Russian advance forces them to hide out in the woods where they locate the Lecter lodge. The SS militiamen storm and take over the lodge. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Hannibal and Mischa.The movie then cuts to a scene eight years later inside Lecter Castle, which has been turned into a Soviet-run orphanage. A bully harasses Lecter, who has been rendered mute by his experiences, about not singing the orphanage anthem. The bully attacks his head, but Lecter blocks his swing with a fork, impaling the bully's hand. That evening, Lecter experiences a flashback about Mischa screaming in his sleep, which angers the youth commander, who locks him in a dungeon. However, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki-Lecter. She gets him to speak for the first time since his childhood, and instructs him about flower arrangement, martial arts and ancestor worship.At a local market, a butcher makes a crude and racist... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Hannibal Rising,\\" it is not explicitly mentioned who initially suspected Hannibal Lecter of the murders.

Paragraph- Sent 1:  Heavy wooden shutters dulled the noise of the boisterous gale outside. Sent 2: A thick red curtain hung over the door, and a cheery log fire burnt in the stove. Sent 3: A man and woman sat over it; the man, a tall, repulsive-looking creature, with unkempt hair and matted beard, his age apparently about fifty. Sent 4: The woman looked seventy or more. Sent 5: She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like appearance, in spite of her great height. Sent 6: She was dressed in limp, faded garments, with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in her bleared old eyes. Sent 7: There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily. Sent 8: She spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew. Sent 9: The youngest son produced a bottle containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits. Sent 10: As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there. Sent 11: Then they all sat down, excepting the old mother, who busied herself in waiting on them.  Question: Who has a scar on his hand?. A:","output":"Part 1: Identify the subject with the scar. Usage: In Sentence 10, \\"As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there.\\" The subject with the scar is referred to as \\"he.\\" This sentence meets the criteria because it mentions the presence of a scar on someone's hand. Part 2: Determine the identity of the subject with the scar. Usage: In Sentence 7, \\"There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily.\\" The man who had come home is the one who talked to Babette and his mother. This sentence meets the criteria because it connects the identity of the man who had the scar to coming home and speaking to Babette. Part 3: Answer the question based on the information from the paragraph. Usage: The correct answer is \\"the youngest son.\\" This answer meets the criteria because Sentence 7 and 10 provide enough information to identify the person who has a scar on his hand as the man who had come home and had a conversation with Babette."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No doubt intended as a totally campy joke, \\"Full Moon High\\" portrays 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. But otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most eye-opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on \\"Sanford and Son\\" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (aside from Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role).

The reviewer finds the film \\"Full Moon High\\" amusing and entertaining, highlighting the performances of the actors as a particular point of interest. They enjoyed the overall comedy of the film and remarked on some of the funniest scenes, emphasizing the humour found in the changing of the presidents gag and the characteristic portrayals of Ed McMahon's character and Kenneth Mars's character. They also found the premise of the protagonist being unable to age due to the werewolf curse intriguing. They appreciated the cast, mentioning the presence of actors like Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, and Demond Wilson. They made a special mention of Alan Arkin, who also plays a part in the film, and recently won an Oscar, expressing a mild sense of wonderment if he remembers co-starring with his sons in this movie. They regard Larry Cohen's flair for horror-comedy, including his other famous film, \\"It's Alive\\", with favorable remembrance.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the information you found about the Series 2009 100 bill redesign and its issuance isn't directly related to your question about who is on the hundred dollar bill. The person featured on the hundred dollar bill is Benjamin Franklin.  Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and is recognized for his diverse expertise in multiple fields, including being a leading writer, printer, political philosopher, politician, Freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. His contributions spanned areas like science, where he is renowned for his experiments with electricity, to public works, where he instituted the concept of a lending library and fire department. As such, his impact on early American society was profound and lasting. In addition to Franklin's portrait on the obverse (front) side of the bill, the backside hosts an illustration of Independence Hall, the historic site where the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were debated and adopted in Philadelphia, a city where Franklin spent much of his life. The 100 bill is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \\"Benjamin\\" due to his portrait's presence. The redesign of the 100 bill in 2009 that you found details on was undertaken to implement advanced security features that would make the bill harder to counterfeit. This included a blue 3-D Security Ribbon and the Bell in the Inkwell feature, but the portrait of Franklin remained the same through the design transition.

Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Every cruise line will be a little different, so seeing the do's and don'ts laid out in black and white can give you a leg up prior to departure.  Some cruise lines may have different dress codes for their dining rooms, lounges, and onboard activities. As a result, you should also be sure to pack the appropriate attire for these occasions; this frequently includes casual clothes, semi-formal options, and formal wear. It is also important to remember that cruise ships often have a range of onboard amenities you may want to bring items for, such as swimming pools (swimwear is essential), fitness centers (athletic wear, socks, and athletic shoes), and spas (comfortable loungewear). For outdoor activities, like shore excursions or engaging in onboard games, pack layers of breathable and comfortable clothing that can be easily adjusted to the changing weather. In addition to clothing, remember to pack essential travel documents such as your passport, booking confirmation, and any necessary visas. Also, it's always a safe bet to bring copies of these important documents, just in case of loss or damage. Moreover, include essential toiletries and medications in your suitcase. While cruise ships may have some available for purchase, it's best to have personal items that you're familiar with and suit your preferences. To save luggage space and avoid potential issues in airport security, pack travel-sized toiletries. Don't forget to bring electronic gadgets, such as your smartphone and camera, as well as the necessary chargers and adapters. Cruise ships offer a variety of onboard activities and picturesque destinations, which you'll definitely want to capture for lasting memories. Lastly, pack a small carry-on bag for embarkation day. This bag should hold your cruise documents, valuables, and items you may need during the first few hours onboard the ship, such as prescription medication, sunscreen, and a change of clothes. Your checked luggage may not immediately arrive at your cabin, so it's best to be prepared for the initial hours of your adventure.

Information:  - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin (  21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets.

In the 1990s , Toon co-chaired the U.S. - Russian Joint Commission on POW / MIAs with Russian general Dmitri Volkogonov . An article about Toon 's briefing of the US press corps in Moscow 1977 - 79 was published in the US State Department 's Foreign Service Journal in June 2011 and may be read at http://www.afsa.org/FSJ/0611/files/assets/downloads/publication.pdf .  - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.  - Yugoslavia (/, ) was a country in Southeast Europe during most of the 20th century. It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia.

International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a highest ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state, or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor. An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy, whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador.  - Jean Mayer (19 February 1920  1 January 1993) was a French-American scientist best known for his research on the physiological bases of hunger and the metabolism of essential nutrients, and for his role in shaping policy on world hunger at both the national and international levels.

By the end of the second month it had left all the clocks and watches of the town far behind. I could do nothing but take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch at once, but he asked me to come in a week's time. When at last I got my watch back from him, it began to slow down. And I failed to be in time for trains, business affairs, and even missed my dinners. Now I went to a third watchmaker. When I was waiting for him to repair my poor watch, he took it to pieces and said that he would try to finish this work in three or four days. What I could do was to nod my head. After that, my watch went for half a day, and then stopped. So I kept taking my watch from one watchmaker to another. But each watchmaker disappointed me.

Ethnic clashes last month left at least 300 people dead and threatened to revive a civil war that has killed tens of thousands. A 12,000-strong UN mission in South Sudan was unable to prevent attacks. The announcement was made by the East African regional body, Igad, and confirmed by South Sudan cabinet minister Dr Martin Elia Lomuro. President Salva Kiir had previously dismissed the idea of an additional force. The proposal for a new unit in South Sudan was backed by the African Union and discussed at a meeting in Ethiopia of Igad - the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. But much of the details of the force remain unclear. Igad sources have suggested a new force should have a more far-reaching mandate than the existing peacekeeping mission. But after the meeting, South Sudan's Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro told the BBC further talks were needed to discuss the mandate, size and timeline for any force. Correspondents say the group of soldiers from different African countries is likely to be modelled on a similar unit deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo to combat rebels from the M23 group. Last week, President Kiir removed Riek Machar as first vice-president, two weeks after the rival leaders' forces clashed in the capital. The two had backed a peace deal signed in the wake of violence in recent years. In the wake of the latest fighting, Mr Machar's spokesman told AFP news agency that \\"the only hope is a protection force\\". The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, reporting from the region, said it was also agreed at the Igad meeting that the newly appointed vice-president, Taban Deng, would step down from his position if Mr Machar agreed to return to Juba to rejoin the transitional government. Mr Machar had previously said he would stay away unless a neutral African force was deployed there. South Sudan became independent from Sudan in 2011 but its short history has been marred by civil war.","output":"South Sudan has agreed to accept the deployment of a 4,000-strong regional protection force in an effort to prevent the outbreak of a full-scale civil war due to escalating ethnic clashes; however, details of the force, backed by the African Union, remain unclear."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Your old toy car could travel 13 miles for every 1 candy. And your new toy car can travel 40 miles for every 1 candy. You want to go on a 50-mile trip with your new toy car. With your new car, it can travel 40 miles with just 1 candy. But you need to go 50 miles, so you need a little more candy to go the extra 10 miles. Now, let's think about how much of a candy we need to travel the extra 10 miles. Your new car can go 40 miles with 1 candy, right? So, to figure out how much candy we need for 10 miles, we simply divide 10 by 40. That gives us 0.25 candy. So, for a 50-mile trip with your new car, you will now require 1 candy (for the first 40 miles) plus 0.25 candy (for the extra 10 miles). That makes a total of 1.25 candies!

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the character who Link believes is not as heartless as he appears?  In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies. Answer:","output":"The full name of the character who Link believes is not as heartless as he appears is David Porter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride. I still tear up every morning when I awaken and see her sleeping beside me. Peace Question: How long did he cry after the second wedding? Answer: A:","output":"It is not explicitly mentioned how long he cried after the second wedding. However, it does mention that he still tears up every morning when he sees his bride sleeping beside him. So, it's impossible to determine an exact duration of his crying after the second wedding, but it's clear that his emotional attachment and love for his bride have continued to provoke tears of happiness regularly since then."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This context implies that Quinn had gone through a potentially tough or extensive negotiation process to reach a point of agreement on the contract's terms and conditions. Now that Quinn has agreed to the contract, it is essential to understand what will happen to them next. Out of the provided options: A: wave his hand - This action does not accurately represent what would happen to Quinn after agreeing to the contract. Waving one's hand is usually a gesture used in greetings, farewells, or attracting attention. It does not have any direct connection to the contract negotiation context. B: sign the contract - This option is the most likely action to follow after agreeing to a contract. Once parties have settled on the contract terms and conditions, it is customary to sign the document as an official acknowledgment and acceptance of the agreed-upon provisions. Signing the contract solidifies the agreement and creates a legally binding commitment between the involved parties. In this case, Quinn agreeing to the contract suggests that they are ready to finalize the agreement, and therefore, signing the contract would be the next logical step. C: stare at the contract - While it is possible that Quinn might momentarily glance or examine the contract after agreeing to it, merely staring at it would not advance the situation or contribute to finalizing the agreement. Although this option acknowledges the contract's presence, it does not indicate any further commitment or action from Quinn regarding the agreement.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons.  He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar.  When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested.  Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever.  After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees.

Newport council claims they have a detrimental impact on communities and can cause problems for neighbours. There are currently 2,516 vacant properties in the city, with 1,142 exempt from council tax because they are undergoing major work. The council hopes the move will urge owners to bring them back into use. Under the plans, the council would charge 200% council tax on properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more. Based on the average annual council tax bill for Band D properties in Newport, between Â£1,149 and Â£1,174 depending on the area, the council could recoup about Â£2,200 per property a year. Of the 1,104 empty homes in the city for which council tax is charged, 755 have been vacant for more than a year. The council already has ways to tackle the issue, such as the Houses into Homes loan scheme. But it hopes the extra premium will discourage long-term disuse while also bringing in more money to help it work with owners to bring properties back into use. As well as improving the quality of life for nearby residents, the authority said the move would help increase the availability of affordable homes. Other councils in Wales have already brought in similar measures to cut the rising number of second homes. Anglesey council voted through a 25% increase while Pembrokeshire agreed a 50% increase from April 2017. The move comes after new powers were introduced by the Welsh Government in March. Residents can have their say on the proposals until 31 October.

Review: Start of with the good bit: several times Swayze talks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. That's a great plus, as normally USA & UK movie audiences think all people on this planet speak English (just in case you're one of them: no they don't). But the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in The Netherlands (it makes your toes curl -and not in a good way). I like Swayze but in this he's awful. The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie -some one must have told him it looks butch. No Patrick: it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co-workers. Her acting is só relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days. And it's not. Your frock was a clue, Alison. The best acting came from the people from the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best.

With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan.

Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - William III (4 November 1650  8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death.

The honey soothes inflamed skin while baking soda works to slough off dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reduce the size of the pimple. To whip up this exfoliant, mix equal parts raw honey and baking soda in a small bowl. Apply the mixture to your deep pimples and gentle exfoliate for a minute or two in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. For the best results, use this exfoliant 2-3 times a week. Oatmeal Exfoliant Oatmeal is famous for its calming and gentle cleansing properties, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive ones. Rich in antioxidants, this exfoliant can help reduce inflammation, redness, and infection associated with deep pimples. To create an oatmeal exfoliant, grind one cup of rolled oats in a blender or food processor until you have a fine powder. Combine this with one cup of warm water and mix well to create a thick paste. Gently massage the mixture onto your deep pimples and leave it for 10-15 minutes before rinsing off with warm water. Repeat the process 2-3 times per week for the best results. Sugar-Olive Oil Exfoliant Sugar and olive oil work together to create a simple yet effective exfoliant that helps reduce inflammation, hydrate the skin and dissolve dead skin cells. The sugar granules provide gentle exfoliation, while olive oil's healthy fats and antioxidants nourish the skin. In a small bowl, combine equal parts granulated sugar and olive oil and mix well. Apply the mixture to your deep pimples and massage gently for 2-3 minutes. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. For optimal results, use this exfoliant once or twice a week. Sea Salt Exfoliant Sea salt carries various minerals like magnesium, calcium, and potassium that are beneficial to skin health. Additionally, sea salt absorbs excess oil, fights off bacteria, and helps to balance the skin's natural pH levels. Consequently, it's an effective natural remedy for deep pimples. To create the sea salt exfoliant, combine two teaspoons of finely ground sea salt with one teaspoon of water and mix well to form a thick paste. Gently massage the mixture into the affected areas in circular motions for a minute or two. Rinse with warm water or a gentle cleanser and pat dry. For best results, use the sea salt exfoliant 2-3 times a week. Conclusion If you are looking to say goodbye to those stubborn deep pimples, incorporating these all-natural exfoliants into your skincare routine may just be the solution. Always do a patch test before applying any new exfoliant to your skin, and if necessary, consult a healthcare professional or dermatologist for tailored advice. Remember, some deep pimples may require medical intervention for safe and effective treatment. Patience, persistence, and a carefully curated skincare routine are the keys to attaining clearer and healthier skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Marc Albrighton has been released by Aston Villa with Premier League newcomers Leicester City his likeliest destination. The winger has been with Villa since he was nine but his contract expired this summer and, as Sportsmail revealed on May 9, the Championship winners are understood to be keen on bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a free transfer. Albrighton, the former England Under-21 international, would receive an improved wage at Leicester with Villa failing to offer fresh terms despite his positive end to the Premier League campaign. Moving on: Marc Albrighton (left) is set to leave Aston Villa for Leicester City after his contract wasn't renewed. Better terms: Albrighton could command a higher salary at Leicester, who have just been promoted to the Premier League. The 24-year-old was sent on loan to Wigan for a month last October, only making four appearances, but returned and was one of the brightest playerâ€™s under Paul Lambert during the survival run-in. Leicester need to strengthen in the wide areas with experienced Lloyd Dyer, 31, looking elsewhere when his contract expires next month. Albrighton matches the profile of players manager Nigel Pearson looks for given his youth, fitness, and level-headedness. He would compete for a starting berth with Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez. Leicester are also poised to bid for Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo. The 18-year-old is an Italy Under 19 international but was born in Chesterfield. Striker Nathan Delfouneso has also been deemed surplus to requirements by Vila boss Paul Lambert. Gone: Nathan Delfouneso (centre) has also left Aston Villa. Lambert said: 'We wish Marc the best in his future career and acknowledge the contribution he has made to the club over the past several years having graduated from our academy.' Delfouneso, another academy graduate who spent last season on loan at Coventry, departs after 50 appearances following his debut, aged 17, in the UEFA Cup tie against Icelandic side FH Hafnarfjorour in August 2008. Lambert added: 'We also wish Nathan the best for his career and thank him for his efforts since he, too, graduated from our academy.'","output":"1.

Does \\"Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an \\"over-elaboration\\" of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin.\\" correctly answer the question of What does this group believe of the story of a Virgin mother for Mary and those who follow its teaching ?","output":"The provided statement does not directly answer the question regarding the belief of Eastern Orthodox Christians on the story of a Virgin mother for Mary and those who follow its teaching. However, the statement does shed light on the Eastern Orthodox perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is related to the broader topic. To provide a detailed understanding of the Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and its significance for followers of the faith, we need to explore the concept of Mary's 'immaculate conception' and its relationship with the doctrines of 'ancestral sin' and 'original sin.' First, let us examine the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the Immaculate Conception refers to the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was conceived without original sin. In other words, the Immaculate Conception teaches that from the moment of her conception, Mary was free from the stain of original sin that affects all human beings. On the other hand, Eastern Orthodox Christianity does not formally accept the dogmatic declaration of the Immaculate Conception. The statement provided explains that contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception because they perceive it as an \\"over-elaboration\\" of the faith and closely connected to a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin. Ancestral sin, in Eastern Orthodox theology, is understood differently from the Western Christian concept of original sin. Ancestral sin emphasizes that human beings inherit the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience, such as death, suffering, and the inclination towards sin, rather than inheriting their guilt. This distinction impacts the Eastern Orthodox view on the need for Mary's Immaculate Conception, as they do not believe that human beings are born guilty of original sin, and therefore, there is no inherent requirement for Mary to be preserved from it. Eastern Orthodox Christians venerate Mary as Theotokos, which means the \\"Mother of God\\" or \\"God-bearer.\\" While they do not hold the specific doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, they still acknowledge and honor Mary's role as a unique and sinless human being chosen to give birth to Jesus Christ. They believe that Mary was prepared by God from her conception to be the mother of Jesus, but they do not explicitly attribute this to her being preserved from the ancestral sin. In conclusion, the provided statement addresses the Eastern Orthodox Christians' perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, but it does not fully answer the question regarding their beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and the significance for those who follow its teaching. According to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Mary is highly venerated as Theotokos, and her sinless nature is acknowledged. However, the Immaculate Conception is not considered an essential doctrine by the Eastern Orthodox Church, as it is related more to the Western Christian understanding of original sin rather than the Eastern doctrine of ancestral sin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"Why could Madonna not adopt?\\"  Context: \\"Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo \\"Mercy\\" James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" along with 34 hits spanning her career. Celebration reached number one in the UK, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history. She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, to speak in tribute to deceased pop star Michael Jackson.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The initial roadblock in Madonna's adoption process came from Malawian law, which stipulates that prospective adoptive parents must be a resident of the country. Madonna, who is not a resident of Malawi, intended to adopt Chifundo \\"Mercy\\" James from the country. Despite the High Court of Malawi initially approving the adoption, they later rejected the application on the basis of her non-residency. This law is typically in place in many countries to ensure the protection and welfare of the child. The belief is that a resident adoptive parent would have a better understanding of the child's cultural and social background. Moreover, it would be easier to assess and monitor the prospective parent's suitability and capacity to adopt. However, international adoptions do occur and are primarily governed by bilateral agreements between countries that can manage and solve these legal and administrative complexities. But for Madonna, this criterion became a temporary barrier to her intended adoption. Unyielding, Madonna decided to appeal against this decision. On June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi reversed the earlier verdict and granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. This success did not only illuminate Madonna's relentless pursuit to grow her family through adoption but also highlighted legal intricacies involved in international adoptions. These challenges didn't seem to have impacted Madonna's career, however. During this period, she released \\"Celebration,\\" her third greatest-hits album and her final release with Warner. The album was a success, reaching number one in the UK, tying her record with Elvis Presley for the most number one albums by a solo act on the British chart. She also appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to pay tribute to the late pop star, Michael Jackson, further demonstrating her resilience and versatility as an artist. Her journey through international adoption, while fraught with obstacles, ended successfully, and added another layer to her multi-faceted public persona."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Answer:","output":"Which statement best describes the use of HGH (Human Growth Hormone) in athletics, according to the article?

The country has vast oil reserves and is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude oil. The petroleum industry is a significant part of the Norwegian economy, with the development and extraction of oil resources mainly carried out by large, international oil companies as well as the state-owned company Equinor (formerly Statoil).  Major oil fields in Norway include the Ekofisk, Statfjord, Oseberg, Troll, and Johan Sverdrup fields. Oil production in these fields is conducted through offshore platforms and subsea installations. After extraction, the oil is transported through a network of pipelines to onshore facilities for processing and export. Additionally, some oil is exported directly from offshore loading facilities.

Write a title for this article: Rolf Harris repeatedly sexually assaulted the daughter of family friends over a period of years, beginning when she was 13 and on holiday, a court has heard. The entertainer and artist, 84, first assaulted the girl in the late 1970s, grooming her \\"like a pet\\" while she was on holiday, Southwark crown court in London was told on Friday. The alleged victim cannot be named for legal reasons. Opening the prosecution case against Harris, Sasha Wass QC called Harris a \\"Jekyll and Hyde character\\", beloved as a children's entertainer but sexually attracted to children, and who used his fame to assault them. \\"Behind this charming and amicable children's entertainer lay a man who exploited these children who were drawn towards him,\\" she said. The first alleged victim was described by Wass as being repeatedly assaulted by Harris over a number of years, saying her status was \\"like a toy\\". The girl began to drink heavily as a teenager to cope, and soon became an alcoholic, the court heard. The first assault, at a hotel, began when the entertainer pretended to hug and tickle her when she emerged from a shower. Wass said: \\"You will see a pattern during this case of Mr Harris approaching girls in a purely friendly way and then, once he is in close physical contact with them, he takes advantage of the situation in order to indecently assault them. \\"The same happened on this occasion. Mr Harris, having made physical contact with [the girl] on the pretext of a hug and a tickle, then wrapped his hands around her and put his hands inside the towel.\\" The alleged victim was stunned, Wass told the court, having previously been in awe of Harris, who was by this time a well-known celebrity. The Australian-born star assaulted the girl again two days later as she was wrapped in a towel on a beach, the jury was told, and did so again during the holiday. He then carried out similar assaults on the girl over the following years, the jury of six men and six women was told. At times the assaults happened even if other people were nearby, Wass said. \\"Maybe that was part of the excitement for him, knowing he could do this and knowing he could get away with it,\\" she said. As a family friend, the alleged victim did not want to disclose what was happening, the jury heard. The assaults left her petrified of Harris, Wass said, and anxious and panicky when Harris socialised with her family. At the age of 14 she began drinking to cope with the assaults, the court heard, and would drink what she described as a \\"shed-load\\" of gin if she knew Harris was due to visit. Wass said: \\"You will have to ask yourself, why would a 14-year-old girl from a happy family background start drinking in this way? She will say she drank in order to block out what was happening.\\" The teenager was repeatedly assaulted by Harris in the bedroom of her family home while her parents were downstairs, Wass said. After two years of such assaults, Wass said, teachers at her school noted a change in the girl's demeanour, as she appeared prone to tears and worried about matters at home. Still, she did not tell anyone about the assaults. Harris was \\"a pillar of society, a well-respected man and someone who was known as being fond of children\\", Wass noted. The teenager said Harris was \\"using her for his own sexual gratification\\", Wass told the court. \\"He never treated her as an equal or a human being. He never had a meaningful conversation with her. She felt she was just his little toy.\\" Harris, wearing a grey suit, pale pink shirt and patterned tie, sat impassive inside the glassed-in dock listening to proceedings on a hearing loop headset. He denies 12 counts of indecent assault of four girls and women, the youngest aged between seven and eight, and the oldest 19, between 1969 and 1994. The jury, sworn in on Thursday, was asked by the trial judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, to exclude themselves if they were likely to be in contact with close friends or family in Australia or New Zealand during the case, as some of the evidence was connected to those countries. He warned them against researching the trial personally, or being influenced by media coverage. The trial is scheduled to last up to seven weeks. Harris, who lives in Bray, Berkshire, was raised in Western Australia before moving to the UK, where he forged a career in television, music and art. Much of his work has been based around introducing young people to art or interpreting a broad version of Australian culture for an overseas audience, as with his trademark pop hit, Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He is also an artist and painted a portrait of the Queen in 2005.","output":"\\"Rolf Harris: The Dark Side of a Beloved Children's Entertainer Revealed in Court\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Clearly if we are to participate in the society in which we live, we must communicate with other people. A great deal of communicating is performed on a person-to-person basis by the simple means of speech. If we travel in buses, buy things in shops, or eat in restaurants, we are likely to have conversations where we give information or opinions, receive news or comment, and very likely to have our views challenged by other members of society. Face to face contact is by no means the only form of communication and during the last two hundred years the art of mass communication has become one of the dominating factors of contemporary society. Two things, above others, have caused the enormous growth of the communication industry. Firstly, inventiveness has led to advanced imprinting, telecommunications photography, radio and television. Secondly, speed has revolutionized the transmission   and reception of communications so that local news often takes a back seat to national news, which itself is often almost eclipsed( ) by international news. No longer is the possession of information confined to  a privileged minority. In the last century the wealthy man with his own library was indeed fortunate, but today there are public libraries. For years ago people used to flock to the cinema, but now far more people sit at home and turn on the TV to watch a programme that is being channeled into millions of homes. Communication is no longer merely concerned with the transmission of information. The modem communication industry influences the way people live in society and broadens their horizons by allowing access to information, education and entertainment. The printing, broadcasting and advertising industries are all involved with informing, educating and entertaining.

Some of our preferences are clearly psychological.Dark blue is the color of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color connected with energy and encouragement.Experiments have shown that colors, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind.People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure.Red is exciting.Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color.Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a closer study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow colors that stop buses, trucks and cars.

Maria liked to plan their actions out.; B). Monica liked to plan their actions out.;","output":"Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because Maria liked to plan their actions out. This approach allowed her to establish a sense of direction and purpose in her life, whereas Monica opted for a more spontaneous and go-with-the-flow attitude, which sometimes led her to be indecisive and uncertain about the future. Maria's preference for carefully plotted plans stemmed from her innate desire to be in control of her life's trajectory. This meticulous approach allowed her to set realistic objectives and assign herself the necessary time to work towards these long-term goals. The process of mapping out her intentions gave Maria the opportunity to reflect on the potential challenges she might encounter, as well as the necessary resources and skills she needed to acquire to overcome them. By contrast, Monica embraced the unpredictability of life and often found comfort in not knowing what lay ahead. This mindset allowed her to adapt and respond to new situations and opportunities that came her way. Monica believed that being too rigid in her planning could hinder her ability to seize unexpected sources of happiness and success. However, her inclination towards spontaneity could lead to feelings of disorientation and make her more prone to taking impulsive decisions that might not always result in the best outcomes. The distinction in their goal-setting styles was evident in how Maria and Monica approached their careers. Maria, being systematic and methodical in her planning, knew exactly what steps she needed to take to climb the corporate ladder. She identified opportunities for professional growth and made strategic choices that led her to reach her desired career landmarks. Meanwhile, Monica was content with allowing her career path to unfold organically, trusting her instincts and talents to guide her to the right positions. However, it is important to note that neither Maria nor Monica's approaches were inherently superior to the other. Instead, their preferences for how they set and pursued their goals were a reflection of their unique personalities and personal values. Maria's structured and goal-oriented mindset gave her the stability and sense of accomplishment she needed to feel fulfilled, while Monica's more flexible and adaptive approach to life let her explore new experiences and opportunities that she might have otherwise missed. In the end, what worked for Maria did not necessarily work for Monica, and vice versa. The key lesson from their contrasting goal-setting habits is that one must know oneself and find the balance between the two approaches that resonates best with their personality traits and individual aspirations. By acknowledging and embracing our preferences, we can tailor our personal and professional goals to our individual needs, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translation is perhaps the most obvious task in our increasingly global and interconnected world, a task that machines, particularly AI systems, have demonstrated significant proficiency at. Translating from English to German, as in this case, involves an understanding of the syntactic and semantic intricacies of both languages. Starting with the original English sentence, \\"This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, whether it be on 75% or whatever,\\" a direct translation into German would be \\"Dies würde uns die Möglichkeit geben, eine Vereinbarung mit dem Rat im Vermittlungsverfahren zu erreichen, ob es sich um 75% oder was auch immer handelt.\\" As can be seen, the sentence structure and construction remains largely similar, although some words have moved around within the sentence. Breaking down the sentence further, \\"This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement\\" translates to \\"Dies würde uns die Möglichkeit geben, eine Vereinbarung zu erreichen\\", \\"with the Council in the conciliation procedure\\" translates to \\"mit dem Rat im Vermittlungsverfahren\\", and \\"whether it be on 75% or whatever\\" translates to \\"ob es sich um 75% oder was auch immer handelt\\". It's essential to keep in mind while translating that even the best translation systems still sometimes get things slightly wrong, generally due to the context, subtlety, and nuances present within each language. As such, while the above translation should be accurate and communicates the same overall idea as the original English sentence, it might not capture every subtlety present within the English version.

As a former military general, Yudhoyono held significant sway in the nation's politics and was poised to contribute to the country's development through new policies and initiatives. His victory would also potentially alter Indonesia's relationships with other countries and international organizations, further emphasizing the significance of this event for the broader world. Conversely, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was then the incumbent president, was facing the prospect of losing her position in office. Her performance and policies during her tenure would have had repercussions on various aspects of Indonesia's society, economy, and politics, which could be a factor in the voters' decision to support Yudhoyono.

Tässä esimerkissä painotetaan sitä, että tietyissä tilanteissa ja olosuhteissa yhteistyö muiden maiden tai organisaatioiden kanssa on rajoitettava ja vastuullista. Erityisesti tarkastelun aiheena ovat erityistuomioistuinten tai sotilastuomioistuinten kanssa tehty yhteistyö sekä luovuttamista kohtaan sovelletut rajoitukset. Ensinnäkin erityistuomioistuimet ja sotilastuomioistuimet eivät usein tarjoa samanlaista oikeusturvaa kuin siviilituomioistuimet, eikä niiden toiminnassa välitetä samassa määrin kansainvälisistä ihmisoikeusnormeista. Tällaisissa tapauksissa on välttämätöntä noudattaa varovaisuusperiaatetta ja olla tekemättä yhteistyötä noiden toimielinten kanssa, jotta oikeudenmukaisuus ja ihmisoikeuksien kunnioittaminen varmistetaan. Toiseksi luovuttaminen tilanteessa, jossa henkilöä uhkaa kuolemanrangaistus, on vastoin kansainvälisen humanitaarisen oikeuden ja periaatteiden periaatteita. Monet maat ja kansainväliset järjestöt, kuten Euroopan unioni, vastustavat kuolemanrangaistusta ja pyrkivät vaikuttamaan sen lakkauttamiseen maailmanlaajuisesti.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Diaghilev turned to? , can you please find it?   During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"The name of the person that Diaghilev turned to is Pierre Monteux. Diaghilev, the founder of Ballets Russes, approached Monteux to conduct Stravinsky's \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" despite Monteux's initial negative reaction to the piece."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive. Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film. There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess. Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it. I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence... Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 - May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the United States in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion. He is known for alleging that numerous Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government, universities, film industry, and elsewhere. Ultimately, the smear tactics that he used led him to be censured by the U.S. Senate. McCarthy was born in 1908 on a farm in the Town of Grand Chute in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, the fifth of seven children. His mother, Bridget (Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States of America, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and graduated in one year.  He attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. McCarthy worked his way through college, studying first electrical engineering for two years, then law, and receiving an LL.B. degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.  McCarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935. While working at a law firm in Shawano, Wisconsin, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a Democrat in 1936. In 1939, McCarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th District circuit judge. (During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.)  McCarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the state's history by defeating incumbent Edgar V. Werner, who had been a judge for 24 years. In the campaign, McCarthy exaggerated Werner's age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office. Writing of Werner in Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America, Ted Morgan wrote: \\"Pompous and condescending, he was disliked by lawyers. He had been reversed often by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases.\\"  McCarthy's judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case. What did he do after high school","output":"After high school, Joseph McCarthy attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. He worked his way through college, studying electrical engineering for two years and then law, ultimately receiving an LL.B. degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Don't waste your money Product review: I have never written a review before, but I feel I need to alert people so they don't waste money or ruin their ceilings and woodwork. I bought this because it was marked down. It looked pretty nifty. I would be even more disappointed if I had paid full price. I ended up having to go out and buy tape anyway because this is a horrible product. A metal edge scrapes paint off your woodwork and the ceiling line is horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake I did. Buy the Shur-Line Premium Paint Edger for a great and cheap ceiling edger and tape your woodwork. This product is also messy and has way too many parts that need to be replaced with subsequent paint projects. Answer:","output":"This review would decrease the chances of me buying the product.  Step 1: Analyze the review's tone and content. The tone of the review is negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment with the product. They mention issues like scraped paint, a poor ceiling line, messiness, and too many replaceable parts. Step 2: Consider reviewer's experience and credibility. The reviewer claims they have never written a review before, and they took the time to write this one to alert others about the product's flaws. This indicates that their experience was negative enough to motivate them to help others avoid the same disappointment. Step 3: Weigh the reviewer's specific complaints. The reviewer outlines several specific issues with the product, including scraping paint off woodwork, poor performance on ceilings, and the need to replace parts for future projects. These issues can be significant drawbacks for potential buyers who are looking for efficient and effective paint edgers. Step 4: Assess alternative recommendation. The reviewer recommends a different product (Shur-Line Premium Paint Edger) as a better alternative, suggesting that they had a positive experience with it. This provides a potential alternative option for the buyer. Conclusion: Based on the negative tone, specific complaints, and the reviewer's credibility, this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Additionally, the provided alternative makes it easier to consider another option without risking the same issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: Scottish Prison Service bosses had earlier told Kenneth Smith at the Court of Session that they would not open his confidential correspondence. However, the message was not passed on to guards at HMP Glenochil, who opened a letter addressed to him. Lord Pentland found ministers in contempt, but imposed no punishment. Smith had originally gone to the Court of Session after privileged letters from the Information Commissioners Office and Risk Management Authority sent to him at HMP Dumfries and HMP Edinburgh were opened between December 2010 and September 2012. The Scottish Prison Service gave an undertaking to the court that they would stop opening Smith's mail. However, when he was transferred to Glenochil in Clackmannanshire in December 2013, staff there were not informed of the undertaking. One guard opened a letter sent to Smith from the Risk Management Authority, and the inmate took the matter back to court. At the hearing at the Court of Session, the Scottish ministers admitted breaching the undertaking. Lord Pentland said it was clear that Glenochil staff should have been informed of the agreement. He said: \\"I consider that the failure to take that elementary and obvious step was so gross a nature as to demonstrate a disregard for the importance which the prison service should have attached to the undertaking. \\"In these circumstances I am driven to the conclusion that the admitted breach of the undertaking constituted a contempt of court. \\"I agree that no penalty should be imposed. The finding of contempt of court against the Scottish ministers is in itself sufficient to mark the gravity of the failure to honour the undertaking given to the court.\\"","output":"Scottish Prison Service failed to communicate an agreement to not open inmate Kenneth Smith's confidential correspondence, leading to guards at HMP Glenochil opening a letter addressed to him. The Court had previously been given an undertaking that Smith's mail would not be opened, but when he was transferred to Glenochil, staff there were not informed of the agreement. As a result, Scottish ministers were found in contempt of court, but no penalty was imposed, as the contempt finding itself marked the gravity of the failure to honor the undertaking."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the sentence \\"A man is accepting a check.\\", is the sentence \\"The man took the check off the counter.\\" a true sentence?","output":"In order to analyze the relationship between these two sentences and determine the validity of the second statement, we need to have a clear understanding of both sentences and look into their contexts. First sentence: \\"A man is accepting a check.\\" This sentence describes a situation where a man is receiving a check from someone, possibly as a form of payment or as a gift. The check is most likely handed over to the man, and he accepts it willingly. Second sentence: \\"The man took the check off the counter.\\" In this sentence, it appears that the check is on a counter, and the man in question picks it up or takes possession of it. It implies a slightly different action compared to the first sentence, because here the check is not being handed over to the man directly but is picked up by him from the counter. Based on the presented information, it cannot be definitively stated that the second sentence is true, as it may or may not be an accurate representation of the situation. There are a few reasons for this: 1. Contextual difference: The first sentence involves the man accepting the check, while the second suggests that the check is on a counter, and the man takes it off from there. These two scenarios don't necessarily align, as the check could be handed over to the man directly in the first sentence. 2. Ambiguity: Without any further context or clarification, it is difficult to determine if the two sentences are referring to the same situation, the same man, or even the same check. It is possible that the second sentence refers to a completely different scenario involving a different man and check. 3. Time and action: The first sentence depicts a man actively accepting a check, whereas the second sentence describes the man's action of physically removing a check from a counter. There could be a progression of events where the first sentence occurs, and later on, the man puts the check on the counter momentarily, then picks it up again, making the second sentence true. However, there is no evidence provided to support such a link between the two sentences. In conclusion, while it is possible that both sentences could be true in the same context, there is not enough information provided to assert that \\"The man took the check off the counter\\" is a true sentence based solely on \\"A man is accepting a check.\\" Further context or details are necessary to make a definitive judgment on the validity of the second statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The initial statement specified that Jason's children are less independent compared to Derrick's. This indicates that Jason's children might require more guidance and supervision, implying that Jason should be more actively involved in their upbringing. 2. Applying the information logically, if Jason's children are less independent then it simplifies that they might need more direct help from him. This leads organically to the statement that Jason must take a hands on approach with his children. 3. Unless there's a context suggesting otherwise, it would not make sense to say that Derrick needs to take on a more hands-on approach with his children as we've been told they are already quite independent.

Despite this setback, the two friends remained determined to find a suitable pair of shoes for Craig, understanding that his struggle was not an uncommon one. They decided to embark on a thorough search that would take them to numerous shoe stores in the area, each offering a unique variety of options. As they ventured from one retailer to the next, Craig began to grow dispirited with the lack of sizes catering to individuals with wider feet. He began to lament his circumstances, feeling a sense of isolation and frustration. However, Derrick refused to let his friend's spirits dampen. He insisted on continuing the hunt and suggested they explore alternative options, such as online stores or considering custom-made footwear. During their search, the duo stumbled upon a small, family-owned business specializing in comfortable shoes for individuals with uncommon feet sizes and shapes. Their excitement grew as they browsed through the unique collection of footwear specifically designed for customers like Craig. The store owner, having experienced a similar problem in the past, boasted a diverse assortment of stylish yet functional options tailored to meet the needs of people who struggle to find properly fitting shoes. As Craig tried on different pairs, he was amazed at the level of comfort and support that these shoes offered. He had never experienced such a perfectly fitting shoe in his life, and his joy was palpable. Derrick, who had always witnessed Craig's struggle with footwear, was equally elated to see his friend finally able to find suitable shoes. Their perseverance had ultimately paid off. Upon purchasing the triumphant pair of shoes, Craig and Derrick left the store with a newfound appreciation for small businesses that cater to niche markets. They acknowledged the importance of not giving up when faced with difficulties and were proud of their determination in finding a solution. It was a testament to their friendship that they were able to overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle together. From that day forward, Craig's perspective on shoe shopping had transformed significantly. He no longer dreaded the idea of searching for new footwear, knowing that there were places he could turn to for assistance. Both he and Derrick now actively advocated for the importance of supporting local, specialized businesses that made it their mission to cater to the needs of often-overlooked customers. Ultimately, the success of their day at the shoe store marked a new beginning for Craig and Derrick. Not only did they walk away with the perfect pair of shoes for each of them, but they also acquired valuable life lessons and a reinforced sense of camaraderie.

Summarize the following: If you plan to add new wires or a light switches that to an existing kitchen outlet, make sure the electrical box that houses the outlet has enough room. You will have to replace the box with a larger one if it doesn’t. Use the National Electrical Code to determine the size of the electrical box. Calculate the amount of wires, devices, and clamps you will put in the box. Add 1 cubic inch for each hot and neutral wire, 2 cubic inches for each device (such as a switch), 1 cubic inch for all ground wires, and 1 cubic inch for all clamps. Take this sum and multiply it by either 2 for 14-gauge wire or 2.25 for 12-gauge wire. This calculation will give you the minimum box requirement in cubic inches. You do not have to do calculations for plastic boxes as the volume is stamped inside of them. Do this at the circuit breaker. Find the switch labeled kitchen and make sure it’s off. Test to see if the power is turned off, plug in a device such as a lamp or radio into the outlet and see if it turns on.  You can also use a receptacle tester on the outlet. The lights on the test will come on if any power still running into the outlet. While the circuit breaker may be labeled, make sure you test the outlet anyway. There may have been changes in the wiring since the box was installed, or the wiring may be defective. First, unscrew the wall plate that holds the outlet. Then, unscrew the outlet from the electrical box. Take the outlet out and disconnect any wires that are connected to it. The electrical box is nailed to a wall stud. Look around the electrical box to determine which side the stud is on. Use a flashlight if it’s too dark to see. You don’t want to saw through the stud when you are expanding the hole to hold new electrical box. Hold the new electrical box over the existing box in the wall so the expansion of the hole is on the side that isn’t nailed to a stud. Use a pencil to make an outline of where you will cut with the drywall saw. Make sure that any wiring connected to the old electrical box is loose before removing it. Pulling out the box when the wires are tight will damage the wiring. Once you are sure that wires are loose, remove the old box by using a flat pry bar.","output":"Before adding new wires or light switches to a kitchen outlet, ensure there is enough room in the electrical box.

Which entity is this text about? Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, California, the eldest son of Audree Neva (nee Korthof) and Murry Wilson. His two younger brothers were Dennis and Carl. He has English, Swedish, Dutch, German, and Irish ancestry.  When Brian was two, the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California. Speaking of Brian's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from \\"When the Caissons Go Rolling Along\\" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, \\"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\\" At about age two, Brian heard George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which had an enormous emotional impact on him. A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially deaf to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame.  While Brian's father Murry was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he was often abusive. A minor musician and songwriter, he also encouraged his children in this field in numerous ways. At an early age, Brian was given six weeks of lessons on a \\"toy accordion\\" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him. At Hawthorne High School, Brian was on the football team as a quarterback, played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year. He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of the Four Freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph, then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard. He received a Wollensak tape recorder on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.  Surviving home tapes document his initial efforts singing with various friends and family. In his senior year at Hawthorne High, in addition to classroom music studies, he sang at lunch time with friends like Keith Lent and Bruce Griffin. Brian and Keith worked on a revised version of the tune \\"Hully Gully\\" to support the campaign of a classmate named Carol Hess when she ran for senior class president. Enlisting his cousin and frequent singing partner Mike Love as well as his own brother Carl, Brian's next public performance featured more ambitious arrangements at a fall arts program at his high school. To entice Carl into the group, Brian named the newly formed membership Carl and the Passions. The performance featured tunes by Dion and the Belmonts and the Four Freshmen (\\"It's a Blue World\\"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Brian in the audience that night, Al Jardine, who would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.

Throughout the review, Stephen repeatedly emphasizes his dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie, criticizing its content, effects on his grandchildren, and suggesting that the filmmakers should be held accountable.  The review begins with a bold statement, as Stephen claims that it is the worst children's film he has ever seen in his entire life. This sets a strong negative tone for the rest of the review, indicating that his experience was severely unfavorable. Additionally, he notes that his grandchildren, the intended target audience, could not even enjoy the movie, stressing the film's failure to achieve its primary purpose—entertaining children. One major concern Stephen raises is the presence of tasteless sexual innuendoes throughout the film, which he finds inappropriate for a children's movie. He postpones discussing the matter, suggesting that their distasteful nature deserves its own discussion. His critique of this particular aspect further emphasizes his negative perception of the film. Stephen concludes his review by emphasizing that the film is \\"truly, truly awful,\\" leaving no room for doubt about his feelings. He also expresses frustration and disappointment that the movie spoiled the time he spent with his grandchildren, highlighting the emotional impact of his negative experience.

Write an article using the following points: Under government's proposed changes to Medicare the average upfront cost of a 15-minute consultation with a GP could exceed 100 in two years. 'We're predicting a rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor,' says Doctors Reform Society national president. About 82 per cent of GP visits are bulk-billed. For patients who pay privately, the average out-of-pocket cost is 30.","output":"Title: The Impact of Proposed Changes to Medicare on the Cost of GP Consultations Introduction:  The Australian government's proposed changes to Medicare could potentially see the average upfront cost of a 15-minute consultation with a General Practitioner (GP) skyrocket to over 100 in just two years. With affordability being a significant concern for many families, the question of how these changes will impact access to healthcare has become increasingly vital. In this article, we will explore the potential ramifications of the proposed changes on both bulk-billed and private GP visits, as well as the concerns expressed by the Doctors Reform Society. Step 1: Presenting current statistics To establish a clear understanding of the current state of affairs, one should consider that approximately 82 per cent of GP visits are bulk-billed, meaning that Medicare covers the cost of the visit in full. As for the remaining percentage of patients, they opt for a private payment, which has an average out-of-pocket expenditure of 30. Step 2: Discussing the impact of changes on bulk billing With the proposed changes to Medicare, there is a concern that the bulk-billing rates will decline. As a result, a larger proportion of patients will have to bear the burden of increased out-of-pocket costs. This development may lead to financial strain for families and individuals who rely on affordable access to healthcare services. Step 3: Highlighting the predictions of the Doctors Reform Society As stated by the Doctors Reform Society's national president, there could be a \\"rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor.\\" This situation will undoubtedly affect many Australians' accessibility to healthcare services. Moreover, it may result in the delay of essential preventative care and early treatment of illnesses, which ultimately can lead to more severe health issues down the line. Step 4: Delving into the effects on private patients For the 18 per cent of patients who already pay privately for their GP visits, the proposed Medicare changes may result in an even more significant increase in out-of-pocket expenses. Taking into account inflation and surging costs, this could severely impact those who already struggle to afford healthcare services, pushing some to forego healthcare altogether. Step 5: Concluding remarks In conclusion, the Australian government's proposed changes to Medicare could have far-reaching consequences for both bulk-billed and private patients. With the cost of a 15-minute GP consultation predicted to rise exponentially in just two years, both accessibility to healthcare services and the overall health of the nation may be compromised. To safeguard the well-being of Australians, it is crucial to assess the potential implications of these changes and implement necessary safeguards to ensure equitable access to essential healthcare services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What nowdays electrification systems can use?","output":"Nowadays, electrification systems can use a combination of AC (Alternating Current) energy from a power grid and DC (Direct Current) voltage for traction motors in locomotives. Both DC and 3-phase AC motors can be employed in these systems, with 3-phase AC motors necessitating further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC using power electronics. The main task in these electrification systems is converting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive while minimizing energy losses during transmission and conversion. This includes ohmic losses in wires, power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers, and smoothing reactors (inductors). The conversion of electric energy in a DC system usually takes place in a railway substation, where larger, heavier, and more efficient hardware can be utilized. In contrast, an AC system requires conversion onboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Additional energy consumption for cooling purposes, such as blowing air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware, must also be considered in relation to energy efficiency. In summary, modern electrification systems can use both AC and DC power sources, with the main focus on minimizing energy losses and maximizing efficiency during the conversion and transmission of electrical energy. This involves utilizing DC systems with energy conversion in railway substations, aiming to reduce electrical losses in various components and limiting energy consumption for cooling purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection.  Paragraph: Two ancient continents both had a great bird population. At some point in time, the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years. The other continent, Lemuria, was unaffected by the drought.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought? Answer:","output":"Lemuria Justification: As stated in the background information, a drought results in fewer seeds, causing small-beaked birds (which can only eat smaller seeds) to die in larger numbers as compared to the big-beaked birds. However, the paragraph mentions that while the continent of MU had a great drought, Lemuria did not experience the drought. Therefore, since there was no drought in Lemuria, it implies that seed availability was not affected, and so the small-beaked birds would not have died in large numbers due to lack of food. Hence, it can be concluded that Lemuria had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sidney Crosby out indefinitely with broken jaw, Pittsburgh Penguins star was hit in mouth by puck in win over Islanders PITTSBURGH — Sidney Crosby has a broken jaw and is out indefinitely after being hit in the mouth with a puck during a win against the New York Islanders on Saturday. The Pittsburgh Penguins said on the team website Sunday that Crosby had surgery Saturday night, and there will be an update on his status later in the week. Crosby, the NHL’s leading scorer, was struck in the face during the first period of the Penguins’ 2-0 win. Slow-motion replays showed multiple teeth flying out of his mouth after the puck struck him during his first shift. The team said Crosby had “major dental work” and will have more done later in the week. The Penguins have won 15 straight games, and next play Buffalo on Tuesday. Crosby has 56 points (15 goals, 41 assists) and holds a 10-point lead in the scoring race. He has not missed a game yet this season after being limited to 22 regular-season games over the prior two calendar years because of concussion-like symptoms and neck issues after absorbing big hits in consecutive games Jan. 1 and Jan. 5, 2011. Midway through his comeback season, Crosby said he was feeling so good he “doesn’t even think about” the risk of concussion or head or neck injury anymore after two years in which it dominated his life. Teammates expressed similar sentiments. After Saturday’s game, coach Dan Bylsma did not rule out the possibility Crosby would undergo evaluation for a concussion. “I think every time that type of thing happens to a player you think of that,” Bylsma said. “It doesn’t matter who it is. ... You think about those things regardless of the player, yes.” There is no indication, however, that Crosby sustained a concussion and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, citing unidentified sources, reported Crosby is free of concussion symptoms. Led by Crosby, the NHL’s leading MVP candidate as this lockout-abbreviated season, the Penguins (28-8) have a league-best 56 points and have opened up a seven-point lead on the Montreal Canadiens atop the Eastern Conference on Saturday. The playoffs are scheduled to begin April 30. After a shot from teammate Brooke Orpik deflected off an Islanders player Saturday, an unsuspecting Crosby was struck as he faced away from the net while standing low and to the inside of the left-wing circle. Crosby immediately collapsed to the ice, his stick flying out of his hand. A pool of blood formed on the ice before training staff came out. Crosby, who wears a visor that covers the top third of his face, soon left the ice, retreating into the locker room under his own power. The accident overshadowed not only the Pittsburgh’s 15th consecutive victory — only one winning streak in NHL history has been longer — but also the Penguins debut of Jarome Iginla. Acquired via a trade with the Calgary Flames early Thursday morning, Iginla said players on the Penguins’ bench were talking and asking about the condition of their captain during the game. “Very tough,” Iginla said. “Very unfortunate play. Seeing on the replay, he didn’t see it coming at all.” . Crosby won the Hart (MVP) and Art Ross (scoring champion) trophies as a 19-year-old in 2006-07 and shared the Rocket Richard (goal leader) with Steven Stamkos in 2009-10. He became the youngest captain lead his team to the Stanley Cup in 2009.

Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before.

A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   carbon fiber–epoxy and boron fiber–epoxy composites. Compared with metals, these materials are 25%– 50% lighter and thus reduce operating costs. Similarly, the space shuttle payload bay doors and panels are made of a carbon fiber–epoxy composite. The structure of the Boeing 787 has been described as essentially one giant macromolecule, where everything is fastened through cross-linked chemical bonds reinforced with carbon fiber. Metal-matrix composites consist of metals or metal alloys reinforced with fibers. They offer significant advantages for high-temperature applications but pose major manufacturing challenges. For example, obtaining a uniform distribution and alignment of the reinforcing fibers can be difficult, and because organic polymers cannot survive the high temperatures of molten metals, only fibers composed of boron, carbon, or ceramic (such as silicon carbide) can be used. Aluminum alloys reinforced with boron fibers are used in the aerospace industry, where their strength and lightweight properties make up for their relatively high cost. The skins of hypersonic aircraft and structural units in the space shuttle are made of metal-matrix composites. Ceramic-matrix composites contain ceramic fibers in a ceramic matrix material. A typical example is alumina reinforced with silicon carbide fibers. Combining the two very high-melting-point materials results in a composite that has excellent thermal stability, great strength, and corrosion resistance, while the SiC fibers reduce brittleness and cracking. Consequently, these materials are used in very hightemperature applications, such as the leading edge of wings of hypersonic airplanes and jet engine parts. They are also used in the protective ceramic tiles on the space shuttle, which contain short fibers of pure SiO2 mixed with fibers of an aluminum–boron–silicate ceramic.

With more cake deposited, the filtering surface may become clogged, reducing the flow velocity. This contradicts the statement, so option 1 is incorrect. Option 2 states that the flow velocity is directly proportional to the materials in suspension. When more suspended materials are present, the filter surface may become occupied faster, causing a decrease in flow velocity. Therefore, option 2 is also incorrect. Option 3 claims that the flow velocity depends on the ionization degree of the substances being filtered. The ionization degree could affect the interaction between particles and the filter, but it has no direct relation to the flow velocity. So option 3 is incorrect.

Question 2: What is the difference between rankine cycle and modified rankine cycle? pick from the following.  A). no.  B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"A). No. The two questions are not asking the same thing; they are related but cover different aspects of the Rankine cycle in comparison to the Carnot cycle and its modification. Let me provide detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Why is a Rankine cycle used rather than Carnot cycle in the standard cycle? The Rankine cycle is widely used in power plants and other heat engines due to several practical advantages over the Carnot cycle: 1. Realistic temperature-entropy curve: The Rankine cycle considers the actual temperature-entropy curve for the working fluid, making it more realistic. The Carnot cycle, on the other hand, assumes an ideal gas with a constant specific heat capacity, which is not the case in real-life applications. 2. Saturation temperature: In the Carnot cycle, heat is added and rejected at constant temperatures. However, in Rankine cycle, heat is added at a constant pressure, which ensures the working fluid stays below saturation temperature throughout the process. This prevents any damage or inconvenience in handling due to excessive temperature. 3. Simplicity: The Rankine cycle is simpler in design, as it consists of four basic components: a boiler, a turbine, a condenser, and a pump. The Carnot cycle, in contrast, requires isothermal compression and expansion, which is difficult to achieve in practical applications because of complex heat exchanger designs and heat transfer considerations. 4. Condenser pressure: The Rankine cycle allows the working fluid to condense at a higher pressure than the Carnot cycle, reducing the size and cost of the heat exchanger, as well as improving the overall thermal efficiency of the cycle. 5. Range of working fluids: The Rankine cycle can accommodate a wide range of working fluids, including water, organic fluids, and others. This flexibility allows it to be used in various applications and power generation systems. The Carnot cycle is limited in this regard, as it requires an ideal gas for its operation. Question 2: What is the difference between Rankine cycle and Modified Rankine cycle? The main difference between the Rankine cycle and the modified Rankine cycle lies in the modifications made to improve the cycle's efficiency or adapt it to different environments and operating conditions. Some key differences include: 1. Reheat cycle: In a modified Rankine cycle, the working fluid is reheated after partial expansion in the turbine. This reheating process increases the average temperature at which heat is added to the cycle, leading to improved thermal efficiency. This is particularly useful in large power plants where dealing with low-quality steam could cause erosion or damage to turbine blades. 2. Regenerative cycle: Another modification of the Rankine cycle is the introduction of a regeneration process, which involves extracting steam from the turbine at an intermediate stage and using it to preheat the feedwater before it enters the boiler. This results in a higher overall temperature in the cycle, improving thermal efficiency. 3. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC): The organic Rankine cycle is essentially a modified Rankine cycle that utilizes an organic working fluid, such as hydrocarbons or refrigerants, instead of water. ORC systems are well-suited to low-temperature heat sources, such as geothermal or waste heat recovery applications. These modifications to the Rankine cycle aim to improve its overall performance, adaptability, and suitability in various practical applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... Why did Anna continue answering the door? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. Because Girolama threatened to disown her  C.

Information:  - Ur (Sumerian: \\"Urim\\"; Sumerian Cuneiform: or ; Akkadian: \\"Uru\\") was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate. Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland, south of the Euphrates on its right bank, 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Nasiriyah.  - Meskalamdug ( \`\` hero of the good land '' ) was an early ruler ( ensi ) of Ur who does not appear in the Sumerian king list . His tomb , discovered by English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley in the Royal Cemetery of Ur in 1924 , contained numerous gold artifacts including a golden helmet with an inscription of the king 's name . His wife 's name was queen Ninbanda . Meskalamdug was also mentioned on a seal in another tomb with the title lugal ( king ) , however because his own tomb lacked attendants , Woolley assumed that he was not royal . The controversy remains though , because he is named on a bead inscription discovered in Mari by French archaeologist André Parrot ten years later , as the father of king Mesannepada of Ur , who appears in the king list and in many other inscriptions .  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Akkadian (\\"akkadû\\", ak-ka-du-u; logogram: URI ) is an extinct East Semitic language (part of the greater Afroasiatic language family) that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The earliest attested Semitic language, it used the cuneiform writing system, which was originally used to write the unrelated Ancient Sumerian, a language isolate. The language was named after the city of Akkad, a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire (ca. 23342154 BC), but the language itself precedes the founding of Akkad by many centuries.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Dhi Qar Governorate is a governorate in southern Iraq. The provincial capital is Nasiriyah. Prior to 1976 the governorate was known as Muntafiq Governorate. Dhi Qar was the heartland of the ancient Iraqi civilization of Sumer, and includes the ruins of Ur, Eridu, Lagash, Larsa, Girsu, Umma, and Bad-tibira. The southern area of the governorate is covered by Mesopotamian Marshes.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.    What is the relationship between 'meskalamdug' and 'sovereign'? A:","output":"Meskalamdug was an early ruler (ensi) of the ancient Sumerian city-state of Ur. A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories.

Today, we are going to learn about a disease called polio and about the big job doctors and scientists around the world are doing to make sure no one gets this disease again.  So, what is polio? Polio is a very serious illness that can make it hard for people to move their bodies, sometimes it can even make it impossible for them to move at all - we call this paralysis. It was once very common all over the world, but today it's something we hardly ever see, thanks to a special medicine called a vaccine.  Imagine a superhero movie, where the vaccine is the superhero that uses its superpowers to protect us from the bad guy - which, in this case, is polio! Because of this superhero, polio has been kicked out from most parts of the world. It's like when your favorite superhero defeats the villain and the town is safe again. But, not all parts of the world are safe yet. There are three places - Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria - where polio is still hiding. These places are like the final boss levels in a video game. They're the toughest challenges that our heroes - the doctors, scientists and health workers - are facing in the battle against polio. Why is polio still in these places? Well, doctors and scientists are still figuring that out. It might be because it's really hard to make sure every single person in these places gets the superhero vaccine.

They're working day and night, doing everything they can think of, to make sure everyone, everywhere, is safe from polio, just like in your favorite superhero movie where the hero never gives up, no matter what.

A good approach could be to start with the name of the place, followed by its location, the type of food it serves, its price range, and finally, its customer rating. Step 3: Formulating the Sentence Following the aforementioned structure, a possible way to combine this information would be: \\"The Phoenix is an Italian restaurant located in the city centre, it has a moderate price range and has earned a customer rating of 3 out of 5.\\" Justifying My Steps: In representing the given data in a single sentence, it was important to create a clear and logical structure that would allow the reader to easily understand each piece of information. Starting with the name and location of the place provides context. Then, the type of food it serves and the price range indicate what a customer can expect in terms of dining experience. The customer rating was inserted at the end as it provides an overall assessment of the place. This structure is both common and efficient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What piece was composed as a tribute to Albert Libon?  For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an... A:","output":"Messe de Requiem was composed by Saint-Saëns in memory of his friend Albert Libon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: To determine the answer to the question, it is essential to first understand the context in which the division of the territory is taking place. The provided information highlights that two-fifths of the state's territory was divided, but the number of families that shared this portion needs to be calculated. To generate a detailed and long response to the question, it is crucial to dive deeper into the underlying issues, including the possible implications of such a division and the historical context that led to this occurrence. This analysis could potentially shed light on the socioeconomic and political environment at the time of the division. The division of two-fifths of the state's territory among families may stem from historical claims to the land, including legal title ownership or inheritance. Factors that come into play while determining these divisions might include population density, economic opportunities, and access to natural resources. Often, the division of land serves to concentrate wealth, power, and influence among a few influential families, potentially leading to widespread socioeconomic disparities in the state. Moreover, the division could raise questions about equitable distribution of wealth and land, as well as land use policies aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural practices and equitable land reforms. It is essential to examine these factors in the context of the state's overall development strategy, including relevant legislation and land reform initiatives. From the provided information, it is not possible to determine the number of families that shared the two-fifths of the state's territory but by giving historical context and considering the factors mentioned above, a meaningful discussion regarding land distribution and its implications can be generated.

We have a math problem to solve for \\"j\\". Here's the problem: -2043*j = -110*j + 210697 Now, we want to get all the \\"j\\" parts together. So let's add 2043*j to both sides of the equation to cancel it out: (-2043*j) + 2043*j = (-110*j + 210697) + 2043*j This simplifies to: 0 = 1933*j + 210697 Now, we want to get \\"j\\" all by itself. Let's subtract 210697 from both sides to get rid of that number: 1933*j = -210697 Next, we will divide both sides by 1933 in order to find out what \\"j\\" is: j = -210697 ÷ 1933 Do the math, and you'll find: j = -109 So the solution to the problem is: j = -109.

With its capital at Saarbrücken, it has an area of 2,570 km² and its population (as of 30 April 2012) is approximately 1,012,000. In terms of both area and population size  apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg  it is Germany's smallest federal state. The wealth of its coal deposits and their large-scale industrial exploitation, coupled with its location on the border between France and Germany, have given the Saarland a unique history in modern times.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Saar Protectorate ( German : Saarprotektorat ; French : Protectorat de Sarre ) was a short - lived protectorate ( 1947 -- 56 ) partitioned from Germany after its defeat in World War II ; it was administered by the French Fourth Republic . On rejoining West Germany in 1957 , becoming the smallest \`\` area state '' ( Flächenland ) , the Saarland , not counting the \`\` city states '' ( Stadtstaaten ) of Berlin , Hamburg and Bremen . It is named after the Saar River . The region around the Saar River and its tributary valleys is a geographically folded , mineral - rich , ethnically German , economically important , heavily industrialized area . It has well - developed transportation infrastructure that was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution in Germany and around 1900 formed the third - largest area of coal , iron , and steel industry in Germany ( after the Ruhr Area and the Upper Silesian Coal Basin ) . From 1920 to 1935 , as a result of World War I , the region was under the control of the League of Nations as the Territory of the Saar Basin . Near the end of World War II it was heavily bombed by the Allies as part of their strategic bombing campaigns . Geographically , the post -- World War II protectorate corresponded to the current German state of Saarland ( established after its incorporation into West Germany on 1 January 1957 ) . A policy of industrial disarmament and dispersal of industrial workers was officially pursued by the Allies after the war until 1951 and the region was made a protectorate under French control in 1947 . Cold War pressures for a stronger Germany allowed renewed industrialization , and the French returned control of the region to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II.

The American, British, and French sectors became West Berlin, strongly associated with West Germany, while East Berlin was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989, East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall.  - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989.  - The Warsaw Pact, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance and sometimes, informally, WarPac. was a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven other Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - The German reunification was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR/East Germany) joined the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG/West Germany) to form the reunited nation of Germany, and when Berlin reunited into a single city, as provided by its then Grundgesetz constitution Article 23. The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity, celebrated on 3 October (German Unity Day). Following German reunification, Berlin was once again designated as the capital of united Germany.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.  - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.  - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries  both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.  - The French Fourth Republic was the republican government of France between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican constitution. It was in many ways a revival of the Third Republic, which was in place before World War II, and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.  - The Elbe (; Low German: \\"Elv\\") is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Krkonoše Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is .  - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state Berlin forming a metropolitan area.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Metropolregion Hamburg (German for Hamburg Metropolitan Region) is the compilation of eight districts in the German federal state of Lower Saxony, six districts in Schleswig-Holstein, two districts in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the city-state of Hamburg in northern Germany. It covers an area of ca , and is home to more than 5.1 million inhabitants.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Saarbrücken ([], Rhine Franconian: \\"Saarbrigge\\" []) is the capital and largest city of the state of Saarland, Germany. Saarbrücken is Saarland's administrative, commercial and cultural centre. The city is situated next to the French border at the heart of the metropolitan area of Saarland.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.  - The Havel is a river in north-eastern Germany, flowing through the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt. It is a right tributary of the Elbe river and long. However, the direct distance from its source to its mouth is only .  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - The Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the \\"death strip\\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \\"fakir beds\\" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the Wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the \\"will of the people\\" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.  - The inner German border (or \\"deutsch-deutsche Grenze\\"; initially also \\"Zonengrenze\\") was the border between the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) from 1949 to 1990. Not including the similar but physically separate Berlin Wall, the border was long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.     What is the relationship between 'saar protectorate' and 'saarbrücken'? Answer:","output":"The Saar Protectorate was a short-lived protectorate partitioned from Germany after its defeat in World War II, and it was administered by the French Fourth Republic. The Saarland, which emerged from the Saar Protectorate, is one of the sixteen federal states of Germany, with its capital at Saarbrücken. Saarbrücken is the largest city and the administrative, commercial, and cultural center of Saarland. So, the relationship between the Saar Protectorate and Saarbrücken is that Saarbrücken is the capital city of the Saarland, which was formerly the Saar Protectorate under French administration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And a made for TV movie too, this movie was good. the acting in it and the plot was just so great. this one of the only movies I've seen that I felt warped my mind because after seeing it I was afraid of Reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen. There were just a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's very easily over looked. Antonio Sabbato Jr did an excellent role in this movie along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because I never thought a low budget TV movie could be so powerful. After viewing this I read the novel this movie was based on (four times) and it too kicked was great. If you ever see this movie come on TV, I'd watch it.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input i,A where i is an integer and A is an array. You need to find every ith element of A starting with the 1st element. Q: 1, ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] A:","output":"To find every ith element of A starting with the 1st element, follow these steps: 1. Identify the input i and the array A:    i = 1    A = ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] 2. Initialize an empty list called 'output' to collect the ith elements of the array A. 3. Loop through the array using an index, which we'll call 'index':    - Start with index = 0 (since we're starting with the 1st element of the array)    - Increase the index by i after each iteration (in this case, i = 1)    - Continue looping until index >= len(A), which means we've reached the end of the array. 4. In each iteration, get the element in the array A at the current index and append it to the output list.    - Use A[index] to access the element at the current index.    - Use the append() method to add the element to the output list. 5. After the loop is finished, return the output list containing all the ith elements starting with the 1st element. Justification for each step: - Steps 1-2: Setting up the necessary variables and lists for solving the problem. - Step 3: Looping through the array A with an incremental step of i (1 in this case) to collect all the necessary elements. - Step 4: Appending each ith element to the output list to create a collection of ith elements. - Step 5: Returning the output list as the final result. Here is the implementation: \`\`\`python i = 1 A = ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] output = [] for index in range(0, len(A), i):     element = A[index]     output.append(element) # Output: ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] \`\`\` In this particular case, i is 1, which means we will get all elements of the array in the output list. The final output is: ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B']"},{"instruction":"Question: The group decides to return to where?

The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What else contributes to a higher demand from the electrical system?","output":"There are several factors that can contribute to a higher demand from the electrical system in a building, besides the high current draw of the hydraulic elevator pump when starting up: 1. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems: Large HVAC systems require significant electrical power to operate, especially during peak heating or cooling times when multiple units might need to run simultaneously. 2. Lighting Systems: Both indoor and outdoor lighting can contribute to increased electrical demand. This includes not only general lighting but also any specialized illumination, such as emergency lighting, signage, and decorative lighting. 3. Appliances and office equipment: Various electrical devices like computers, printers, refrigerators, cooking appliances, and other office equipment can place a higher demand on the electrical system when used frequently or simultaneously. 4. Power surges: Sudden increases in the electrical demand, such as when multiple large appliances start up at once, can cause temporary spikes in the electrical system's load. 5. Building Occupancy: As the number of people using a building increases, so does the demand for electricity. This includes increased usage of lights, appliances, and other electrical systems. 6. Additional electrical systems: Security systems, audio/video systems, telecommunication systems, and other specialized systems installed in a building may also contribute to the overall electrical demand. 7. Aging electrical infrastructure: Older electrical systems may not be as efficient or well-maintained as newer ones, which could lead to increased electrical demand and possible issues with power quality. It is crucial to properly assess and manage the electrical demand in a building to ensure the overall efficiency, safety, and reliability of the electrical system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I have a new situation: Tommy sets two pots of water, Pot A and Pot B, on the stove and sets each burner to a different temperature. Tommy is unable to see what the temperatures of the burners are though. He sits around patiently and waits until he notices that Pot B's water is beginning to vaporize, while Pot A's water is not vaporizing.  But I can use this background: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.  What is an answer for this question: The water in which pot is hotter? Answer:","output":"The water in Pot B is hotter. Since Pot B's water has begun to vaporize, it has likely reached or exceeded 100°C, while Pot A's water has not yet reached the boiling point."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We want to find the value of 'f' in the equation: -49*f - 290 = 70*f - 5764 Now, let's follow these steps together: 1. First, we want to get 'f' terms on one side of the equation and numbers on the other side. So, let's add 49*f to both sides to move the -49*f: -49*f + 49*f - 290 = 70*f + 49*f - 5764 -290 = 119*f - 5764 2. Now, let's add 5764 to both sides to move the -5764: -290 + 5764 = 119*f 5474 = 119*f 3. Finally, let's get the value of 'f' by dividing both sides by 119: 5474 ÷ 119 = 119*f ÷ 119 46 = f And there you have it! The value of 'f' is 46 in this math problem.

Fact 2: Stems of plants include trunks and branches.  Given the two facts above, what part of a tree would be woody and covered in bark? The answer is:","output":"Both the trunk and the branches of the tree would be woody and covered in bark. To elaborate: The woody stem of the tree includes both its trunk and its branches. These structures fulfill a variety of essential functions for the growth, development, and survival of trees.  First, let's discuss the trunk. The trunk is the main body of the tree, connecting its roots to its branches. Internally, it consists of multiple layers that perform different tasks, such as transporting water and nutrients, supporting the tree, and promoting growth. One of these layers is the bark, which is the protective outer covering of the tree's trunk. Certain factors including the species of tree, its geographical location, and age can influence the texture and appearance of the bark. Irrespective of these varying factors, bark generally serves as an armor against external threats such as pests, diseases, and harsh weather, effectively safeguarding the inner, more vulnerable layers of the trunk. Moving on to the branches, these are an extension of the tree's trunk and are mainly involved in spreading out to seek sunlight for performing photosynthesis. Similar to the trunk, branches also consist of woody tissue that provides them strength and helps them reach towards the light effectively. This woody substance is covered by bark, offering them the same level of protection as offered to the trunk. In other words, bark acts as a protective barrier for branches too, protecting them from external threats. Given the above, considering both the trunk and the branches of a tree are classified as its stem, and as such, are declared to be covered by bark and made of woody tissue, it's clear that both these parts of a tree - its trunk and branches - would indeed be woody and covered in bark."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences mention the term \\"whistleblower\\": Although the first sentence does not specify the agency Snowden is associated with, the term \\"whistleblower\\" conveys similar meanings in both sentences, emphasizing the role Snowden played in leaking classified information. 3. Both sentences mention Moscow as the destination: This is another significant similarity, as it identifies the same location where Edward Snowden was heading. 4. The context of both sentences is similar: Both sentences refer to the action of Edward Snowden traveling or leaving one location for another; in one sentence, he \\"flies\\" while in the other, he \\"leaves\\" on a flight. The context is the same, despite the difference in verb usage. 5. Differences in details: The first sentence does not specify which agency Snowden is a whistleblower for or his departure location; in contrast, the second sentence identifies Snowden's affiliation (NSA) and his departure location (Hong Kong). This distinction slightly reduces the overall similarity between the sentences.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Movie plot: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of Jason murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason kills Michael in real life, along with Jane, and later kills another couple camping in the woods. While Tina goes off to find her mother and Nick goes with her, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens. Russell is killed with a hatchet to the face, and Sandra is pulled underwater while she is skinny-dipping. Jason stalks Maddie and kills her in the barn with a scythe, and then crushes Ben's skull with his bare hands before shoving a party horn... The answer is:","output":"Tina runs from the cabin due to the emotional turmoil and distress caused by Dr. Crews' experiments (verbal assaults) that were designed to agitate her mental state and force her telekinetic powers to become more pronounced. The sessions with Dr. Crews were causing Tina immense emotional pain, and in a moment of desperation to escape this torment, she fled the cabin and went to the dock. This escape to the dock leads her to think about her father's death and triggers a series of events that result in her accidental resurrection of Jason Voorhees instead of her father. As Jason emerges from the lake and starts his killing spree, Tina becomes more distraught about the consequences of her actions, further complicating her reasons for fleeing the cabin initially. In summary, Tina runs from the cabin due to the emotional stress caused by Dr. Crews' experiments and an attempt to escape her past and current pain. This triggers a series of unintended consequences that lead to the resurrection of Jason Voorhees and the subsequent violence and deaths in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Whenever you wish to find the derivative of the square root of a variable or a function, you can apply a simple pattern. The derivative will always be the derivative of the radicand, divided by double the original square root. Symbolically, this can be shown as: If f(x)=u{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {u}}}, then f′(x)=u′2u{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {u^{prime }}{2{sqrt {u}}}}} The radicand is the term or function underneath the square root sign. To apply this shortcut, find the derivative of the radicand alone. Consider the following examples:  In the function 5x+2{displaystyle {sqrt {5x+2}}}, the radicand is (5x+2){displaystyle (5x+2)}. Its derivative is 5{displaystyle 5}. In the function 3x4{displaystyle {sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, the radicand is 3x4{displaystyle 3x^{4}}. Its derivative is 12x3{displaystyle 12x^{3}}. In the function sin(x){displaystyle {sqrt {sin(x)}}}, the radicand is sin⁡(x){displaystyle sin(x)}. Its derivative is cos⁡(x){displaystyle cos(x)}. The derivative of a radical function will involve a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the derivative of the radicand. Thus, for the sample functions above, the first part of the derivative will be as follows:  If f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=5denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {5}{text{denom}}}}  If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x3denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {12x^{3}}{text{denom}}}}  If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {cos(x)}{text{denom}}}} Using this shortcut, the denominator will be two times the original square root function. Thus, for the three sample functions above, the denominators of the derivatives will be:  For f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=num25x+2{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {5x+2}}}}}  If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=num23x4{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}}  If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=num2sin⁡(x){displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {sin(x)}}}}} Put the two halves of the fraction together, and the result will be the derivative of the original function.  For f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=525x+2{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {5}{2{sqrt {5x+2}}}}}  If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x323x4{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {12x^{3}}{2{sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}}  If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)2sin⁡(x){displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {cos(x)}{2{sqrt {sin(x)}}}}} What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text or information.

Context: Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread. A:","output":"Zinc is added to soil primarily through the weathering of rocks.

Question: Given the below context:  Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral.  Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire.  Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.

It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: \\"Niobe\\", daughter of \\"Tantalus\\" since it is so similar to tantalum.  - Stibnite, sometimes called antimonite, is a sulfide mineral with the formula SbS. This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony. The name is from the Greek  \\"stibi\\" through the Latin \\"stibium\\" as the old name for the mineral and the element antimony.  - Pyrochlore (Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F) is a mineral group of the niobium end member (pyrochlore supergroup).  - A metalloid is any chemical element which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or that has a mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry.  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.  - Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from ) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540.  - Vannoccio Biringuccio, sometimes spelt Vannocio Biringuccio (c. 1480  c. 1539), was an Italian metallurgist. He is best known for his manual on metalworking, \\"De la pirotechnia\\", published posthumously in 1540. Biringuccio is considered by some as the father of the foundry industry as \\"De la pirotechnia\\" is the first printed account of proper foundry practice. It also gives details of mining practice, the extraction and refining of numerous metals, alloys such as brass, and compounds used in foundries and explosives.  It preceded the printing of \\"De re metallica\\" by Georgius Agricola by 14 years.  - In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.  - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - Stibiconite is an antimony oxide mineral with formula : Sb3O6 ( OH ) . Its name originates from Greek \`\` stibi '' ( antimony ) and \`\` konis '' ( powder ) , alluding to its composition and habit . It is a member of the pyrochlore super group .    What is the relationship between 'stibiconite' and 'pyrochlore supergroup'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Stibiconite (Sb3O6(OH)) is a mineral that belongs to the pyrochlore supergroup. The pyrochlore supergroup is a large and diverse group of minerals, characterized by their complex crystal structures, which are primarily composed of A-site and B-site cations, along with oxygen or hydroxide anions. In the case of stibiconite, antimony (Sb) is the primary B-site cation present in the complex structure.  The relationship between stibiconite and the pyrochlore supergroup lies in their crystal structure and chemical composition. Both stibiconite and the pyrochlore group of minerals share the general formula A2B2O6(O, OH, F), with variations in A and B cations giving rise to a wide range of mineral compositions. The incorporation of antimony (Sb) into the crystal structure is a notable characteristic of stibiconite, which sets it apart from other minerals in the pyrochlore supergroup. Furthermore, the pyrochlore supergroup is known for its diverse range of physical and chemical properties, arising from the different arrangement of ions within the crystal structure. In stibiconite, this results in a mineral characterized by its antimony oxide composition, distinctive from other minerals in the group. In summary, stibiconite is a member of the pyrochlore supergroup, which shares the same complex crystal structure and general chemical composition with other minerals in the supergroup. The relationship between stibiconite and the pyrochlore supergroup highlights the diversity within the group, with stibiconite exhibiting its unique properties due to the presence of antimony in its structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Atlanta Falcons have \\"relinquished their contractual rights\\" to Michael Vick, one of the highest-paid players in professional sports before his conviction on dogfighting charges, the Falcons manager said Friday. Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence. In a statement posted on the football team's Web site, General Manager Thomas Dimitroff said, \\"Michael remains suspended by the NFL [National Football League]. However, in the event NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell decides to reinstate Michael, we feel his best opportunity to re-engage his football career would be at another club. The quarterback was drafted by the","output":"Atlanta Falcons in 2001 as the first overall pick and quickly emerged as one of the most talented and dynamic players in the league. With his electrifying style of play, Vick became a cultural icon and earned millions in endorsements. However, his dogfighting scandal tarnished his reputation and resulted in a 23-month federal prison sentence, as well as an indefinite suspension from the NFL. After serving his time and demonstrating remorse for his actions, Vick was eventually reinstated by Commissioner Goodell in 2009. The Philadelphia Eagles signed Vick to a one-year contract with an option for a second year, knowing the risk of public backlash but also recognizing his potential to positively contribute both on and off the field. Michael Vick demonstrated significant progress during his time with the Eagles, becoming an advocate for animal rights and working to rehabilitate his image. Vick continued to strive for redemption, as he played with the New York Jets, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and served as a coaching intern with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2017. In each of these teams, Vick tried to impart his experiences and lessons learned from his past mistakes to help mentor and guide younger players. His competitive spirit and desire to prove himself were evident, and he continued to display impressive skills, though they were not as dominant as they were during his prime with the Falcons. Throughout his career, Vick faced many challenges including injuries, legal issues, and public scrutiny. He faced his mistakes head-on and worked hard to atone for them and become a better person. Upon retiring from the NFL in 2017, Vick continued to stay involved in football, working with networks like Fox as an analyst and engaging in community outreach programs. In conclusion, Michael Vick's journey after his conviction on dogfighting charges showcases the possibility of redemption and second chances in both a professional capacity and personal growth. His career after being released by the Atlanta Falcons demonstrated that opportunities can still present themselves for individuals willing to accept responsibility for their past actions and work diligently to correct their mistakes. Although he may never be able to erase the stigma attached to his name, Vick earned the respect of many by continuing to fight for a better future for himself and those he impacted with his actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before the 1950s, the department store held an eminent place in both Canada and Australia, during both the Great Depression and World War II. Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls. In 2003, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by big-box store sales for the first time (though some stores may be classified as \\"big box\\" by physical layout and \\"department store\\" by merchandise).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How will I improve my spoken English? HOw do I speak Fluent English? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"While the two questions seem to be similar, they have different nuances in their intent. The first question, \\"How will I improve my spoken English?\\" seems to seek advice on ways to enhance one's English speaking skills. In contrast, the second question, \\"How do I speak Fluent English?\\" appears to focus more on achieving fluency, or the ability to speak the language smoothly and effortlessly. Therefore, while the questions are related, they are not exactly the same. Now, let us address each question with a detailed and long answer. 1. How to improve your spoken English: Improving your spoken English involves practicing regularly, increasing your vocabulary, and working on pronunciation and grammar skills. Here are some recommended strategies: a. Practicing speaking: Engage in conversations with native speakers or join English-speaking groups where you can practice speaking the language. Listening is equally important for improving your speaking – watch English movies, listen to podcasts, and practice imitating the accents and speaking styles. b. Expanding vocabulary: Learn new words every day and practice using them in sentences. You can maintain a journal to keep track of your progress. Reading articles, books, or watching English movies and shows can also help you discover new words and phrases. c. Improving pronunciation: Pronunciation plays a vital role in spoken English. There are online resources and videos that demonstrate the correct pronunciation of words. You can use these resources to perfect your pronunciation, or even use a voice recording app to monitor your progress. d. Working on grammar: To improve spoken English, it is essential to have a solid understanding of grammar. Take some time to study different grammatical concepts and practice applying them when speaking.  e. Seeking feedback: Have your conversations assessed by a native speaker or a language expert to identify areas of improvement. This way, you can work specifically on those areas and continually enhance your language skills. 2. How to speak fluent English: Fluency in spoken English requires mastering elements such as vocabulary, grammar, and flow. To achieve fluency, consider the following tips: a. Think in English: To speak fluently, you need to train your brain to process information in English. Practice thinking in English before expressing your thoughts, which will eventually help you form your ideas and sentences more accurately and efficiently. b. Develop confidence: Fear of making mistakes may hinder your fluency. Be confident and don't be afraid to make errors, as it's a part of the learning process. The more you speak without fear, the smoother your speech will become. c. Focus on the flow of speech: Conversations sound more fluent when you maintain a steady flow of speech. Practice connecting words, breaking down complex sentences into smaller phrases, and using appropriate transitions, such as \\"however,\\" \\"meanwhile,\\" or \\"in addition.\\" d. Use filler phrases: These are phrases that provide short breaks in your speech and give you time to think. Examples include \\"Well,\\" \\"Actually,\\" \\"You know,\\" or \\"In my opinion.\\" Using filler phrases can help you speak English more naturally and fluently. e. Record yourself: Record your speech and listen to it afterward. This will help you identify areas where you can improve your fluency, such as intonation, pace, or clarity. Both the improvement of spoken English and the achievement of fluency are ongoing processes that require dedication, regular practice, and consistent efforts. By following these strategies and remaining determined, you will observe significant progress in your English speaking skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"A physical change is a process in which the substance undergoes a transformation without altering its chemical composition, while a chemical change involves the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, leading to the formation of a new substance with a different chemical composition. An example of a physical change but not a chemical change is the melting of ice into water. In this process, the ice (solid-state) absorbs heat from its surroundings and undergoes a phase transition from a solid state to a liquid state, turning into water. The molecules of water in the solid state are arranged in a rigid lattice structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. As energy is absorbed, these hydrogen bonds are weakened, and the molecules gain sufficient energy to break free from the lattice structure and move more freely, transitioning from the solid state to the liquid state. It is important to note that the chemical composition of the substance does not change during this process. The chemical formula for both the ice and the water remains H2O, and no new molecules or bonds are formed or broken during the melting process. This is why the melting of ice is an example of a physical change but not a chemical change. The substance undergoing the transformation maintains its chemical identity throughout the process, and the change is only evident in its physical properties, such as its state of matter, appearance, and temperature. Other examples of physical changes include the boiling of water into steam, the cracking of a glass, or the dissolution of salt or sugar in water. In each of these cases, the substance may appear different or exhibit different properties, but its chemical composition remains unchanged during the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The rocket booster successfully landed on the ground nine minutes after taking off. The touchdown is part of the company's strategy of returning rockets to earth so they can be reused rather than jettisoning them in the ocean after a single launch. Moments after the rocket landed, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship successfully reached orbit, prompting cheers inside the SpaceX Mission Control room. The Dragon is now making its way to the International Space Station, and is expected to arrive on Wednesday. On 14 January SpaceX resumed flights by launching a Falcon 9 vehicle from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast. It was the first mission by the company since one of its vehicles exploded on the launch pad in September.

Larwood began choking on a piece of steak.            \\"Somebody tried to give her the Heimlich maneuver, and they weren't big enough,\\" said Fernandez.            Restaurant supervisor J.R. Gonzalez also tried to help, but to no avail.            Fortunately for Larwood, there were numerous doctors in the house because of the Valley Fever Symposium. Among the diners was Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of infectious diseases at Kern Medical Center.            Johnson sprang into action to perform an emergency tracheotomy with makeshift tools he had at his disposal.            \\"The doctor said, 'Let's put her on the ground,'\\" Fernandez described, \\"and he made an incision with a knife.\\" Fernandez motioned how the doctor inserted the knife to Larwood's throat area.            Johnson then inserted the hollow cylinder of a pen to act as a breathing tube, according to Fernandez.            \\"It took a little bit, but finally their gasp comes,\\" he said.            Also helping out during the procedure were Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Paul Krogstad, who were participants at the Valley Fever Symposium, according to The Bakersfield Californian.            Larwood is recovering at a local hospital. ||||| The dramatic incident took place at a restaurant where top officials had gathered after leaving the landmark symposium on valley fever held in Bakersfield on Monday and Tuesday. Some of the nation’s most accomplished physicians were in the room.      A local doctor is being hailed as a hero after he used a folding pocket knife and pen to perform an emergency tracheotomy on a former Kern County supervisor at a downtown Bakersfield restaurant Monday night.      Pauline Larwood, who was Kern County’s first female supervisor and currently serves as a community college trustee, was eating dinner at The Mark restaurant with some of the doctors, experts, politicians and others in town for the symposium when she began choking.      After the Heimlich maneuver failed to open Larwood’s airway, witnesses said, Dr. Royce Johnson, professor of medicine at UCLA and Kern Medical Center’s chief of infectious diseases, used a friend’s knife to make an incision in Larwood’s throat to allow the insertion of the hollow cylinder of a pen as a breathing tube.      The procedure succeeded and Larwood was rushed to Mercy Hospital Downtown.      By Tuesday, her son said, she was doing fine.      Johnson had appeared onstage Monday at the valley fever conference with Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.      The CDC chief monitored Larwood’s pulse during the incident. Collins was also present at the dinner.      Following a forum and survivors reception, about 55 people dined together in the downtown restaurant’s banquet room, including farming and business moguls Lynda and Stewart Resnick, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, said The Mark’s General Manager Ro Fernandez. At least two members of McCarthy’s security detail were also present.      The entrees had just been served — steak, chicken or salmon — but Fernandez said he wasn’t sure which dish Larwood had chosen.      Assemblywoman Shannon Grove, R-Bakersfield, said she was seated at a table with the Larwoods when the incident occurred. She said her husband, Rick Grove, and state Sen. Jean Fuller, R-Bakersfield, were seated on the other side of the table.      Grove said her husband suddenly jumped up, ran to Pauline Larwood and tried to perform the Heimlich maneuver. He called for a doctor and Johnson attempted the technique as well.      “She had already started turning a real like blue, her fingers and her lips,” Grove said.      As Grove called 911, she watched in amazement as Larwood was laid back in a chair and Johnson began performing the emergency procedure.      “He didn’t scream; he just said, ‘I need a knife,’” Grove said.      Grove called Johnson a hero.      “It was really unreal how calm (the situation) was,” she said.      The folding knife Johnson used came from Dr. Thomas Farrell Jr., a retired physician and friend of Johnson’s, who said he always carries the knife.      Farrell said Larwood’s skin turned blue and she lost consciousness. Her teeth were clenched so tightly he could not work to clear the blockage.      As several physicians gathered around Larwood, Dr. Paul Krogstad, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said someone called for a pen, and when one was handed to him, he broke it in half and placed it in the incision Johnson had made.      “I was sort of looking at her breathing, Royce is blowing into this tracheotomy that he performed and the CDC director (Frieden) is checking her pulse,” Krogstad said. “She came around.”      \\"She was fortunate that somebody as bold as Dr. Johnson jumped in,” he added. “By the time I got there, he already had a plan going and Dr. Frieden and I just assisted.\\"      Nevertheless, the doctors worked as a team.      Frieden called out that Larwood did not need chest compressions and that she had a good pulse, Krogstad recalled.      “I've never seen that done in public before but it made good sense,” Krogstad said of the tracheotomy.      It was ”a pretty drastic measure,” he added, but “everyone knew what they were doing.”      Before the ambulance even arrived, Larwood was sitting up, talking and fully conscious, Krogstad said.      “She pinked up, her skin looked good pretty quickly,” said David Larwood, Tom and Pauline Larwood's son.      Throughout the incident, Tom Larwood remained absolutely calm.      Johnson declined to comment.      David Larwood said his mother was taken to Mercy Hospital, where she stayed overnight. He said his father was with her Tuesday and she would probably be able to go home later that day.      Larwood, 71, served on the Kern County Board of Supervisors from 1983 to 1994. She currently serves on the Kern Community College District’s board of trustees, another elected position.      Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Fernandez complimented McCarthy’s security detail for keeping people calm and allowing rescuers to do what they needed to do.      The crisis and the arrival of an ambulance brought an early end to the evening, Fernandez said. But everyone was relieved that Larwood appeared to be OK.      “It must have been quite an evening for all of them,” he said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In a restaurant, there was a woman named Pauline Larwood who started choking on a piece of steak.

They are publicly humiliated, losing the competition. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (John Benjamin Hickey), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in Los Angeles, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave college, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career.

Sean Spicer, arguably the world’s most famous White House press secretary, is developing a talk show with the tentative title of “Sean Spicer’s Common Ground,” in which the former spokesman for President Trump interviews notable people in an informal setting.      A pitch sheet for the show’s pilot, obtained by The New York Times, describes Mr. Spicer hosting “some of the most interesting and thoughtful public figures for a drink and some lite conversation at a local pub or cafe.”      “The relaxed atmosphere is an ideal setting for Sean to get to know his guests as they discuss everything from the media to marriage,” the pitch continues. “They might even tangle over the merits of making your bed or the value of a great point guard.”      No network is attached to the project, but the pilot episode, to be filmed in July, is backed by heavy hitters in the realm of unscripted television. Debmar-Mercury, the syndicator of daytime series including “The Wendy Williams Show” and “Family Feud,” is co-producing with Pilgrim Media Group, which has developed basic-cable staples like “American Chopper.” ||||| Sean Spicer may be entering the TV business.      President Donald Trump's former spokesman is teaming with Lionsgate-owned Debmar-Mercury (The Wendy Williams Show) and Pilgrim Media Group (American Chopper) to develop a talk show called Sean Spicer's Common Ground, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.      The potential series — a network is not yet attached — would see Spicer interviewing notable people in an informal setting, according to The New York Times, which first reported the news. The Times, which acquired a pitch sheet for a potential pilot for the series, reported that the show would feature Spicer hosting public figures for a drink and light conversation at a local pub or cafe. The pilot is poised to be filmed in July and would feature one guest per week.      Attorney Michael Avenatti, who has repped Stormy Daniels, has been approached as a guest for Spicer's pilot. (He declined.)      \\"In this current environment, I think it’s important to have a platform where we can have civil, respectful and informative discussions on the issues of the day,” Spicer told the Times.      The talk show is one of multiple projects Spicer is pursuing since leaving the White House last July. Repped by WME, Spicer has also launched a podcast, Everything's Going to Be All Right, with conservative writer Katie Pavlich, and joined America First Action, a super PAC created to support Trump and his allies. He also penned a book covering his six months in the White House that is due out July 24. A book tour, complete with documentary film crew, is expected. ||||| Summary:","output":"Sean Spicer, former White House press secretary, is developing a talk show called \\"Sean Spicer's Common Ground.\\" The show, which does not yet have a network attached, would involve Spicer interviewing notable public figures in an informal setting.

The car would not fit inside of the garage despite numerous attempts because the","output":"dimensions of the car exceeded the space available in the garage. In order to resolve this issue, several steps had to be taken. Step 1: Analyze the Problem First, it was essential to accurately measure the dimensions of both the car and the garage. It was discovered that the car's length and width exceeded the garage's dimensions, leaving no room for proper maneuvering. Since it was apparent that the car could not be physically altered to fit, the solution had to focus on modifying the garage or finding an alternative storage solution. Step 2: Research Potential Solutions Two main potential solutions were identified in this step: either increasing the size of the garage or elevating the car horizontally and using the available vertical space. Option A: Increasing the size of the garage This approach involved finding a contractor to expand the internal space of the garage, which would enable the car to be parked inside easily. It would require obtaining the necessary permits or approvals, as well as choosing the right construction materials. Option B: Elevating the car horizontally Another possibility was to employ a car lift system that could elevate the car above the ground, allowing for additional storage space beneath it. This solution would utilize the available vertical space within the garage, while still permitting the car to be stored inside, and could be a more budget-friendly option compared to expanding the garage. Step 3: Evaluate and Choose a Solution After considering the pros and cons of both options, it was decided that the most feasible and cost-effective solution was Option B - installing a car lift system. This choice was based on the fact that it did not require any alterations to the garage structure, and no permits or approvals were needed. Additionally, this solution would not only accommodate the current car but could also be helpful if the owner decided to acquire larger vehicles in the future. Step 4: Implement the Chosen Solution After consulting with a local supplier, a suitable car lift system was selected and installed in the garage. The system was properly tested to ensure it could adequately support the weight of the car and function correctly. Following the installation, the owner was able to store the car in the garage by elevating it horizontally, fully utilizing the vertical space available. By following these steps and taking a methodical approach to the problem, a feasible and efficient solution was identified and implemented, resulting in a garage that could finally accommodate the oversized car."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: suppose humans build more factories and plants happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"more effect. Here's my justification:  The situation described above suggests a cause-effect relationship of industrial activities causing acid rain, which subsequently harms natural and man-made objects. Step 1: The increased establishment of factories and plants (if supposed perturbation refers to an increase in industrial activities) would likely lead to a corresponding increase in the production of chemical compounds (assuming these factories are of the kind that produce these compounds). Step 2: These additional chemical compounds would then rise into the air (following the process described). Step 3: The additional airborne chemical compounds would mix with elements in clouds, creating more instances of the chemical reactions that result in acid rain. Step 4: More of this 'affected rain' (i.e. acid rain) would fall to the earth.  Step 5: Given the described harmful effects of this acid rain, we can infer an increase in the amount of rain would consequently lead to more harm to natural and man-made objects. Hence, there would be more damage by acid rain. The influence on the second effect mentioned - 'The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content'- would be greater (more effect) because of the increased industrial activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sports This passage is clearly related to the sports category, as it discusses a specific match in a soccer competition. The UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Cup is a prestigious club soccer competition held in Europe. Group A represents one of the initial stages of the tournament, where clubs are competing not only for points but also for a chance to move on to the final knockout stages. The match result, Feyenoord's 2-1 victory over Schalke, is notable as it secured their place in those advanced stages of the competition. To provide more context and detail, the UEFA Cup (now known as the UEFA Europa League) is an annual soccer competition contested by European club soccer teams. It is the second most prestigious tournament in Europe after the UEFA Champions League. The format of the competition includes a group stage composed of multiple groups with multiple teams in each group. Each team in the group plays each other in a round-robin format, in which they gather points based on wins, losses, and draws. Feyenoord and Schalke are both well-known soccer clubs in Europe with a rich history. Feyenoord is a Dutch club founded in 1908 and based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. They have a long tradition of success, both domestically in the Eredivisie, which is the Netherlands' top soccer division, and internationally in the European competitions. Schalke, on the other hand, is a German club founded in 1904 and hailing from Gelsenkirchen. The club has also enjoyed domestic success in the Bundesliga, Germany's top soccer division, as well as international recognition. In the match mentioned in the initial passage, Feyenoord managed to secure a victory against Schalke at their home ground. This win was crucial for Feyenoord, as it assured their progression to the final knockout stages of the UEFA Cup, where the competition switches to a home-and-away elimination format. The knockout stages often feature high-stakes and intense matches between top European clubs as they vie for the opportunity to advance to the final of the tournament. This snippet of information is relevant and of interest for soccer enthusiasts and sports fans, as it provides a glimpse of the ongoing club soccer competition and the journey of respective teams in their quest for European glory. Furthermore, it aligns well with the sports category since it focuses on club soccer and the progress of these two well-known European clubs in the UEFA Cup."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: If it is still true that a strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England then Alastair Cook can look forward to a golden era, with the White Rose at the forefront of both the international game and the chase for domestic honours. Yorkshire’s march towards the county championship title, which can be confirmed if they avoid defeat against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge this week, could be the start of something big at Headingley and beyond. Not only are Yorkshire on the verge of clinching the greatest prize in the domestic game but they are doing it with a squad crammed with potential England players and an academy bulging with many more top prospects. Champions elect: Jason Gillespie's Yorkshire could clinch the title this week. At the forefront of Yorkshire’s rise towards their first title in 13 years is an ex-Australian Test bowler who has made it his mission to provide the old enemy with as many aspiring internationals as possible. What’s more, Jason Gillespie is making sure that a county once known for their divisive internal politics have a smile on their face as they march forward with young players very much to the fore. ‘Since I’ve been at the club all I’ve done is tell the lads to back themselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play,’ said Gillespie ahead of Tuesday’s showdown with their biggest rivals for the county title. ‘Be positive, go out with a smile and enjoy the game. ‘I coach because I love cricket and I love helping lads achieve their dreams. And spectators come and watch because they love the game too. For me it’s all about enjoyment. If you’re not enjoying it why are you doing it?’ Homegrown: Sheffield-born Joe Root has gone on to be a key player for England. All-rounder: Gary Ballance is another player from the county to break into the international set-up. It is an ethos that has seen Yorkshire achieve that elusive balance of competing for trophies while recognising their duty to give opportunities to young English players. Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett, rejuvenated after his move from Durham, have all played for England this season while openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees and leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid head the queue of those who could join them. Jonathan Bairstow, meanwhile, has recovered from a nightmare winter in Australia to provide hope that he too could once again represent his country. And this summer’s England Under 19 team included five Yorkshiremen. ‘We’re always keen to give our young lads a crack as often as possible,’ said Gillespie, who is quick to credit the role of director of cricket Martyn Moxon and his support staff for Yorkshire’s rise. ‘I’m a big believer in if they’re good enough they’re old enough. I like to drip feed the young lads into first-team cricket. Prospect: Opener Adam Lyth has become a key player for Yorkshire. ‘As a county we do have a duty to produce as many players for England as we can. At the same time this county is ambitious and wants to win trophies, absolutely. So it’s finding that balance. All counties want to win but we all have to look at the bigger picture.’ The bigger picture for Gillespie is trying to ensure that the likes of Lyth, Rashid and Lees, considered by England to be the best prospect of the lot, join Root and Ballance in competing for the Ashes next summer. Surely that would provide divided loyalties? ‘No question I’d be proud if these guys line up against the Aussies next year,’ said a man who took 259 Test wickets for Australia and hit a Test double hundred. ‘First and foremost I’m the coach of Yorkshire and part of my job is to help my players represent England. I’ll be absolutely chuffed if they are there and I’ll be supporting them. ‘Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and that will never change. Last time in the Ashes there were a few Yorkies playing and I was really hoping they’d do well as well as wanting my country to do well. It can be a tough one but my priority is seeing Yorkshire players succeed.’ Front foot: Youngster Alex Lees has piled on the runs in 2014. Comeback: Spin king Adil Rashid could return to the England set-up for the first time in five years. Yorkshire’s biggest problem may be keeping hold of their 39-year-old coach. Gillespie has already been sounded out by Darren Lehmann for a role within Australia’s set-up, without success, while Michael Vaughan, for one, believes he could be the next England coach. For now Gillespie is very happy as an adopted Yorkshireman and his wife and four children are settled in Leeds. ‘It’s a fantastic job, a dream job, at a big club with lots of challenges,’ he said. ‘I like to think I’ve got a good rapport with everyone I work with and I love working with this group of lads. ‘I’ll never quite get the accent but my kids are all talking like Yorkshiremen. My four-year-old boy just sounds like one and my older two have both got the twang. There’s no hope of my two-year-old daughter having an Aussie accent whatsoever! ‘Look, we’re very happy here and I feel I owe the club. They took a bit of a punt on me. I’d done some coaching in Zimbabwe but my CV wasn’t strong and I’m thankful for the opportunity to repay their faith. I just want to help them achieve their goals.’ Victory over Notts this week would be the perfect start.","output":"Yorkshire's cricket team is close to winning the county championship title, and their success is thanks to a talented group of young players and the guidance of their coach, Jason Gillespie.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye. She was sad but understood that I did the kindest thing I could have done for her kitty.

Short movie review: delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Title: The Paradox of Humanity The movie, \\"The Paradox of Humanity,\\" delves into the intricate and complex relationship between inherent human desires and the constraints imposed by the self-preserving institutions that govern society. Directed by a visionary filmmaker who passionately captures the essence of this struggle, the movie's narrative weaves an intricate tapestry of emotionally charged confrontations and the subtle nuances of power dynamics between individuals and institutions. The cinematography in \\"The Paradox of Humanity\\" is undeniably breathtaking, with sweeping panoramic shots illustrating the vastness and grandeur of the world the characters inhabit. It evokes a sense of longing and an unspoken yearning for freedom, a poignant reflection of the central theme of the movie. The musical score is equally impressive, haunting and enchanting, leaving a lingering impression on the audience and effectively contributing to the movie's emotional depth. The plot revolves around a group of individuals who are caught between their pursuit of personal desires and the expectations imposed upon them by the institutions in which they are situated. The protagonist, a rebellious artist, boldly challenges the societal norms upheld by the governing body of their tightly controlled community. This defiance sets in motion a chain of events that exposes the vulnerability of the individual when faced with the might of a self-preserving institution. As the protagonist's journey unfolds, viewers witness the gradual erosion of their spirit and the diminishing of their once unwavering resolve, ultimately revealing the devastating emotional toll that such conflicts can take upon an individual. The brilliant performances delivered by the ensemble cast convey the raw, visceral agony of the characters, who find themselves shackled by the very systems that were meant to protect them. However, the movie is not without its flaws. While the narrative is powerful and thought-provoking, it at times struggles to maintain a coherent pace, which may leave some viewers feeling disconnected from the story. Additionally, certain supporting characters are underdeveloped, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in their respective arcs. But even with these shortcomings, \\"The Paradox of Humanity\\" remains an impactful and unforgettable cinematic experience. It boldly exposes the inevitable cost of conflicts between human desires and institutional preservation, serving as a cautionary tale of the repercussions that such struggles can inflict upon the individual and society as a whole. Based on the review, the critic seems to think positively of the movie overall. While acknowledging its shortcomings, the critic clearly appreciates the film's thought-provoking subject matter, strong performances, stunning visuals, and compelling music. The movie's potent exploration of the battle between human urges and institutional self-preservation appears to have resonated with the reviewer, suggesting a positive outlook on the film's purpose and impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert is a meat lover.;","output":"[2]. Robert is a meat lover. It is clear that Robert's favorite food is bacon, which implies that he enjoys meat products. Bacon is a popular meat product that is often enjoyed as a breakfast staple, snack, or incorporated into various dishes for additional flavor and texture. As this particular food item is derived from pigs, it is considered a meat product, and thus people who enjoy it can be reasonably categorized as meat lovers. On the other hand, Donald never eats bacon, so the information provided does not support the conclusion that he is a meat lover. There may be several reasons for this. Perhaps Donald avoids bacon for dietary reasons, health concerns, or ethical choices. He may even be a vegetarian or vegan, where eating meat products goes against his beliefs and lifestyle. Moreover, it is important to recognize that even if Donald does consume other types of meat, not eating bacon, in this case, highlights a specific preference or aversion to this particular type of meat. So, labeling him as a meat lover may not accurately capture his dietary inclinations and tastes. In conclusion, the most appropriate option among the two given is that \\"[2]. Robert is a meat lover.\\" as it has been directly mentioned that bacon is Robert's favorite food. As for Donald, there is no sufficient information to identify him as a meat lover, and so option [1] does not accurately describe his preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \\"Photograph\\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth.

I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  Now, I have a new situation: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all.  Answer this question please: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less? A:","output":"Usain  B: Asafa Based on the background information given, cardiac muscle strength and efficiency increases with exercises like running that require the heart to pump more blood. Therefore, between Usain who runs very frequently and Asafa who hardly runs at all, Asafa will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles less. This is because he is not providing the necessary stimulus (frequent running) for his cardiac muscles to get stronger and more efficient. Therefore, the answer is B: Asafa."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  Question: suppose less energy is absorbed by lands happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Based on the given question and process, we can identify that the process under consideration is related to the functioning of the kidneys and urinary system. The process helps to remove waste and toxins from the body through the production and excretion of urine. The stated perturbation is the scenario in which less energy is absorbed by lands. The question that arises from this perturbation is how it will affect the efficiency of waste removal from the body. It is important to clarify the link between the absorption of energy by lands and the functioning of the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in waste removal and the regulation of water and electrolyte balance in the body. They achieve this by filtering blood through nephrons, which are specialized tubule structures designed to separate waste products, excess water, and electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, from the bloodstream. The primary source of energy for the Earth's ecosystems is sunlight, which plants convert into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This energy is then transferred through the food web, as organisms consume plants and one another. However, the direct relationship between the energy absorbed by lands and waste removal seems to be indirect. Nevertheless, under the assumption that less energy absorption by lands might have some impact on waste removal, we can analyze the factors that could be involved and their potential consequences. One possibility is that less energy absorption by lands may lead to decreased primary production at the foundational level of the ecosystem, affecting the availability of resources, such as food and water. This could impact human populations, causing malnourishment and dehydration, which subsequently may result in less waste being produced by the body. In this case, the kidneys would have a decreased load of waste and excess fluids to process, effectively resulting in less waste being removed from the body. In this regard, the perturbation of less energy absorption by lands could lead to a less efficient waste removal system. However, the human body is a highly adaptable system, capable of adjusting to different environmental conditions. In the case of malnourishment and dehydration, the kidneys can regulate the amount of water and electrolytes in the blood, concentrating waste products in the urine to minimize water loss, and synthesizing more waste-processing enzymes to handle any changes in waste composition. In this context, it could be said that the kidneys have the ability to adapt to less available energy, and their waste removal function may not necessarily be negatively affected. In conclusion, the direct link between the absorption of energy by lands and kidney function is not readily apparent. Nevertheless, assuming that less energy absorption might lead to changes in ecosystem structure and resource availability, it could potentially result in less waste removal from the body. However, the human body's adaptability, particularly the kidneys' capability to regulate their function based on changing environmental conditions, suggests the effect might vary depending on individual adaptability and could range from no effect to less efficient waste removal. Given the complexity of these interactions, further research would be necessary to determine the precise impact of this perturbation on the waste removal process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To analyze these sentences, let's first breakdown their meanings: Sentence 1: \\"They'd have been published at once.\\" This sentence implies that if some conditions were met, a work (article, book, or other media) would have been published immediately. There could be various reasons for this immediate publication; it could be due to the urgency, importance, or quality of the work. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention anything about the reputation of the publication platform. Sentence 2: \\"This is one of the most prestigious publications in existence.\\" This sentence describes the stature and prestige of a particular publication platform. It implies that the publication in question holds a high level of importance, influence, or authority within its domain, but it does not relate to the immediacy of the publication process. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these sentences based on the given choices: A). Yes: This would mean that the second sentence is a direct logical consequence of the first one. However, there is no information in the first sentence to clearly indicate any connection to the prestige of the publication. B). It is not possible to tell: This would imply that given the information provided, we cannot discern with certainty whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence or not. Although we might be tempted to pick this option, it's not quite accurate. We can, in fact, reasonably assess that the first sentence doesn't concern the reputation of the publication platform. C). No: This means that the second sentence is not a direct logical consequence of the first sentence. The first sentence deals with the immediacy of publication, while the second sentence concerns the prestige of the publication platform. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that C) no, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. They are addressing two different aspects – the immediacy of the publication process and the reputation of the publication platform – without explicitly connecting the two aspects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? with https data are encrypted using a protocol called the?","output":"The answer to the question is: with https data are encrypted using a protocol called the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS). HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that is used to establish secure, encrypted communication between a user's browser and a web server. This encrypted communication is essential for situations where sensitive data, such as logins, personal data, or financial transactions, need to be transmitted between the client and the server. To encrypt and protect data transmitted over HTTPS, SSL or TLS protocols are employed. Let's delve deeper into these protocols. 1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): SSL was introduced by Netscape in the early 1990s to secure communication between web clients and servers. SSL essentially works by creating a secure channel where data packets are encrypted before being transmitted over the network. SSL uses a combination of public and private key cryptography, along with symmetric key encryption, to ensure the privacy, integrity, and authentication of the data being exchanged. SSL has seen a few iterations since its inception, with SSL 3.0 serving as the last version of the protocol. 2. TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS was developed as the successor of SSL and is considered a more secure and improved version of the protocol. TLS 1.0 was introduced in 1999 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an upgrade to SSL 3.0. The newer TLS versions (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) were subsequently released, each offering improved security features, greater performance, and support for new cryptographic algorithms. Like SSL, TLS also employs public key, private key, and symmetric key encryption for data protection and verification during communication. The transition from SSL to TLS brought multiple enhancements to the table, including better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, support for stronger and more secure cryptographic algorithms, and improved performance and efficiency. In summary, the answer to the question is that data transmitted over HTTPS are encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. These cryptographic protocols ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data exchanged between web clients and servers are well protected and help maintain a higher level of security on the internet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the star of today's story is neither an actor nor musician, but a whopping 150-pound tortoise spotted leisurely strolling in an LA suburb. The residents of the tranquil neighborhood were left stunned by the sight of this giant reptile, leaving everyone with questions about where he came from and how he ended up wandering the streets. It was a typical sunny afternoon in the picturesque Los Angeles suburb when a gentle stroll by one of its residents took a surprising turn. Lianne Beck, a local resident, was taking a leisurely walk when she came across a massive tortoise trundling its way down the street. Beck, in her bewildered state, quickly called the local authorities to report the unusual sighting. The tortoise was discovered to be an African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), one of the largest species of tortoises in the world. These magnificent creatures can live over 100 years and, as their size suggests, can weigh up to 200 pounds. Native to the Sahara Desert, the African spurred tortoise is primarily herbivorous and feeds on grasses and other vegetation. Upon receiving Beck's call, the local animal control was quick to respond and worked tirelessly to safely corral the wandering tortoise. It was later identified that the tortoise had a name — \\"Samson.\\" Samson's identity was determined through a lost pet notice shared by his distraught owners. They had been searching for their beloved pet since he managed to escape from their backyard, taking advantage of an unsecured fence. The reunion between Samson and his owners was heartwarming, as this gentle giant was evidently missed by his family. Samson's owners were extremely grateful for the efforts of the animal control team and the continuous support from the local community during the search. While this story had a happy ending for Samson and his owners, it serves as an important reminder to pet owners regarding the proper care and management of their exotic pets. African spurred tortoises can make fascinating additions to a family but come with specific dietary and environmental requirements that need to be met to ensure their well-being. It is essential for those who wish to keep exotic pets to thoroughly research and understand the needs of their chosen species. Proper housing, the appropriate diet, and the long-term care implications should all be considered. Additionally, environmental enrichment and maintaining a secure enclosure should be prioritized to prevent escapes and potential harm to the animals or local communities. For those who are interested in adopting or caring for exotic animals, it is crucial to reach out to local experts, veterinarians, and wildlife organizations. They can provide valuable guidance and resources to ensure that these extraordinary creatures receive the attention and care they need. In conclusion, the unusual sighting of Samson, the 150-pound tortoise, highlights that our neighborhoods might sometimes surprise us with unexpected guests. His safe return to his loving family is nothing short of heartwarming, and his tale serves as both a cautionary reminder and an inspiring display of community support for exotic pet ownership and responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we are given the information that \\"A man with gray hair and a blond woman [are] sitting on the same side of a table with bikes in the background.\\" Step 2: Identify the claim being evaluated Next, we must determine the claim which we need to evaluate based on the initial statement. Here, the claim is, \\"The man and woman sit on the grass in the park.\\" Step 3: Compare the claim with the provided information Now, we must compare the claim with the information provided in the initial statement. It's important to identify any similarities and differences that may affect whether the claim is logically consistent or contradictory. The initial statement tells us: - A man and a woman are sitting together. - They are on the same side of a table. - There are bikes in the background. The claim states: - The man and woman sit on the grass. - The scene takes place in a park. Step 4: Determine if the claim logically follows from the provided information Upon comparing the claim with the provided information, we find that the claim does not logically follow from the initial statement. While the presence of bikes in the background might suggest an outdoor setting, it is not sufficient to assume that the scene takes place in a park. Moreover, the original statement explicitly says that the man and woman are sitting on the same side of a table, while the claim states that they are sitting on the grass.

First, I found the relative speed of the trains as they are approaching each other. Since they're going towards each other at 60 mph each, their combined speed would be 120 mph (60 + 60).  Next, I converted the speed from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (1 hour is 3600 seconds): 120mph / 3600 = 1/30 miles per second. Afterward, I determined the total length of both trains together: 1/6 mile + 1/6 mile = 1/3 mile. Finally, I divided the total length (1/3 mile) by the relative speed (1/30 miles per second) to find the time it takes for them to pass each other completely: (1/3) / (1/30) = 10 seconds. In the given answer choices, the closest answer choice to 10 seconds is c. 12 sec, so I chose that as the correct answer based on the definition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 - May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay \\"Civil Disobedience\\" (originally published as \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. Thoreau contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with bronchitis. His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly The Maine Woods and Excursions, and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of A Week and Walden. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, \\"I did not know we had ever quarreled.\\"  Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were \\"Now comes good sailing\\", followed by two lone words, \\"moose\\" and \\"Indian\\". He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. Amos Bronson Alcott planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn. Emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral. Thoreau was buried in the Dunbar family plot; his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (42deg27'53''N 71deg20'32''W) in Concord, Massachusetts.  Thoreau's friend William Ellery Channing published his first biography, Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist, in 1873. Channing and another friend, Harrison Blake, edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation. A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by Princeton University Press. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international Thoreau Society and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.  - The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was a NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan, established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386, as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement.

The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Durand Line border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular the Waziristan region and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct low-intensity warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO trainers. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.  - Turkmenistan (or  ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west.  - The Taliban (' \\"students\\"), alternatively spelled Taleban, is an Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement in Afghanistan currently waging war (an insurgency, or jihad) within that country. From 1996 to 2001, it held power in Afghanistan and enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law, of which the international community and leading Muslims have been highly critical.  Until his death in 2013, Mullah Mohammed Omar was the supreme commander and spiritual leader of the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, and following Mansour's killing in a May 2016 U.S. drone strike, Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada became the group's leader.  - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).  - Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world.  - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent.  - The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era.  - Pashto (; \\"Paxt\\" ), also known in older literature as Afghn or Pahn, is the South-Central Asian language of the Pashtuns. Its speakers are called Pashtuns or Pukhtuns and sometimes Afghans or Pathans. It is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are almost 100% Pashto-speaking, while it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 4560 million people worldwide.  - The Leopard 2 is a main battle tank developed by Krauss - Maffei in the 1970s for the West German Army . The tank first entered service in 1979 and succeeded the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the German Army . Various versions have served in the armed forces of Germany and 12 other European countries , as well as several non-European nations . More than 3,480 Leopard 2s have been manufactured . The Leopard 2 was used in Kosovo with the German Army and has also seen action in Afghanistan with the Danish and Canadian contributions to the International Security Assistance Force . There are two main development batches of the tank , the original models up to Leopard 2A4 , which have vertically faced turret armour , and the \`\` improved '' batch , namely the Leopard 2A5 and newer versions , which have angled arrow - shaped turret appliqué armour together with other improvements . All models feature digital fire control systems with laser rangefinders , a fully stabilized main gun and coaxial machine gun , and advanced night vision and sighting equipment ( first vehicles used a low - light level TV system or LLLTV ; thermal imaging was introduced later on ) . The tank has the ability to engage moving targets while moving over rough terrain .  - The Bundeswehr (\\"Federal Defence\\") is the unified armed forces of Germany and their civil administration and procurement authorities. The States of Germany are not allowed to maintain armed forces of their own, since the German Constitution states that matters of defense fall into the sole responsibility of the federal government.  - Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan  Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes.

Movie title: The Damned United Context: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final.

Write the next sentence. New Zealand easily chased down 105 to complete an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and make it five Test-match victories in a year for the first time. Captain Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealander to hit 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year when he made a rapid 195 in the first innings in Christchurch. But he was not needed in the second as Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor knocked off the runs required once opening pair Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford had been dismissed. New Zealand's captain Brendon McCullum continued his rich Test scoring streak with 195 against Sri Lanka With his century in","output":"the first innings, McCullum not only established a new personal best but also solidified his position as a prolific run scorer in the Test arena for New Zealand. His leadership both on and off the field, combined with his aggressive style of play, inspired his teammates to perform at their best, as demonstrated by the success of Williamson and Taylor in the second innings in Christchurch. Kane Williamson, a talented batsman with a vast array of shots, played a crucial role in the chase, exhibiting strong technique and great temperament throughout his innings. His partnership with the experienced Ross Taylor ensured stability and the momentum needed for a successful run chase. Taylor's aggressive approach and outstanding stroke play consistently put pressure on the Sri Lankan bowlers, making it difficult for them to settle into a consistent rhythm. The Sri Lankan bowling attack, led by Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep, struggled to make an impact against the formidable New Zealand batting lineup. While they managed to claim a few early wickets in both innings, they could not maintain the pressure and couldn't capitalise on the breakthroughs. The lack of a potent spin bowler to exploit the pitch conditions also proved to be an advantage for the New Zealand batsmen. Apart from their batting prowess, what truly stood out for the Kiwis was their outstanding fielding and bowling efforts. The seamers, led by Trent Boult and Tim Southee, consistently bowled a tight line, making it difficult for the Sri Lankan batsmen to score freely. In addition to their bowling exploits, both Boult and Southee showcased their athletic abilities in the field, resulting in spectacular catches and run-outs that further fuelled the New Zealand side. As New Zealand celebrated their fifth Test-match victory of the year, the team reflected on their steady progression to becoming one of the cricket world's elite sides. The growth in confidence, the presence of several world-class players, and a strong team culture facilitated by their experienced captain, has set them up for continued success in the coming years. For Sri Lanka, this series served as a reminder of the need to adapt and develop a more consistent and disciplined approach to Test cricket, especially when playing away from home. Developing a potent bowling lineup capable of exploiting various pitch conditions, coupled with a batting lineup that can hold their own against top-quality seam attacks, will be Sri Lanka's primary focus moving forward. In conclusion, New Zealand's eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka symbolised the rise of a team capable of dominating the longer format of the game. Led by a captain who made history in the process, this match exemplified the depth and skill present within the New Zealand squad. For Sri Lanka, the defeat underscored the need for improvement and growth to once again compete at the highest level in Test cricket. As cricket fans, we eagerly await the future duels between these two sides and the exciting cricket that will undoubtedly unfold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Whose control the phantom of Ilsa remained? Movie plot title: The Terror Movie plot: Set in 1806, the film tells the story of a lost French soldier in the Confederation of the Rhine named Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) who is saved by a strange young woman named Helene (Sandra Knight). She looks like Ilsa, the wife of the baron (played by Boris Karloff), who died twenty years before. Investigating who the woman really is, Andre stumbles upon a hidden secret of the Baron: After he found Ilsa sleeping with another man named Eric, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed Eric, or so he explains. All the while, the phantom of Ilsa remained under the control of a peasant witch (Dorothy Neumann), who has commanded the ghost to torment the Baron for the previous two years. Over the course of the film, Ilsa's ghost beseeches the Baron to kill himself, so they could be together. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so, perhaps to atone for his crimes. During the climactic scenes, Andre, as well as the Baron's butler Stefan (Dick Miller), try to stop him, eventually forcing the witch into compliance. Here it is revealed that the witch Katrina is in fact the mother of Eric, who she believes was killed by the Baron twenty years before, and that is why she has tried to make him commit suicide and damn his soul to hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric never died, that it was the Baron who was killed. Eric then took the Baron's place, living his life until he deluded himself into thinking he was the Baron. Katrina, realizing her folly only too late, goes with the two men to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt and killing himself. However, she is unable to go into the mausoleum and ends up being struck by lightning and burning to death to the ground as she tries to escape. In the climax of the film, Ilsa's ghost attempts to kill Eric while the crypt floods, and Stefan joins the struggle.

Summarize the following: The diaphragm is a muscle that sits like an upside-down bowl just beneath your ribs, contracting and relaxing to move air through your lungs. Deep \\"belly breathing\\" that visibly moves your abdomen in and out helps strengthen this muscle and improve your endurance. If your belly stays flat and your chest pumps up and down, you're taking shallow \\"chest breaths,\\" and will fatigue sooner. This will help ensure that you are getting enough oxygen to your body, and is the best way to prevent muscle and lung fatigue.  It also helps increase endurance by getting proper oxygen circulation to your muscles. Your mouth is wider than your nostrils, allowing you to take deeper breaths of air. Allow air to enter through both your mouth and your nose. Most experienced runners coordinate their breath with their steps, such as the popular \\"inhale for three steps, exhale for two\\" (or simply \\"3–2\\"). This helps you breathe more consistently. You may also be forced to switch to a different pattern (such as \\"2–1\\") at higher speeds, which helps you keep track of the intensity of your run. There are several popular alternatives to these patterns, such as \\"2-2\\" or \\"2-3.\\" Experiment with different breathing patterns to find the right one for you. You should be able to form full sentences while running without huffing and puffing.","output":"The diaphragm, an essential muscle for respiration, is situated just below the ribs, resembling an inverted bowl. It contracts and relaxes to facilitate airflow in and out of the lungs. Engaging in deep \\"belly breathing,\\" characterized by abdominal movements, aids in strengthening the diaphragm and improving endurance. Shallow \\"chest breaths,\\" on the other hand, may lead to quicker exhaustion. Optimizing oxygen intake is crucial for preventing muscle and lung fatigue while also enhancing endurance through sufficient oxygen circulation in the muscles. Breathing through the mouth, which is wider than the nostrils, allows for deeper inhalation. Combining mouth and nose breathing is recommended for maximum efficiency. Seasoned runners often synchronize their breathing with their strides. A common pattern is \\"inhale for three steps, exhale for two\\" (or \\"3-2\\"). Such coordination enables consistent breathing and can be adjusted to different patterns, like \\"2-1,\\" depending on the running speed and intensity.

Having a conversation about sexual issues can be difficult and awkward, especially if you are both feeling the lack of sexual chemistry in the bedroom. Don’t spring the conversation on your partner when you’re having dinner at a restaurant or surrounded by friends. Look for a time when you are both alone, in a private space, to bring up the topic. A good time may be when you are both getting ready for bed, or after you have dinner together at home. A big part of strengthening the sexual relationship between you and your spouse is maintaining open and honest communication between you and your spouse. Bringing up the sexual issues in your marriage will show you are trying to make sex a priority in your relationship, instead of an occasional occurrence. Perhaps you have grown distant from your spouse or your spouse has grown distant from you. Regardless, be proactive and get the conversation started. Let your spouse know that you realize it’s important to have an intimate connection in a relationship, especially in a marriage. Tell your spouse that you realize you have both been unhappy with your love life and that you want to try to do something about it. If your partner responds with, “Well, I’ve heard that before”, don’t take it personally. Instead, ask your partner how you can meet their needs, sexual and otherwise. Discuss what your partner feels is lacking in your sexual relationship and what you feel is lacking, as well.  Often, couples with sexual problems also have other emotional issues that have not been worked out and are hovering over the relationship. You could be lacking sexual chemistry due to boredom in the bedroom, a low sex drive (for you or your partner), a negative body image (for you or your partner), exhaustion due to the stresses of life, or a lack of connection mentally and emotionally.  Try to work together to identify possible causes of your lack of sexual chemistry. It can be difficult to talk about issues around sex. But as partners, you owe it to each other to be honest and to share any concerns around intimacy and sex. Don’t interrupt your partner when your partner is sharing any feelings or concerns. Focus on listening before you respond or speak. Try to get to the root of your issues. Don’t be afraid to be specific about your concerns, as this can lead to solutions to address them. If your partner brings up a feeling of boredom in the bedroom, think of ways to spice up your usual sex routine. Maybe your partner is feeling exhausted by their workday, or experiencing a negative image of their body. Discuss possible solutions to these issues, like taking less hours at work, going on a vacation just the two of you, or taking up exercise together.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions.    That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment.    This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases:    \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger)    The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions?

Article: The label, Made in China, is one that is becoming increasing popular in shopping centers all over the world. In the United States, shoppers at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer , have a wide selection of products mostly produced in China. The large amount of Chinese imports have created a large selection of goods in other countries as people begin to buy more and more products made in China. These goods are even widely available in other Asian nations, where Chinese-made goods are quite popular. Chinese _ names are also becoming more well-known outside China, such as Gree,Media and Huawei. When Chinese Americans visit family and friends in their homeland, gifts from the U.S. are a must.

New Delhi (CNN) -- India's parliament on Saturday debated demands by a 74-year-old anti-corruption activist in what an opposition leader called a \\"historic occasion\\" for lawmakers to come together in the fight against graft. The discussion came on the 12th day of campaigner Anna Hazare's hunger strike calling for a powerful Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman, to deal with massive bribes and kickbacks. Talks with the government hit a roadblock over three of his demands, which include bringing members of India's lower bureaucracy under the new watchdog.

Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe?

Given the question: What's the last name of the man that will pay for Eliza's lessons, if successful?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.  Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \\"gets it\\" (\\"The Rain in Spain\\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent (\\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\"). The answer is:","output":"Pickering.

Q: Got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  Pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  Food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistic terms refers to a relationship between two sentences, where the truth of one sentence (the entailing sentence) guarantees or implies the truth of the other sentence (the entailed sentence). If one sentence is true, then the other must also be true in order for the relationship to be considered entailment. In this case, the two sentences have different meanings and do not guarantee or imply each other's truth. Let's analyze each sentence separately: 1. \\"Otherwise--Well, I guess I can do it on my own.\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker is considering two options or scenarios, one of which involves doing the task \\"on their own,\\" i.e., without help or support from others. It implies that the speaker is capable of handling the situation independently. The use of \\"well\\" and \\"guess\\" in the sentence may indicate a degree of uncertainty or hesitation, but the speaker still concludes that they can do it on their own. 2. \\"I can't do it alone.\\" This sentence has a different meaning, as it involves the speaker admitting that they are not capable of accomplishing the task by themselves. They need help or support from others in order to complete the task successfully. Here, the speaker expresses a clear inability to do the task alone. Based on these interpretations, the two sentences convey different meanings and do not entail each other. If anything, they express contradictory positions regarding the speaker's capability to handle the task independently. The first sentence implies that the speaker can potentially do the task on their own, whereas the second sentence directly states the speaker's inability to do it alone. Thus, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as their meanings do not guarantee or imply each other's truth, and they, in fact, express opposite viewpoints."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"Vlach\\" is etymologically derived from the ethnonym of a Celtic tribe, adopted into Proto-Germanic *Walhaz which meant \\"stranger\\", from *Wolka- (Caesar's Latin: Volcae, Strabo and Ptolemy's Greek: Ouolkai).  Via Latin, in Gothic, as *walhs, the ethnonym took on the meaning \\"foreigner\\" or \\"Romance-speaker\\", and was adopted into Greek Vlahi (Blakhoi), Slavic Vlah, Hungarian olah and olasz, etc. The root word was notably adopted in Germanic for Wales and Walloon (German: Welsch), and in Poland Wlochy became an exonym for Italians. Via both Germanic and Latin, the term started to signify \\"stranger, foreigner\\" also in the Balkans, where it in its early form was used for Romance-speakers, but the term eventually took on the meaning of \\"shepherd, nomad\\". The Romance-speaking communities themselves however used the endonym (they called themselves) \\"Romans\\". During the early history of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, there was a social class of Vlachs in Serbia and Macedonia, made up of Christians who served as auxiliary forces and had the same rights as Muslims. In Croatia, the term became derogatory, and Vlasi was used for the ethnic Serb community.  Romanian scholars have suggested that the term Vlach appeared for the first time in the Eastern Roman Empire and was subsequently spread to the Germanic- and then Slavic-speaking worlds through the Norsemen (possibly by Varangians), who were in trade and military contact with Byzantium during the early Middle Ages (see also Blakumen).

Pi tells his story to Yann: Pi's father names him Piscine Molitor after the swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the name \\"Pi\\" (the Greek letter, Ï) to avoid the sound-alike nickname \\"Pissing Patel\\". He is raised Hindu and vegetarian, but at 12 years old, is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he \\"just wants to love God\\".

After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat. When Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a member of the crew throws him into a lifeboat.

Her full name is Jane Ives, later changed to Jane Hopper when Chief Jim Hopper became her adopted father. She is portrayed by the talented young actress Millie Bobby Brown. Eleven, also known as \\"El\\" among her friends, was born with psychokinetic and telepathic abilities due to her mother, Terry Ives, being unknowingly subjected to experimentation while she was pregnant with her. As a result, the young Eleven was taken from her mother at birth and raised within the confines of the Hawkins National Laboratory, where she was subjected to a series of experiments and tests. Eleven's backstory forms a crucial part of the narrative of \\"Stranger Things.\\" Throughout the series, we see Eleven largely isolated from the outside world, with virtually no exposure to the norms of society or interaction with individuals other than her captors and handlers. In Season 1, she escapes from the laboratory and comes across a group of young boys - Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair. They help her and eventually form a strong bond with her, teaching her about friendship and the outside world. Eleven's character arc sees her grow from a sheltered and frightened girl into a brave and powerful young woman, who plays a pivotal role in saving her friends and the town of Hawkins from supernatural threats originating from the \\"Upside Down,\\" a dark parallel universe. Over the course of the series, Eleven's gender identity is not questioned, although her androgynous appearance initially confuses the boys when they first meet her. Eleven's personal journey includes her discovering what it means to be a girl, as she experiences various milestones such as shopping for clothes, being a sister figure to Will's (Mike's younger brother) younger sister, Holly, and later having romantic feelings for Mike Wheeler, one of her friends from the group. In conclusion, not only is Eleven from \\"Stranger Things\\" a girl, but her character development also incorporates the exploration of her identity and femininity despite the adverse circumstances she was raised in. The series showcases her bravery, resilience, and emotional journey as she learns about herself and the world around her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A referendum has been called for 5 July, with Greeks being asked to decide whether or not to accept a series of reforms set out by their government's international creditors. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is backing a No vote and a succession of European leaders are describing the referendum as a choice between staying in the euro or leaving it. So what are the main scenarios now? One route certainly preferred by the creditor side - the eurozone countries, the IMF and the European Central Bank - is a political breakthrough: a deal is done and Greece will stay in the eurozone and pay its debts. But a deal that lets Greece receive the funds in time to make the â‚¬1.6bn payment due to the IMF by 22:00 GMT on Tuesday now looks virtually impossible. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was said to have made a last-ditch offer to the Greek prime minister late on Monday on condition that he backed a Yes vote, but the Athens government's initial response was negative. Still, contacts are continuing and there appears to be some possibility of an agreement in the coming days. For a deal to go through, the eurozone would have to agree to resuscitate the bailout agreement that also expires on Tuesday. But if that were the price of keeping Greece in the fold, most eurozone governments would probably grudgingly pay it, though some would have to deal with truculent national parliaments. Another possible route to that same destination is a Yes vote in the Greek referendum next weekend. That would raise the same questions about the agreement and it would mean a difficult political problem for Syriza, which is recommending a No. The leftist party has the backing of its nationalist coalition partner, Independent Greeks, as well as the far-right Golden Dawn. Mainstream opposition parties such as the centre-right New Democracy are backing a Yes vote. Two opinion polls suggest more Greeks want a deal than a split from the eurozone, but the surveys were conducted before the referendum was announced. One problem for both these scenarios is that even if the Syriza-led government were to commit itself to an economic policy programme acceptable to the eurozone, would its other 18 members trust Greece to implement it? If Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has staked his reputation on a No vote, were to lose the referendum, his credibility would be damaged and he might resign. What's the point of the Greek referendum? The puzzle of the Greek referendum question This scenario would herald a long period of uncertainty and crisis, ending with Greece departing the eurozone and bringing back its own national currency, presumably with the same name as the old one, the drachma. This would be a very messy series of events. It would probably involve the European Central Bank deciding to pull the plug on all or most lending to the Greek banks on the grounds that it considered them insolvent. In the run-up to that it is likely there would be a considerable period of restrictions on access to and use of bank accounts - more of what started this week.  It would be very disruptive for the Greek economy, which is already back in recession. The government would decide to start supplying national currency - electronic and hard cash - to get the banking system up and running. What would happen to the restored drachma? The general assumption is it would lose value. That would also pose a danger of inflation as import prices would rise. There would be disputes about financial aspects of contracts: which currency would apply - euros or drachmas?  Perhaps the government would legislate quickly in an attempt to settle the question. What are capital controls? Greek debt jargon explained Another scenario is a negotiated exit from the euro. That might be somewhat less disruptive.  But it would still leave bank customers looking at their money being converted into drachma. One issue with both no-vote scenarios is what happens to Greece's European Union membership. According to one of the ECB's lawyers, writing in 2009, \\"a Member State's exit from EMU, without a parallel withdrawal from the EU, would be legally inconceivable\\". But what if Greece did not want to leave, as currently seems likely? There's no expulsion procedure and in any case might the others at least want it inside the EU even if they have given up on keeping it in the eurozone? They could change the EU treaties, but that is a very difficult process with all sorts of bear traps, including referendums in some member states. Or they could just muddle through with a situation that has no legal basis. If Greece does leave, what are the implications for the integrity of the rest of the eurozone? In 2012, when the possibility was in the air, other countries with stretched government finances felt the impact through the bond market, where government debt is traded. Their borrowing costs rose to painfully high levels. Would it happen this time? The risks are probably less, due to actions taken by the governments concerned, eurozone governments collectively and especially by the European Central Bank. In the longer term the significance might be that a Greek departure would send the message that membership of the euro is not forever, as it was intended to be. So a country getting into difficulty in the future might then find the pressure in the financial markets on their borrowing costs more severe because of what had happened in the case of Greece. Will Europe catch Greek 'flu? Is Grexit inevitable? Summary:","output":"A Greek referendum on whether to accept a series of reforms set out by international creditors has been scheduled for July 5th. With payment of &euro;1.6bn due to the IMF on June 30th, it appears virtually impossible for Greece to receive bailout funds in time to make the payment. If no agreement is reached, Greece would face a long period of uncertainty, crisis, and departure from the eurozone, potentially leading to the reintroduction of the drachma as its national currency. A negotiated exit from the eurozone is another possible scenario, but would still entail financial disruption. If Greece leaves the eurozone, other countries with stretched government finances may experience rising borrowing costs in the bond market, though the risks are likely less than in 2012."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:     Choices:  - irrigation  - plowing  - sowing  - crop rotation   A: Answer:","output":"The agricultural practice of restoring nitrogen to the soil as mentioned in the question is crop rotation. Crop rotation is a technique that has been used for centuries by many different civilizations to maintain soil fertility and ensure a productive harvest. This method involves systematically changing the type of crop planted in a specific area over a period of time. By doing so, the soil's nutrients are better balanced, and soil exhaustion is prevented. Nitrogen is a crucial element for plant growth, as it is a primary component of chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. It is also a major component of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Unfortunately, certain crops like corn or rice tend to deplete the nitrogen content in the soil, thereby affecting the productivity of the land. Crop rotation helps to restore nitrogen levels in the soil by including nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes, in the rotation cycle. Legumes (for example, beans, peas, and clover) have a unique ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere using bacteria that form nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a form that can be absorbed by plants. When legumes are grown as part of a crop rotation system, they add nitrogen back into the soil, making it available for other crops. Apart from restoring nitrogen, crop rotation also offers several other benefits: 1. Pest and disease control: Different crops attract different types of pests and diseases. By changing the crop planted in a specific area, the pest and disease cycles are disrupted, helping to reduce their impact. 2. Improved soil structure and fertility: Continuously planting the same crop leads to soil depletion and decreased soil health. Crop rotation allows the soil to recover from the demands of a specific crop, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and promoting healthy soil ecosystems. 3. Weed control: Different crops compete with weeds differently. Including crops with allelopathic properties, which produce chemicals that inhibit the growth of competing plants, can help suppress weeds in the long run. 4. Diversifying farm income: By growing different types of crops, farmers can reduce their reliance on a single cash crop, thereby reducing income fluctuations and ensuring better economic stability. In conclusion, crop rotation is the agricultural practice primarily used for restoring nitrogen to the soil. This technique not only maintains soil fertility but also has numerous other benefits, such as pest and disease control, improved soil structure, weed management, and diversification of farm income."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Threads Movie plot: It is March, 1984. In Sheffield, England, young Ruth Beckett & Jimmy Kemp are out in the country above Sheffield when a U.S. F-4 Phantom flies past overhead from the nearby R.A.F. Finningley base. Sheffield, the 4th-largest city in Britain, is close to a prominent R.A.F. Base and also has a major component of steel, energy & chemical production. Jimmy flicks through the car's radio stations, missing a brief news story about a Soviet invasion of Iran in his attempt to find the broadcast of the latest football game. Ruth chastises him for his lack of taste, but after he gets out of the car & comes back with a flower the two start to kiss.Later that week, the BBC runs a story about a Soviet convoy moving through northern Iran. The convoys had apparently been spotted by U.S. satellites, traversing 3 of the mountain passes leading from the USSR. The story goes on to say the Soviet foreign minister had defiantly defended the invasion, and it soon becomes obvious that the Soviets are hoping to convert Iran to yet another Soviet satellite state. During this time frame Ruth also reveals to Jimmy she is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby. When Jimmy informs his parents his father reacts somewhat harshly; his mother tries to point out all the options available to them. Jimmy informs his parents that he & Ruth plan to get married and have the child. Jimmy works for a carpentry firm; it is not clear what Ruth works as. Michael, Jimmy's annoying younger brother, humiliates him in front of his sister Alison by mentioning the upcoming pregnancy, which provokes an angry reaction from both Jimmy and his mother.Soon after, the U.S. states it will send troops to Iran if the USSR doesn't cease its invasion. The Soviets apparently ignore the warning, and soon after U.S. paratroops go in near the Soviet base at Moshad in northern Iran. Hoping the USSR will back off, the British prime minister issues a statement of support for the U.S. action. Unfortunately the USSR ignores the international condemnation, and as Ruth & Jimmy's...

By Jill Reilly PUBLISHED: 10:05 EST, 10 May 2013 | UPDATED: 19:31 EST, 10 May 2013 Jimi Hendrix wanted Sir Paul  McCartney to form a supergroup with him – and be its bass player. He sent a telegram inviting the Beatle to join forces with him, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and drummer Tony Williams in 1969, as the Fab Four were breaking up. It read: ‘We are recording and (sic) LP together this weekend. How about coming in to play bass?’ It was sent to McCartney at The Beatles’ Apple Records HQ in London on October 21, 1969, and told him to get in touch with producer Alan Douglas. It is not clear either how McCartney's melodic, subtle bass playing would have made its presence felt in a band that included Hendrix' guitar and","output":"Davis' trumpet, but the prospect of such a collaboration is intriguing. While the telegram paints a picture of an impromptu recording session, it's likely that Hendrix, Davis, and Williams had discussed the idea beforehand. Unfortunately, McCartney never received the telegram in time. According to McCartney's aide Peter Brown, he was on holiday and didn't see the message until he returned. By that point, the weekend had already passed, and the recording session never materialized. The story ends with a sense of wonder and curiosity about what might have been had the supergroup come together. As history unfolded, each musician went on to achieve continued success in their individual careers. Hendrix, tragically, died less than a year later, in September 1970, at the age of 27. Davis and Williams both passed away in the 1990s, leaving McCartney as the sole surviving member of this group of legendary musicians.

Now, we will isolate x by following these sub-steps: a. Subtract 198 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side of the equation. b. Divide both sides of the equation by -11 to solve for x. Sub-step a: -11*x + 198 - 198 = -121 - 198 -11*x = -319 Sub-step b: -11*x / -11 = -319 / -11 x = 29 And the answer is x = 29."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.

Article: When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative  . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine...

More gun violence plays out on the big screen in movies open to all ages than in R-rated box office blockbusters, reports FastCo.Exist. Researchers found that gun violence in PG-13 action movies is on the rise with Hollywood increasingly relying on shoot-'em-up scenes to fill seats. Building on an earlier study, they sampled 30 top-grossing films between 2012 and 2015 to determine the number of five-minute segments in which a character fires a gun at someone. Writing in the journal Pediatrics, they report the rate of gun violence in PG-13 movies in 2012 equaled that of R-rated films, restricted to 17 and older, and outpaced those films in later years. Kids of all ages are allowed into cinemas showing PG-13 movies, though parents are \\"strongly cautioned.\\" Some of the most violent PG-13 films were some of the most popular like 2015's Star Wars: the Force Awakens.\\" (See the full list here.) Of note: The authors say films often remove the consequences of gunplay. Thus, children and their parents are being \\"desensitized\\" to these effects, they contend, comparing on-screen bloodshed to behaviors like smoking and drinking that can young people often imitate. Previous research has shown that repeated exposure to violence on screen can make kids more aggressive. \\"We know less about the potential effects of films that glorify the use of guns,\\" the authors write. Until more is known, they say, pediatricians should advise parents \\"to be cautious about exposing their children\\" to violent films. (Violent superheroes can make kids more aggressive.)","output":"Sometimes people think that PG-13 movies are less violent than R-rated movies. But guess what? That's not always true! Researchers found out that there is more gun violence in PG-13 movies than in R-rated ones. This means that even though kids of all ages can watch PG-13 movies, they can still see lots of violence. Researchers picked 30 popular movies from 2012 to 2015 to see how many times a character shoots a gun at someone. They found out that in 2012, PG-13 movies had as much gun violence as R-rated ones. In later years, there was even more gun violence in PG-13 movies. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an example of a very popular but also violent PG-13 movie. The authors, or people who did this research, noticed that movies often don't show the bad things that happen because of guns. This can make kids and their parents less worried about gun violence. They compared it to how kids often copy behaviors like smoking and drinking that they see in movies. Studies have shown that watching violence on screen can make kids more aggressive. The authors wanted to make sure parents and doctors knew about this. They said that until we know more, parents should be careful about letting their kids watch violent movies. And doctors should talk to parents about this too. So, it's important to remember that even PG-13 movies can have a lot of violence and we should be careful about what we watch!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Officers Benjamin Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 25, were killed in Hattiesburg city, said police spokesman Lt Jon Traxler. Local media say that both men died from their injuries in the hospital on Saturday night. Four people have been arrested over the killings, ending a manhunt of several hours. Warren Strain, spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said that 29-year-old Marvin Banks and 22-year-old Joanie Calloway had both been charged with two counts of capital murder. Cornelius Clark, 28, was arrested later and charged with obstruction of justice, the Mississippi Highway Patrol said, according to the Associated Press. Mr Strain said that Curtis Banks, the younger brother of Marvin Banks, had also been charged with being an accessory to the crimes. It's not clear what warranted those charges. Mr Strain told The Associated Press that Marvin Banks had tried to escape in a police car after the shooting. \\"He didn't get very far, three or four blocks and then he ditched that vehicle.\\" According to his mother, Mary Smith, Mr Banks has mental problems in addition to a drug addiction. She said that her son smoked \\"spice\\" daily and had been hearing voices ever since he was attacked and hit in the head with a pipe several years ago. She told AP that she has no doubt that Marvin killed the officers and said he looked high in photos after his arrest. \\"You could tell something was wrong with him,\\" she said, speaking on the steps of the courthouse, where she had come to find out more information about her sons' arrest. \\"I hate it for these families that he wasn't in his right mind.\\" The shootings took place after one of the police officers pulled over a car on Saturday, local reports say. \\"All I know right now is that there was a traffic stop and someone started shooting at them and both of the officers were struck,\\" Lt Traxler told AP. The number of shots and who fired them were still under investigation, he added. He did not explain why the car had been pulled over by police. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the officers' deaths \\"is made even more tragic by the fact that, on the day they were killed this past Saturday, the country began observing Police Week - a time when we pause to remember and honour the more than 20,000 law enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of duty\\". The incident comes after the killing of a New York police officer last week. Brian Moore, 25, was shot in the head while attempting to question a suspect from his police car. In December, two officers were shot dead in their car in New York by a man who then committed suicide. The latest shootings come amid heightened tensions in the US over the police's use of force. Riots erupted in Baltimore earlier this month after the death of a 24-year-old black man in police custody. Six officers have since been charged over the death of Freddie Gray.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Answer the following question: Q: For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge. Neuronal Charged Membranes The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.   Choices:  - pulses  - proteins  - information  - signals   A: Answer:","output":"For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may not be interested in volunteering or attaining a job—that's okay. Helping out others is only a recommendation. However, many volunteers report that their work makes them feel good; some volunteer work can even help with self-development.  Consider the benefits and drawbacks of volunteer work or jobs, and use this to decide whether you'll help others out. You don't have to get a job when you're a teenager—and when you're under a certain age, it's nearly impossible to find one—but that doesn't mean that you're unable to help out! Consider volunteering, doing odd jobs for others, or helping someone to learn something they don't know. This can do wonders to help other people! It will be helpful for future employment after college to have a job or volunteer so you can have valuable work experience. . Volunteering doesn't have to happen outside of the home. If you have an internet connection, you can volunteer online—for example, editing wikiHow articles about your favorite subjects. Are you interested in animals? Volunteer at an animal shelter or collect supplies for your local non-profit shelter. Are you good with people? Find a job or volunteer work that's oriented around talking to others. Can you design complex web pages with minimal effort? Offer to help others learn web design. Take your talents and interests and find something you can do based around those. It can be a great help to volunteer or work, and have fun at the same time! If one of your talents is that you're an all-A's scholar, see if there's a program at your school that allows you to tutor struggling students. If not, try asking families that have younger kids or advertising a tutoring service—you may get some great opportunities!   It's okay to turn down a tutoring offer. If you can't tutor the neighbor's son because he's too loud and disruptive, or if you aren't good at a subject that somebody needs help with, it's okay to politely say, \\"I'm sorry, I can't do that job\\" or \\"I don't think your child and I work together very well\\". You can either choose to get paid for tutoring or do it for free. If you do choose to make it a job, however, don't overcharge. Few people will hire you if you charge ten dollars an hour! Some organizations will host activities to donate to certain causes—for example, walks to support cancer research collect money and donate it to groups that do cancer research. Other activities seek to spread awareness of illnesses, or acceptance of disabled people. Consider participating in these.  Be sure you know what group the activity is supporting. Some groups are well known for being surrounded by controversy. Do careful research on an organization before participating in any of their events. You don't want to support something that causes more harm than good. You don't need to participate in giant volunteer organizations to make a difference. Consider doing basic things to help people have a brighter day—compliment your classmate's poem, tell someone they look fantastic, help somebody pick up their things if they drop them, hold the door open for others who are struggling to carry things, and so forth. Something that seems little to you can turn someone else's entire day around. Get out there, and help to make the world a better place by making others' lives more enjoyable!","output":"The article encourages readers to consider the benefits of volunteering and helping others, suggesting various ways to contribute based on personal interests and talents while being aware of the organizations supported and understanding it's okay to decline if they feel unable to fulfill a task."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite her personal fears, Samantha would still tag along with Felicia because she could sense how much her friend enjoyed the lake boardwalk and the lively atmosphere it offered. It was a warm and sunny afternoon as the birds chirped softly in the backdrop of the laughter that filled the air. Felicia and Samantha sat on a wooden bench facing the clear turquoise water, which sparkled under the golden sun. Felicia stretched her legs, enjoying the warmth of the sun on her skin, as she watched children playing on the sandy beach and people splashing each other while on paddle boats, creating ripples like tiny waves across the calm surface. \\"The lake is so beautiful today,\\" Felicia sighed with contentment. Samantha simply nodded, though her grip on the edge of the bench was so tight that her knuckles had turned white. Felicia frowned, sensing her friend's unease, and decided it was high time to find a way to help Samantha get past her fears. \\"Hey, Sam?\\" Felicia began, her voice gentle and full of concern. \\"You know, I've been thinking. We've been coming to the lake so many times, and I've noticed how it makes you feel. I was wondering if you want to talk about it?\\" Samantha swallowed hard but didn't say anything right away, her eyes still fixated on the water. Felicia reached out to place a reassuring hand on her friend's, feeling how cold and clammy it felt even on a hot summer day. \\"You don't have to if you're not comfortable, but I thought it might help. I just want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what.\\" Samantha let out a shaky breath, her shoulders slightly relaxed as she spoke. \\"When I was little, maybe six or seven, my family came to the lake for a picnic. I wandered off to explore and got too close to the edge of the water… and I slipped in.\\" She shuddered at the memory, her face turning pale. \\"I didn't know how to swim, and I panicked as the water closed over my head. I was so sure I was going to drown.\\" Tears began to well up in Samantha's eyes, but she continued. \\"My dad pulled me out, but from then on, I've always been scared of the lake… of any being near open water.\\" Felicia looked at her friend with a mix of sympathy and determination. \\"Sam, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. But you know what? I think we can work on this together.\\" Samantha raised an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity shining through her apprehension. \\"How are we going to do that?\\" Samantha asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"Let's start small. Let's just take off our shoes and socks and put our feet in the water. That's it. I'll be right beside you the whole time, I promise,\\" Felicia said reassuringly. Samantha looked hesitant, but after a few deep breaths, she agreed to give it a try. Together, the two friends walked to the water's edge, their hands linked for support. With gentle encouragement, Felicia helped Samantha dip her toes in the crystal-blue water, both of them watching in awe as the ripples spread across the surface like a piece of abstract art. Over time, Samantha grew more comfortable being near the lake, thanks to Felicia's unwavering support. Though she may never completely overcome her fear, she came to cherish her time by the water, with her treasured friend, enjoying the warmth of a strong bond that could never be erased by the tides of their fears - a bond that molded and evolved, just like the shimmering reflections dancing upon the serene waters of the lake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So it’s all unfortunate. One dumb thing led to another .... and then becomes a big incendiary story.” Casale, 67, apologized after TMZ.com published the photos Monday and reported that real box cutters like the kind Al Qaeda terrorists used were given out as favors. “I understand why those pictures would offend people,” he told The News. “The cake was such bad taste.” Best known as a founding member of the pioneering post-punk rock band Devo, Casale said earlier a friend showed up with the cake and that it was a \\"surprise.\\" \\"I joked and said Krista and I are like the twin towers of love and love conquers all and we're going to resurrect those towers,\\" said Casale, who is 41 years older than his 26-year-old bride.

Bad choice.” Deep apologies for all offended. There is a real explanation and its not what you think. Surprise cake and pix to TMZ was a set up. TBC...

Sir David Frederick Attenborough  (UK: ; born 8 May 1926) is an English broadcaster and naturalist. He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a special programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird.  Attenborough was named the most trusted celebrity in the UK in a 2006 Reader's Digest poll, and in 2007 he won The Culture Show's Living Icon Award. He has also been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten \\"Heroes of Our Time\\" according to New Statesman magazine.  In September 2009, London's Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development. In December 2013, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Bristol.  In 2012, Attenborough was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork - the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. The same year, Attenborough featured in the BBC Radio 4 series The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK \\"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands\\".  In May 2016, it was announced that a new British polar research ship will be named RRS Sir David Attenborough in his honour. While an Internet poll suggesting the name of the ship had the most votes for Boaty McBoatface, Science Minister Jo Johnson said there were \\"more suitable names\\", and the official name was eventually picked up from one of the more favoured choices.

Does this mean that \\"The cloud was out.\\"? Available options:  (a). no  (b). yes","output":"(a). No \\"The sun was covered by a thick cloud all morning, but luckily, by the time the picnic started, it was out.\\" This sentence does not mean \\"The cloud was out.\\" Rather, it suggests that the sun was out, implying the cloud that had been blocking the sun for the entire morning had either dissipated or moved, thereby allowing the sun to shine. \\"The cloud was out\\" is not equivalent to the original sentence because having the cloud \\"out\\" generally means that the cloud is present or visible, potentially blocking the sun. In the context of the sentence provided, instead, there's a change in the conditions; the cloud ceases to cover the sun by the time the picnic starts, suggesting the sunshine is now visible. The phrase \\"it was out\\" refers back to the noun \\"sun\\" rather than the \\"cloud.\\" This is due to the principle of proximity, which states that pronouns generally refer to the closest preceding singular noun. In conclusion, interpreting \\"The sun was out\\" as \\"The cloud was out\\" would be incorrect. The original sentence conveys the idea that weather conditions improved by the time of the picnic, with the sun becoming visible rather than being obscured by clouds, making the setting presumably more suitable and enjoyable for a picnic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? ?  Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

With Josh McCown getting the start at quarterback, the Raiders began their 2007 campaign at home in an interconference fight with the Detroit Lions.  After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Lions continued with their early lead as Kitna completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  Afterwards, the Raiders began to come back as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry, followed by RB LaMont Jordan getting a 12-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Detroit responded with Hanson kicking a 46-yard field goal, while Oakland took the lead with McCown completing a 7-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith.  However, as it seems to be for the Raiders, their lead wouldn't hold as the Lions scored 17 unanswered points (32-yard TD pass from Kitna to WR Shaun McDonald, Hanson getting a 23-yard field goal, and RB Tatum Bell getting a 14-yard TD run) to end the game.

Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \\"I can see that something is troubling you.\\" he said.

Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The businessman saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \\"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\\" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business.

James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses, some impeachable, such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Rep. John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge (since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges, but was designed to benefit Covode's railroad company). However, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan, and as pointed in their condemnations, as the Republicans.  The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. (The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it.)  Buchanan claimed to have \\"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\\" with complete vindication.

The question is asking what an airplane does before it takes off. The options provided are: crash, accelerate, turn around, catch on fire, and carry freight. Step 2: Eliminate the options that are not related to the airplane's takeoff process. - Crash: Crashing is an unwanted accident and not something an airplane does deliberately before takeoff. - Catch on fire: Fire is also an accident and not a part of the normal takeoff process. Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options. - Turn around: While airplanes may sometimes need to turn around on the runway or taxiway, it is not the primary action that precedes takeoff. - Carry freight: Airplanes do indeed carry freight as part of their function, but it is unrelated to the specific takeoff process. Loading freight occurs well before the airplane is even on the runway. Step 4: Identify the most appropriate option. - Accelerate: Accelerating is the action in which an airplane increases its speed on the runway, which allows it to generate enough lift and become airborne. This is the most accurate description of what an airplane does right before takeoff.

I appreciate the invitation, Peter, but to be honest, football isn't really my thing. It kind of bores me. Peter: (Surprised) Really? I didn't know that, I always assumed you were into sports. What is it about football that you find boring? Joe: I don't know exactly. I guess it's just that football feels repetitive to me. Essentially, you're just running, kicking, and aiming to score, and then doing it all over again. The whole thing just doesn't capture my interest like some other activities do. Peter: I can understand where you're coming from, but have you considered that there's a lot of strategy and teamwork involved too? Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise and have fun with friends. Joe: Yeah, I do get the whole exercise and social aspect of it. And I'm sure there's more to the game than what meets the eye, but I just can't shake the feeling of boredom when I play. I'd much rather do something like hiking or try out a new activity, I think those push me out of my comfort zone more and keep me engaged. Peter: That makes sense. Hiking is great, and I can see how trying new activities would be more appealing to you. But you know, you could always give football another shot and see if your feelings have changed. Sometimes our interests evolve as we get older or even depending on who we play with. Joe: That's true, Peter, and I appreciate the open-mindedness. Maybe one day, when I'm in the mood for it, I'll give football another chance. It's just not something I'm looking to do today, you know? Peter: Fair enough, Joe. I won't push you to do something you're not interested in. We'll definitely get together for a hike or try something new soon, though! Joe: I'd love that! And who knows, if we do end up playing football in one of our outings, it might just surprise me and make me change my mind. Peter: Haha, you never know! Anyway, I've got to get going to the park now. Have a great day, Joe, and we'll catch up soon. Joe: You too, Peter! Have fun and tell the guys I said hi.

Usage: Premise: بنابر سرشماری مرکز آمار ایران، جمعیت بخش مرکزی شهرستان شهریار در سال ۱۳۸۵ برابر با ۵۱۴۷۴۰ نفر بوده‌است. Hypothesis: سرشماری در سال ۱۳۸۵افرایش ۵ درصدی جمعیت را نشان می دهد. Explanation: The premise provides information about the population of the central part of a district in Iran in 1385, while the hypothesis talks about a 5% increase in population in that year.  Part #2: Determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Usage: Classify the relationship as one of the following options: \\"Contradiction\\", \\"Neutral\\", or \\"Entailment\\". Explanation: We have to examine the information provided by the premise and the hypothesis and decide whether the hypothesis logically follows the premise (entailment), contradicts it (contradiction), or if it's unrelated (neutral). Part #3: Analyze the content of the sentences. Usage: The premise provides information about the population of the central part of a district in Iran in 1385 as 514,740. The hypothesis talks about a 5% population increase in that year. Explanation: In this case, both sentences are related to the population, but the hypothesis refers to a 5% increase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Part #4: Compare and classify the relationship. Usage: Classify the relationship as \\"Neutral\\". Explanation: Since there is no direct information in the premise to support or refute the 5% increase in population, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis cannot be considered as \\"Entailment\\" or \\"Contradiction,\\" so it should be classified as \\"Neutral\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although both questions concern the concept of gender, they are not paraphrases of each other.  The first question asks whether the world would be better without gender roles, which are societal expectations and norms associated with specific genders (e.g., women are expected to be caretakers, while men are expected to be breadwinners). Eliminating such roles would lead to a more equal society, where individuals would have more freedom to act independently of societal expectations based on their gender. The second question, on the other hand, asks about a world without genders, which refers to eliminating the concept of gender entirely, not just the roles associated with each gender. In this world, there would be no distinction between male, female or other gender identities. This question envisions a more radical change in society, where humans are not categorized into gender-based groups in any way.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Options: - eternal - religious - unpredictable - holy - monastic  Explain why a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"unpredictable\\" to answer the question above because the question's context is centered around the potential outcomes of a particular method of raising an AI. In this scenario, James is concerned about the results of giving an AI a non-secular upbringing, and \\"unpredictable\\" best captures his concerns. Here's a detailed explanation as to why a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" among the provided options: 1. Eternal: This option doesn't refer to the various possible outcomes, but rather to their duration. In this context, \\"eternal\\" would erroneously suggest that the AI's behavior would have unchanging implications, which isn't the primary concern of the question. Thus, a human might dismiss \\"eternal\\" as it doesn't address James's worry about potential outcomes. 2. Religious: While religion is related to the issue at hand – a secular vs. non-secular upbringing – this option doesn't directly address James's concern about the results of the alternative, which in this case is a non-secular upbringing. Instead, it describes a characteristic of that upbringing, making it an unsuitable answer for the question. 3. Unpredictable: In this context, \\"unpredictable\\" pertains to the range and variability of results that could stem from a non-secular upbringing for an AI. This option implies that if an AI is taught religious values, there might be unforeseen consequences due to the diverse nature of religious beliefs and interpretations. These consequences could be positive or negative, but the uncertainty is what drives James's preference for a secular upbringing. As a result, a human might choose \\"unpredictable\\" as the most accurate answer to the question. 4. Holy: Similar to \\"religious,\\" this option mainly describes a characteristic of a non-secular upbringing rather than addressing the concern of potential outcomes. \\"Holy\\" simply denotes a religious or sacred aspect, but doesn't capture the essence of unpredictability that James worries about. 5. Monastic: This option, again, doesn't tackle the core issue of the question. \\"Monastic\\" is related to the lifestyle of monks and religious practices, but the term itself does not convey James's concern about unpredictable results stemming from a non-secular upbringing for the AI. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" as the answer to the question presented because it best encapsulates the primary concern: uncertainty about the range and variability of outcomes resulting from a non-secular upbringing for an AI. The other options, while related to religious themes, do not directly address the nature of James's worries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize the following: Bankruptcy is the process of eliminating some or all of your debts in exchange for either regular payments or a seizing of your property. Although it may not seem like an enviable option, it's the smartest way out of an underwater mortgage for many homeowners. When you file for bankruptcy, the foreclosure proceedings can be stopped with an automatic stay. In order to qualify for bankruptcy, you have to complete a means test, pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, as well as acquire the correct paperwork such as tax documents. There are essentially 2 different kinds of bankruptcy declarations, each with their own unique rules and specifications. As they relate to stopping a foreclosure, they are briefly described below:  In chapter 7 bankruptcy, you ask to have most, if not all, of your debts discharged by the courts. In exchange for this discharge, the courts can take any property not exempt from collection, sell it, and distribute the proceeds to your creditors. With chapter 7, you won't be able to keep your house, but you will be able to stall the foreclosure for at least a couple of months. For chapter 7 bankruptcy, you will be able to keep your home if it is the only property you own and if you currently reside there. Though the debt will be discharged, you must continue to make payments on the home in order to keep it. If you do not make the payments, the lender can foreclose on the property. In some states, you will be able to discharge the debt and move out without any recourse, but in other states the lender may be able to come after you for the debt. In chapter 13 bankruptcy, you agree to a plan to pay back all or most of your debts over a certain period of time. The time you have to repay the debt, as well as the repayment plan itself, depends on how much you earn, as well as the types of debt you currently own. With chapter 13, you should be able to keep your home, especially if you think you'll be able to make payments in the future. The repayment plan usually lasts three to five years. S. Bankruptcy Court. Meet with a lawyer and declare your bankruptcy. Start making payments. After a while, attend a meeting of the creditors. This is a meeting between you and a bankruptcy trustee. However, your creditors may also attend. This meeting will give you a better sense of where foreclosure proceedings are at. Bankruptcy attorneys usually collect their fees before a bankruptcy begins because they don't want you to go bankrupt as a result of their fees. The fees could cost 1500 to 3000 or more depending on how complicated your situation is. Find an attorney who charges a flat fee and who has experience with bankruptcies.","output":"Bankruptcy is a legal process designed to help individuals or businesses eliminate some or all of their debts, often as a last resort to manage their financial situation. Filing for bankruptcy can potentially halt foreclosure proceedings on a property through an automatic stay provision. This process involves completing a means test, attending pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, and providing necessary paperwork such as tax documents. There are two primary types of bankruptcy declarations relevant to foreclosure: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor seeks to have most, if not all, of their debts discharged by the court. As a result, the court may seize and sell non-exempt property to distribute the proceeds among creditors. Filing for Chapter 7 can delay foreclosure for a few months, but the debtor typically cannot keep their house unless it is their only property and they continue making payments. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves creating a repayment plan where the debtor agrees to pay back all or most of their debts over a specified period (usually three to five years). The repayment amount and plan depend on the individual's income and the types of debt they have. With Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debtors are more likely to keep their home as long as they can continue making payments as stipulated in their repayment plan. To declare bankruptcy and stop a foreclosure, it's essential to consult a lawyer experienced in bankruptcies. They can assist with filling out and filing the proper paperwork, working out a feasible repayment plan, and representing the debtor during a meeting of creditors, which involves a bankruptcy trustee and possibly the debtor's creditors. Fees for bankruptcy attorneys typically range from 1,500 to 3,000 or more but vary depending on the complexity of the case. It's crucial to find a lawyer who charges a flat fee to avoid surprise costs or complications during the bankruptcy process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As the Spice Girls prepare to reunite briefly next week for the premiere of their new musical Viva Forever! and a major new TV show, there’s a growing prospect this might not be the final chapter for the world’s most successful girl group. The pressure to get back together is being driven by Melanie Brown — Scary Spice — who has been in Australia judging a version of The X Factor there. In her first interview about the stage production and highly anticipated ITV Christmas special, she reveals: ‘I keep saying to the girls, “Let’s reunite and tour again!” I’m up for it and I’m always championing it.’ Getting back together? The Spice Girls - from left to right, Mel B, Mel C, Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton and Victoria Beckham - could be considering a longer-term reunion. While Victoria Beckham was believed to have ruled out performing with her bandmates — Mel B, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell —again, their well-received outing at the closing ceremony of London 2012 may have changed that. ‘We didn’t get paid for the Olympics — we funded it ourselves, costumes and everything. It just goes to show how much we do get on and do like each other. But it’s easier said than done with our schedules,’ Mel adds. 'We're like sisters': Melanie Brown is said to be pushing for the group to get back together. ‘We’re like sisters. We can bicker and make comments to each other. We go through highs and lows together. We go through fallouts and make-ups and break-ups. That’s just the way we are.‘We’re five very passionate, creative girls. But we love each other and we’re like family. Well, the family you want to have.’ Mel could be referring to her high profile rift with her mum Andrea, who, I revealed, will not feature in the ITV documentary. ‘Not all the Spice Mums did the documentary,’ Mel says. ‘All I said during filming was that I adore my family. All of us love our mothers.’ ITV’s cameras followed Mel for a ‘few days’ and she found it emotional looking back at the band’s career. ‘It was really nice to be able to reflect,’ she says. ‘It makes you feel humble and appreciative of where you come from. I owe everything to the Spice Girls. I wouldn’t be able to live or travel like I do if it wasn’t for those four other girls.’ The world premiere of Viva Forever! on Tuesday at London’s Piccadilly Theatre will see the Spice Girls attend with their partners, including David Beckham. Victoria’s husband’s attendance has excited ITV producers because it means he will now feature in the Spice TV show. A star audience: David Beckham, left, will be joining his wife Victoria Beckham, right, at the premiere of Viva Forever!

But he has assured his wife, who will become Posh Spice again for the. evening, that he will be by her side. ‘Victoria’s. nervous about entering Spice World again, but she’s very proud of the. musical, so it’s important for her to have David there,’ my source. explains. For weeks, viewers have asked why Strictly Come Dancing’s judges have given Olympic gymnast Louis Smith tougher scores and critiques than his rivals. It was only after his near-flawless performance on Saturday that Len Goodman, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell began to award him marks comparable to front-runner Denise Van Outen. I’m told that’s because staff on the show are well aware the heart-throb has been topping the viewers’ phone vote for weeks and is almost assured a place in the final on December 22. Tough critics: Olympic gymnast Louis Smith pictured with dancer Flavia Cacace on Strictly Come Dancing. My Strictly source reveals: ‘It’s been known behind the scenes for weeks now that Louis is a sure bet for the final. As a result, the judges knew there was no point giving him nines and tens every week because it would allow him no progression throughout the series. ‘To be truthful, they have marked him harder than the other dancers because he is a gymnast who has a natural advantage over a rival like Lisa Riley.’ While I don’t want to see the judges going easy on the celebs, it’s been clear to me they’ve been marking Louis, 23, down unfairly for weeks. If anything, that has only increased his support with the public. Barring a huge surprise over the next two weeks, it’s hard to see a scenario where he won’t become this year’s king of the dancefloor. ITV will premiere The McFly Show tomorrow night — a 1970s-style variety programme fronted by the popular boyband. If it’s a success, the one-off edition could be developed into a weekly series, featuring comedy sketches and performances. ‘It’s something we’ve been working on for a long time and we hope it could become something more regular,’ drummer and last year’s Strictly winner Harry Judd tells me.
