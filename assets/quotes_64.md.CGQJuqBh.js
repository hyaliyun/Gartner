Back when I was working at Neiman-Marcus from 2006 to 2007- I ended up getting to know this guy who worked as a supervisor for another department. That happened while I was driving home from my job one day (after I had been an employee for that company a little more than two months)- and I accidentally hit the back of his pick-up truck while he was stopped at a red light. So after we both pulled over into the parking lot right next to us- he had me see the damage I put on his back bumper and then said that we needed the police to come out. I could definitely understand that- since this was an auto accident that involved two vehicles. The front of my car was badly smashed up- and I was lucky to later find out my insurance could just pay to have all that damage repaired. When a police car did come pulling up- two policemen got out of it and came walking over to us. Then they decided to ask him about what happened- since he was an older person and I looked really young at the time. He had them find out that he was stopped like he was supposed to be- and then I suddenly showed up ramming right into him. So that had them ask me what my reason for doing that was- and I actually told them ‘the truth’ that I apparently was going a little faster than I should have been. The cops then said that I will be written up in their report as ‘the one’ responsible for the traffic violation- and that had them give me a ticket saying I owed up to 300 to the police department. I later learned that I could have it reduced down to 100- if I was okay with having to take a session of defensive driving one Saturday (and I most certainly did when I could have that scheduled). The policemen had each talked with one of us- as one was getting his personal information and the other one was doing the same with me. The cop who was talking to me asked where I was currently employed- and I told him that I had been working at Neiman-Marcus starting that year in June. When both of the cops were done doing what they had to do- that was when the man came over to me and asked if he overheard me say I was working at where I did. After I told him ‘yes’- he then said that was where he worked and told me he did what I have already mentioned. Now to get to the actual point of this story- which had happened several months later after it was already the next year. I had later set up an account on MySpace- and was requesting people I had known during my life. Since I had already gotten a few that I was working with there at Neiman-Marcus- I looked him up on that website and sent him ‘a request’. He then sent me a PM saying that he had looked at my profile- and was going to turn down my request because he did NOT take other employees as a general rule. I told him about us having the auto accident together months earlier- and just thought that I could get to know him better on that website. He explained himself by saying that since he was a supervisor at that place- he just thought it would NOT be a good idea to get personally involved with anyone he did NOT have anything to do with outside of there. Since I was a very young person at the time- I made the mistake of sending him multiple PMs thinking I was just making conversation with somebody else. He started off just NOT replying to whatever I had sent- and then eventually did what he thought was necessary. One day I was in my department just getting my work done- and then one of my own supervisors comes approaching me. She says that the woman who is the manager in the Human Resources department needs to see me- and I go walking over into her office wondering what that is about. When I come inside- that woman is sitting at her desk looking ready to chew somebody out. So she asks me if I go on a website called MySpace- and I replied to her by saying ‘yes’. After I answered the question- she wants to know if I was the one who had been repeatedly sending PMs to that man. Then I once again tell her ‘yes’- and it was right then that she told me to take a seat. That is when she tells me about how he had come into her office earlier- and said that he wanted me to immediately stop making contact with him on the website. So she talks about how him NOT accepting the request I sent him meant something in particular- that I was NOT to be talking to him “at all”. Since I had failed to show that I understood that- he decided it was time that I get reported and am informed by someone in upper management about my wrongdoing. I was made to understand that since he was a supervisor there- he did NOT want any employees talking to him unless they were his friends that he spent personal time with. He was in charge of a different department- and there were times that he himself had to personally discuss business with the supervisors over my department. So since I was talking to him on MySpace- that had him worried that I somehow was going to cause “major conflicts” with what he had to do there at that job. I NEVER could figure out how that would be possible- but that woman did tell me I had to stop sending him PMs or else he was to let her know (and I would find myself back in her office). That made me so upset- I felt like I wanted to tell that guy right off for reporting me. I had been doing what I did when I was ‘at home and on my own time’- NOT when I was at the job and currently under the management for the company. All he had to do was let me know himself that I was NOT to do that anymore- and then just have given me his own warning telling me that I would be blocked if I sent him another PM. So I just thought there was NOTHING I could do about it as long as I was employed there- but I did later send him something on MySpace on the day that I left that place for good saying I was extremely mad at him for getting me fussed at. He did NOT reply back to me after that- and did actually block me that time so I could NOT talk to him again."},{"instruction":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?","output":"The speed of attaining the goal."},{"instruction":"What champion is the best for the Apex Legends solo mode?","output":"Good question, It is easiest to start with which Legends are not good to play as in the new Solo Mode. Legends NOT to use in Solos Lifeline: A great Legend if you have a squad to play with, but not so much in solos where her Passive is useless and her ultimate dangerous to use (it’s like sending up a flare). Wattson: Better than Lifeline, but still not as effective in solos as in regular Apex. Legends to Use Stick with Characters whose abilities do not rely on having other teammates. Octane, for example, is a very good Legend to play as in solos mode as all of his abilities center around his own maneuverability. Pathfinder is good as well, as is Bloodhound, Mirage, Wraith, and Bangalore. Even Gibraltor plays decent in solos with his 15% damage reduction perk and gun shield (not to mention his excellent ultimate and tactical). Caustic can be very good as well. To be honest, you can play well in solos with practically any Legend, the real difficulty is adapting your own playstyle to fit with the change in pace of the game. But if I had to pick one Legend I think is the best in Solos? I’d choose Octane. Why Octane is the Best He’s very fast. In a game mode where you will often have to juggle fighting multiple players, Octane’s high speed and small hitbox are beyond useful. His jump pad ultimate is great for reaching higher areas or outmaneuvering other players. Not to mention, his passive (Recharge health slowly) is one of the better ones. Disclaimer bit But, as I’ve said before, being good at the new solos mode in Apex Legends is (In my opinion) more about adjusting your play style than it is about choosing the right Legend. Almost all of the Legends perform really well in Solos and only a few suffer from the change in pace. Thanks for the fun question, Hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"have £5,000.

के दस नाटक प्राप्त हुए। खोज करने पर तीन और नाटक मिले। 1912 ई 0 में गणपति शास्त्री द्वारा अनंतशयन संस्कृत ग्रंथावली में भास के नाम से वे प्रकाशित किए गए। इन नाटकों की कई प्रतियाँ अन्य स्थानों से प्राप्त हुई हैं। उक्त 13 नाटकों को पूर्णत: या अंशत: भासकृत मानने / न मानने वालों के पक्ष तर्कसमर्पित होकर भी आजतक निर्णायक नहीं हो सके। इस विवाद के उठने के अनेक कारण हैं। नाटकों की स्थापना (प्रस्तावना) और पुष्पिका में कहीं भी नाटककार भास का नाम नहीं मिलता। संस्कृत ग्रंथों में भास के जो अंश उदधृत हैं उनमें अधिकांश अक्षरश: इन नाटकों में अनुपलब्ध हैं। इसी प्रकार अनेक कारण है जो उन तेरह नाटकों की भासरचना विषयक प्रामाणिकता को संदिग्ध बनाते हैं। इस प्रसंग के प्रमुख मतपक्षों को चार वर्गो में रखा जा सकता है (क) कुछ विद्वान् इन नाटकों को भासकृत मानते हैं - जैसे डॉ॰ कीथ, पुसलकर, अय्यर आदि;(ख) कुछ लोग प्रचलित नाटकों को केरल के चाक्यार नटों की कृति मानते हैं या परवर्ती किसी सामान्य नाटककार की रचना समझते हैं;(ग) दूसरे पंडितों का कथन है कि \\"प्रतिज्ञायौगंधरायणम्\\" \\"स्वप्नवासवदत्तम्\\" आदि नाटक भासकृत हैं क्योकि प्राचीन संस्कृत ग्रंथों में उनका संकेत है तथा अन्य भासकृत नहीं है;(घ) अन्य कुछ विद्वानों के मत से मूलत: वे नाटक भासकृत थे; पर उनका वर्त्तमान रूप नटों या अन्य द्वारा नाट्यप्रयोगानुकूल परिवर्तित या संक्षिप्त होकर सामने आया है। यह भी कभी कभी कहा जाता है कि भास के उपलब्ध नाटक अधूरे थे जिसे अन्य या अन्यजनों ने पूरा करके उन्हें वर्तमान रूप दिया। जो हो, यह निश्चित है क ये नाटक जाली नहीं हैं। केरल के चाकार परंपरा ने समान रूप से सुरक्षित रखा है। परंपरागत प्रसिद्धि के अनुसार उनकी संख्या 23 या 30 कही गई है। त्रिवेंद्रम् संस्करण के 13 नाटकों में कुछ ऐसी समानताएँ और विशेषताएँ हैं जिनके कारण वर्तमान संस्करण की नाट्यलेखन और नाट्यशिल्प के कलाकार की एकता सूचित होती है। \\"नांद्यंते तत: प्रविशति सूत्रधार:\\" से इनका आरंभ, प्रस्तावना के स्थान पर स्थापना शब्द का प्रयोग, नाटककार के नाम का अभाव, भरतवाक्य में प्राय: साम्य, भरत के नाट्यशास्त्रीय कुछ विधानों का अपालन, संस्कृत में कतिपय अपाणिनीय रूप का प्रयोग, अनेक नाटकों में कुछ पात्रों के नाम का साम्य, विचार और आदर्श की समानता, प्राकृत भाषा की कुछ विलक्षणता आदि ऐसी बातें हैं जिनके कारण इन सब के एककर्तृत्व का संकेत भी मिलता है। पर वह भास थे या चाक्यार नटों के नाट्यरूपंतकार, यह नहीं कहा जा सकता।

रखा गया है। प्रतिमा निर्माण की कथा भास की अपनी मौलिकता है। भास ने इस नाटक में मौलिकता लाने में प्रचलित रामचरित से पर्याप्त पार्थक्य ला दिया है। यद्यपि ये सारी घटनायें प्रचलित कथा से भिन्न हैं , पर नाटकीय दृष्टि से इनका महत्व सुतरां ऊँचा है और पाठक अथवा दर्शक की कौतुहल वृद्धि में ये घटनायें सहायक हुई हैं। इस नाटक में [LINKED_TEXT: रामायणीय] [URL:

ही राज्याभिषेक इस नाटक में मौलिक ही है। प्रतिमा नाटक भास के सर्वोत्तम नाटकों में से एक है। सात अंकों के इस नाटक में भास की कला पर्याप्त ऊँचाईं को प्राप्त कर चुकी है। इस नाटक में भास ने पात्रों का चारित्रिक उत्कर्ष दिखाने का भरसक प्रयास किया है। इतिवृत्त तथा चरित्रचित्रण दोनों दृष्टियों से यह नाटक सफल हुआ है। भावों के अनुकूल भाषा तथा लघु विस्तारी वाक्य भास के नाटकों की अपनी विशेषताएँ हैं। यह

करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=5] यह भी रामकथा पर आश्रित है। इसमें छः अंक हैं। इसमें रामायण के किष्किंधाकाण्ड से युद्धकाण्ड की समाप्ति तक की कथा अर्थात् बालिवध से राम राज्याभिषेक तक की कथा वर्णित है। रामराज्याभिषेक के आधार पर ही इसका नामकरण किया गया है। कथानक को सजान संवारने में नाटककार ने पर्याप्त मौलिकता का परिचय दिया है। बालिवध को न्या ̧य रूप देने का भी नाटककार ने पर्याप्त प्रयास किया है। इस नाटक के नायक मर्यादापुरूषोत्तम श्री रामचन्द्र हैं। लोकोपदेश उनके चरित्र का प्रधान भाग है। लक्ष्मण का चरित्र इस नाटक में विशेष प्रस्फुटित नहीं हो सका है। वे श्रीराम क एक आज्ञाकारी सेवक तथा विनीत भक्त के रूप में सामने आते हैं। सुग्रीव का चरित्र इस नाटक में प्रारंभ से लेकर अन्त तक किसी न किसी रूप में वर्तमान रहता है। विभीषण न्यायप्रिय भगवद् भक्त के रूप में अंकित किया गया है। रावण क्रूर, दुराचारी तथा परस्त्री लम्पट के रूप में चित्रित किया गया है। अभिषेक नाटक के प्रणयन में भास ने पर्याप्त सफलता प्राप्त की है। यद्यपि काव्य तथा नाटकीयता की दृष्टि से यह नाटक प्रतिमा नाटक की अपेक्षा अवर कोटि का है तथापि इस नाटक की अपनी विशेषतायें हैं। राम-रावण युद्ध अपनी विशिष्टताओं में बेजोड़ है। पात्रों का कथोपकथन आकर्षक है। छोट - छोटे तथा सरल वाक्यों का विन्यास भास की अपनी विशेषता है तथा उस विशेषता का दर्शन इस नाटक में होता है। इस नाटक का प्रधान रस वीर है जो समग्र नाटक में व्याप्त है, पर करूण रस भी यत्र तत्र अनुस्यूत है। इसकी सत्ता बालिवध के अनन्तर, सीता के सन्ताप आदि में देखी जा सकती हैं। श्रृंगार का इसमें अभाव है तथा उसके लिए कहीं अवसर भी नहीं आया है। मध्यम व्यायोग[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=6] यह एक अंक का व्यायोग है। व्यायोग रुपक का एक भेद होता है। इसकी कथावस्तु का आधार महाभारत है। इसमें पाण्डवों के वनवास काल में भीम द्वारा घटोत्कच के पंजे से एक ब्राह्मण बालक की मुक्ति की कथा है। मध्यम शब्द मध्यम पाण्डव भीम और ब्राह्मण के मध्यम पुत्र दोनों के लिए प्रयुक्त हुआ है। इसलिए इस नाटक का नाम ‘‘मध्यम व्यायोग’’ है। नाटकीय दृष्टि से यह नाटक उत्तम कोटि का है, क्यों की इस परिपाक तथा भावोन्मेष में नाटककार को पूरी सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। कथोपकथनों में कहीं वैरस्य नहीं आता तथा दर्शक का कुतुहल प्रतिक्षण बढ़ता हुआ दिखाई देता है। इन कथोपकथनों में भाषा भी बड़ी सहायक सिद्ध हुई है। लम्बे समासान्त पदों का यहाँ अभाव है। भाषा सरलता में बेजोड़ है। घटनाक्रम में सत्वरता प्रभावोत्पादन में चार-चाँद लगा देती है। भास का काव्य कर्म भी इस रुपक में सफल रहा है। कर्णभार[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=7] यह भी एक अंक के कथानक वाला महाभारत की कथावस्तु से सम्बद्ध व्यायोग है। द्रोणाचार्य के परलोक सिधारे जाने पर कर्ण को सेनापति बनाया जाता है तथा युद्ध का भार उस पर आ पड़ता है, इसलिए नाटक का नाम ‘‘कर्णभार’’ है। ‘‘कर्णभार’’ शीर्षक की व्याख्या विद्वानों ने अनेक प्रकार से की है। प्रोफेसर ए डी पुसालकर की सम्मति में कानों के भारभूत कुण्डलों का दानकर यहाँ कर्ण की अद्भुत दानशीलता वर्णित की गई है। अतः कानों के आधारभूत कुण्डलों के दान को केन्द्र मानकर इस नाटक की रचना करन से इस नाटक का नाम ‘‘कर्णभार’’ है। डॉ विन्टरनित्स ने कर्णभार की व्याख्या कर्ण के कठिन कार्य से की है। डॉ॰ भट्ट की धारणा है कि कर्ण की चिन्ता ही भारस्वरूप हो गई है। इसी बात को ध्यान में रखकर इस नाटक का नाम कर्णभार रखा गया है। कुछ लोगों के मत में कर्ण द्वारा प्राप्त युद्ध कौशल उनके लिए भारभूत हो गया था, अतः इस नाटक का नाम कर्णभार पड़ा। इस नाटक में दो पात्रों का चरित्र मुख्य रूप से चित्रित है। एक है इस नाटक के नायक कर्ण और दूसरे हैं , छः ब्राह्मण वेषधारी देवराज इन्द्र। कर्ण के चरित्र की सबसे बड़ी विशेषता जो यहाँ उभर कर सामने आयी है, वह है उसकी अपूर्व ब्राह्मण निष्ठा तथा महती दानशीलता। वह ब्राह्मणों के लिए सर्वस्व दान करने के लिए तत्पर दिखाई पड़ता है। जब इन्द्र गौ, सुवर्ण आदि लेना अस्वीकार करते हैं , तब वह अपना सिर देने की बात कहता है। उसका विश्वास है कि मरने पर भी यश ही स्थिर रहता है - ’’हतेषु देहेषु गुणा धरन्ते’’। कर्ण के चरित्र की दूसरी बड़ी विशेषता है कि वह दान से किसी प्रतिफल की आशा नहीं रखता। इन्द्र के चरित्र में स्वार्थी रूप के अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई विशेषता लक्षित नहीं होती। शल्य का चरित्र कोई विशेष उभरकर सामने नहीं आया है। अपने लघु विस्तार में यह नाटक पूर्ण है। काव्यरस के परिपाक तथा नाटकीय तत्वों क निर्वाह दोनों दृष्टियों से यह नाटक उच्च कोटि का है। यद्यपि नाटक का विषय वीर रस और युद्ध भूमि से ही सम्बन्ध रखता है, पर नाटक में करुण रस की ही विशष प्रभा दिखाई पड़ती है। पंचरात्र[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=8] यह तीन अंकों का ‘‘समवकार’’ हे। इसकी कथा महाभारत के विराट पर्व पर आधारित है। इसका नामकरण स्पष्ट रूप से पॉच रात्रियों में पाण्डवों को ढूँढनें की बात से हुआ है। द्रोणाचार्य के सत्प्र यास से पाण्डव मिल जाते हैं तथा दुर्योधन द्वारा उन्हे आधा राज्य दे दिया जाता है। इस नाटक में सबसे प्रधान चरित्र दुर्योधन का चित्रित है। आरंभ से अन्त तक वह नाटक में वर्तमान है। नाटक में सर्वप्रथम एक धार्मिक राजा के रूप में उसका चरित्र सामने आया है। पाण्डवों को राज्य भ्रष्ट कर वह महान् यज्ञ का प्रवर्तन करता है। यज्ञ में सभी देश देशान्तर क राजा उसको कर देने उपस्थित होते हैं। यह उनके महान् शौर्यं पराक्रम को घोषित करता है। अवभृथ स्नान के समय दुर्योधन की अटूट गुरूभक्ति भी सामने आती है। काव्योत्कर्ष की दृष्टि से यह रुपक उत्तम कोटि का कहा जायेगा। सरल शब्दावली में भावोन्मेष भास की अपनी विशेषता है। शब्दों के आश्रय से भास ऐसा चित्र खड़ा कर देते हैं कि पूरा दृष्य ही सामने आ जाता है। अलंकारों की संघटना भी नितान्त आकर्षक है। स्थान-स्थान पर सूक्तियाँ इस बारीकी के साथ दी गई हैं कि प्रभावोत्पादन में वे दूनी वृद्धि कर देती हैं। इस रूपक का प्रधान रस वीर है। श्रृगांर का इसमें पूर्णरूपेण अभाव है, जो नाटक में स्त्रीपात्रों के न आने से हुआ है। संक्षेप में इसे भासे की नाट्यचातुरी का अनुपम उदाहरण कहा जा सकता है। उरुभंग[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=9] यह भी महाभारत की कथा पर आश्रित एक एकांकी है, इसमें व्यायोग के लक्षण घटित होते हैं। द्रा पे दी के अपमान का प्रतिशोध लेने हेतु भीम व दुर्योधन का गदायुद्ध इसमें वर्णित हुआ है। इसमें एक ही अंक है तथा समय व स्थान की अन्विति का पूर्ण रूप से पालन किया गया है। नाटक की विशिष्टता इसके दुःखान्त होने के कारण है। इस रुपक का नायक दुर्योधन है। उसके चरित्र विन्यास में नाटककार ने पर्याप्त कौशल प्रदर्शित किया है। इस एंकाकी में नाटककार ने उसके चरित्र को नितान्त उदात्त तथा प्रांजल रूप में प्रदर्शित किया है। वह शौर्य पराक्रम का जीवन्त प्रतीक है। दुर्योधन के अतिरिक्त अश्वत्थामा तथा बलराम का व्यक्तित्व भी अपने में महत्वपूर्ण है। संस्कृत नाट्य-साहित्य में उरुभंग अपना विशिष्ट स्थान रखता है। नाटकीय कौशल की दृष्टि से यह नाटकप्रशंसनीय है। कथोपकथनों में स्वाभाविकता सर्वत्र परिलक्षित होती है। समय और पात्र के अनुकूल ही वार्तालापों की संघटना की गई है। दुर्योधन के उरुभंग हो जाने पर बलराम जी की चेश्टाओं तथा कथनों में पर्याप्त स्वाभाविकता है। रस की दृष्टि से भी नाटककार को पर्याप्त सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। नाटक में करुण तथा वीर रस परस्पर अनुस्यूत हैं। इन दोनों रसों के चित्रण में लेखक को पर्याप्त सफलता मिली है। बाल चरित[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=10] इसमें पाँच अंक हैं , यह नाटक भगवान् श्री कृष्ण की बाल लीलाओं पर आधारित है। पुराणों मे य ह प्रस ग बहुचर्चित है। विशेषतः श्रीमद्भागत महापुराण का तो यही सार है। इसमें श्रीकृष्ण के जन्म से कंस वध तक की कथा वर्णित है। इसमें बाल रुपधारी भगवान् श्री कृष्ण की लीलायें व चरित्र प्रदर्शित है। अतः इस नाटक का नाम बालचरित रखा गया है। इस नाटक में नायक के रूप में भगवान् श्री कृष्ण का चरित्र वर्णित है। नाटककार इन्हें साक्षात् परात्पर ब्रह्म के रूप में चित्रित करता है। पृथ्वी के भार को दूर करने तथा गो-ब्राह्मण की रक्षा एवं असुरों के संहार के लिये उन्होंने नर रूप धारण किया है। इसमें कृष्ण का अलौकिक एवं मानवीय दोनों रूप स्पष्टतः देखेन को मिलते हैं। कृष्ण के अलावा बलराम, वसुदवे जी एवं कंस का चरित्र भी इस नाटक में चित्रित किया गया है। वासुदवे जी का चरित्र शालीनता से ओतप्रा ते है। कंस का चरित्र अत्यधिक कठोर प्रदर्शित किया गया है। नाटकीय दृष्टि से इसे एक सफल नाटक कहा जा सकता है। इसका नायक प्रख्यात तथा धीरोदात्त है। वह नायक के सभी गुणों से सम्पन्न है। इस की दृष्टि से इसमें वीर रस प्रधान है तथा करूण, रौद्र आदि रस अंग रूप में आये हैं। भाषा कथोपकथनों के अनुरूप है। सरल भाषा दर्शक के हृदय पर अपना अपूर्व प्रभाव डालती है। काव्य परिपाक की दृष्टि से यह नाटक अत्यन्तप्रशंसनीय है। अलंकारों का सुन्दर व समुचित प्रयोग किया गया है। बालचरित का निम्न श्लोक अनेक अलंकार ग्रन्थों में उल्लिखित हुआ है - लिम्पतीव तमोऽगांनि वर्षतीवान्जनं नभः। असत्पुरूष सेव वे दृष्टिर्निष्फलतां गता॥ (1/15) रात्रि के वर्णन में नाटककार को विशेष सफलता प्राप्त हुई है। शब्दों के द्वारा भावदशा के चित्रण में भास ने महान् सफलता प्राप्त की है। शब्दों के आश्रय से सम्पूर्ण भावदशा सारी परिस्थितियाँ साक्षात् दृष्टिगत होने लगती हैं। दूतवाक्य[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=11] यह भी एकांकी नाटक है। रुपक के भेदानुसार यह ‘‘व्यायोग’’ है। इसमें श्रीकृष्ण का दूत के रूप में वर्णन हुआ है। श्रीकृष्ण दुर्योधन के पास संधि का प्रस्ताव लेकर आते हैं किन्तु उनका वहाँ अपमान किया जाता है तथा वे असफल होकर लौटते हैं। वे कुद्ध होकर सुदर्शन चक्र का आह्वान करते हैं तथा उसे दुर्योधन का वध करने का आदेश देते हैं। परन्तु वह वैसा करन से रोकता है। इसकी कथावस्तु महाभारत से ली गई है। इसका नामकरण बहुत ही सटीक है। सम्पूर्ण नाटक दूतवेशधारी श्रीकृष्ण के वचनों स अनुप्रमाणित है। अतः ‘‘दूतवाक्य’’ नाम पूर्णतया सार्थक है। सम्पूर्ण नाटक वीररस से ओतप्रा ते है। श्रीकृष्ण के अस्त्रों की सहसा उद्भावना तथा विराट रूप प्रदर्शन में अद्भुत रस का चमत्कार है। प्रधान रूप से आरभटी वृत्ति की योजना है। राजनीतिक सिद्धान्तों की यह नाटक खान है। ‘‘द़ायाद्य’’ को लेकर दुर्योधन एवं श्रीकृष्ण के मध्य हुआ वार्तालाप अत्यन्त रोचक एवं सटीक है। राज्यशासन के संदर्भ में दुर्योधन का कथन अत्यन्त सारगर्भित एवं महत्वपूर्ण है। वह कहता है कि ‘‘राज्य शासन असक्तों का काम नहीं वह तो महान् बलशालियों से सिद्ध होता है - राज्यं नाम नृपात्मजैः सहृदयैर्जित्वा रिपून् भुज्यते। तल्लोके न तु याच्यते न तु पुनर्दीनाय वा दीयते॥ भास की भाषा सरल, पात्रानुकूल व रसानुरूप है। दूत घटोत्कच[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=12] यह एकांकी भी महाभारत की कथा पर आधारित है। इसमें अभिमन्यु की मृत्यु के पश्चात् श्रीकृष्ण घटोत्कच को दूत रूप में धृतराष्टं के पास भेजते हैं। दुर्योधन क्रुद्ध होकर घटोत्कच का तिरस्कार करता है। दोनों में परस्पर वाद विवाद होता है। घटोत्कच दुर्योधन को युद्ध के लिये ललकारता है। धृतराष्टं उसे शान्त करते हैं। अन्त में घटोत्कच अर्जुन द्वारा अभिमन्यु का बदला लेने की बात कहकर धमकी देते हुये निकल जाता है। घटोत्कच के दूत बनकर जाने के कारण ही इसका नाम ‘‘दूत घटोत्कच’’ रखा गया है। इस नाटक का प्रधान पात्र घटोत्कच है। वह वीर रस से ओतप्रा ते है। वीरता क साथ-साथ उसमें शालीनता तथा शिष्टता भी समभावेन दृष्टिगत होती है। वह वाक्पटु भी है। संक्षेप में हम यह कह सकते हैं कि नाटककार ने घटोत्कच का चरित्र बहुत ही उन्नत रूप में प्रस्तुत किया है। घटोत्कच के अलावा दुर्योधन, शकुनि तथा दुःशासन के चरित्र भी इस नाटक में उभरकर समाने आये हैं। ये सभी अत्यन्त अभिमानी तथा क्रूर प्रकृति के हैं। निहत्थे बालक अभिमन्यु का मारकर वे प्रसन्न होते हैं। नाटक वीर तथा करुण रस का सम्मिलन है। एक और अभिमन्यु की मृत्यु से करुण रस का वातावरण प्रस्तुत है तो दूसरी और घटोत्कच तथा दुर्योधनादि के विवाद में वीररस अपना अस्तित्व व्यक्त करता है। यह नाटक वास्तविकता के निकट प्रतीत होता है मानव हृदय की आकांक्षाओं एवं कमजोरियों के चित्रण में नाटककार अत्यन्त सफल है। इस नाटक में भरतवाक्य का अभाव है, अतः कुछ लोग इसे अपूर्ण बतलाते हैं , संभव है आगे इसमें कुछ अंश रहा हो। परन्तु यह नाटक अपने प्रयोजन में पूर्ण है। प्रतिज्ञायौगन्धरायण[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=13] यह लोककथाश्रित नाटक है। इसमें कौशाम्बी के राजा वत्सराज उदयन द्वारा उज्जयिनी के राजा प्रद्योत की पुत्री वासवदत्ता rajkumari के हरण की कथा है। इसमें चार अंक हैं। इस नाटक का नामकरण अमात्य यौगन्धरायण की प्रतिज्ञाओं पर आश्रित है। इस नाटक में अमात्य यौगन्धरायण अपने स्वामी को शत्रु के बन्दीगृह से छुड़ा लाने की प्रतिज्ञा करता है तथा अनेक विध्नों के उपस्थित होने पर भी उसे पूर्ण कर बताता है। इस नाटक का नायक वत्स देश का राजा उदयन कलाकारों का सिरमौर है। वह भरतवंशी राजा है। वह अत्यन्त रूपवान है तथा उसके रूप पर महासेन प्रद्योत की स्त्री भी मुग्ध है। वीणावादन में वह आचार्य है। उसके वीणावादन की प्रसिद्धि देश देशान्तर में व्याप्त है तथा बन्दी अवस्था में ही उसे प्रद्योतपुत्री वासवदत्ता को वीणा सिखाने का दायित्व मिलता है। अतुलित कला प्र मे होने के साथ-साथ वह शौर्य तथा पराक्रम से भी ओतप्रा ते है। कृत्रिम गज को पकड़ने का प्रयास करते समय जब प्रद्योत की सेना उस पर टूट पड़ती है, वह किंचित् मात्र भी विचलित नहीं होता तथा अनेकों को मृत्यु के घाट भेज देता है। यहाँ उसके धैर्य तथा पराक्रम की परीक्षा होती है जिसमें वह सफल होता है। जब उसे बन्दी बना लिया जाता है तो वह अपने आपको मन से बन्दी नहीं मानता तथा यौगन्धरायण द्वारा मुक्ति का पूरा प्रबन्ध कर लेने पर भी वासवदत्ता को लेकर चलने का निश्चय करता है। इस काम में वह अपने कौशल तथा यौगन्धरायण के बुद्धि कौशल से सफल होता है। उदयन के अलावा अमात्य यौगन्धरायण की भी इस नाटक में महती भूमिका है। वह बुद्धिमत्ता तथा नीतिकौशल का चूडान्त निदर्शन है। अन्य पात्रों में उज्जयिनी के राजा महासेन प्रद्योत प्रतापी राजा हैं। सर्वत्र उनके आधिपत्य का सम्मान है। वह गुणग्राहक है। मन ही मन वह वत्सराज उदयन के गुणों काप्रशंसक है। रुमण्वान तथा विदूषक दोनों स्वामिभक्त हैं। ‘प्रतिज्ञायौगन्धरायण’ भास के सफल नाटकों में अपना स्थान रखता है। कथानक का विन्यास, पात्रों का चरित्र-चित्रण, संवाद योजना एवं रसयोजना सभी का इस नाटक में सुन्दर समन्वय है। काव्यकला के परिपाक की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक उच्चस्तरीय है। इसमें राजनीति एवं कूटनीति का साम्राज्य है। स्वामीभक्ति का महत्त्व इस नाटक में सर्वत्र लक्षित होता है। सूक्तियों का इसमें प्राचुर्य है। स्वप्नवासवदत्तम्[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=14]

पूर्ण परिपाक को प्राप्त हुये हैं। मानव हृदय की सूक्ष्मातिसूक्ष्म भाव दशाओं का चित्रण इस नाटक में सर्वत्र देखा जा सकता है। नाटक का प्रधान रस शृंगार है तथा हास्य की भी सुन्दर उद्भावना हुई है। अविमारक[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=15] यह लोककथा सम्बन्धी छः अंकों का रूपक है। इसमें राजा कुन्तिभोज की पुत्री कुरंगी का राजकुमार अविमारक से प्रणय एवं विवाह का वर्णन है। नायक के आधार पर इसका नामकरण अविमारक रखा गया है। अविमारक का यथार्थ नाम विष्णुसेन था तथा अवि रूपधारी असुर को मारने से उसकी संज्ञा अविमारक है। नाटक का नायक अविमारक है। वह अतुलित पराक्रमशाली है। सहज पराक्रमशीलता तथा पर दुःखकातरता उसके स्वभाव के अंग हैं। इसी कारण वह राजकुमारी कुरंगी पर हाथी के आक्रमण करने पर उसे मुक्त करता है। अविमारक एक धीरललित नायक के रूप में इस नाटक में प्रस्तुत किये गये हैं। नाटक की नायिका कुरंगी है। वह रूपयौवन सम्पन्ना है। अन्य पात्र सौवीरराज तथा कुन्तिभोज हैं। नाटकीयता की दृष्टि से भास के अन्य नाटकों की तरह यह नाटक भी सफल है। सरल भाषा का प्रयोग नाटक की अभिनेयता में चार-चाँद लगा देता है, कथोपकथनों में स्वाभाविकता तथा भावांकन भास की अपनी विशेषता है। छोट - छोटे वाक्य, सरल भाषा, रसानुकूल एव पात्रानुकूल भाषा का प्रयोग इस नाटक को उच्चकोटि में ला खड़ा करता है। इस नाटक का प्रधान रस श्रृ गार है तथा अन्य रस उसके सहायक बनकर आये हैं। काव्यकला की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक नितान्त उदात्त है। परिस्थितियों , अवस्थाओं एव भावों का सटीक शब्दों एवं आलंकारिक भाषा में वणर्न सर्वत्र विद्यमान है। प्रकृति चित्रण में नाटककार पूर्णतया सफल रहे हैं। नाटक में सूक्तियाँ यत्र-तत्र बिखरी हुई हैं। प्रसिद्ध सूक्ति ‘‘कन्यापितृत्वं खलु नाम कष्टम्’’ का भास ने यहाँ उत्तर उपस्थित किया है - ‘‘कन्या पितृत्व बहुवन्दनीयम्।’’ इस प्रकार सभी दृष्टियों से यह रूपक प्रषस्त कहा जा सकता है। चारुदत्त[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=16] महाकवि भास की नाट्य श्रृंखला में चारुदत्त अन्तिम कड़ी माना जाता है। इसकी कथावस्तु चार अंकों में विभाजित है। शूद्रक के प्रसिद्ध प्रकरण ‘‘मृच्छकटिक’’ का आधार यही माना जाता है। इसमें कवि ने दरिद्र चारूदत्त एवं वेश्या वसन्तसेना की प्रणय-कथा का वर्णन किया है। एक अन्य पात्र शकार है जो प्रतिनायक के रूप में है। प्र मे के आदर्श की सामाजिक प्रस्तुति इसमें दृष्टव्य है। इस नाटक का नायक वणिक्पुत्र आर्य चारूदत्त है। उसी के नाम पर इस नाटक का नामकरण हुआ है। नाटक की सम्पूर्ण घटनाएँ उसी के सुकृत्यों पर केन्द्रित हैं। चारुदत्त की दरिद्रता का बड़ा ही मार्मिक चित्रण इसमें किया गया है। चारुदत्त अत्यन्त दानी, गुणवान् एव रूपवान है। दानशीलता के कारण ही वह दरिद्र हो गया है। चारुदत्त धीर प्रकृति का मानव है। वह कला मर्मज्ञ है। वह महान् धार्मिक है तथा निर्धनावस्था में भी पूजा एवं बलिकर्म सम्पन्न करता है। नाटक की नायिका वसन्तसेना है। वह उज्जयिनी की एक प्रसिद्ध गणिका है। वह अत्यन्त रूपवती है। शकार तथा विट उसके रुप-जल के पिपासु हैं। गणिका होते हुये भी उसका चारित्रिक स्तर ऊँचा है। वह चारुदत्त के गुणों पर अनुरक्त है। उसके एक-एक गुण वसन्तसेना के प्र मे को दृढ़ करते जाते हैं। शकार से रात्रि में रक्षा और विदूषक के साथ वसन्तसेना का सकुशल घर पहुँचाना, चेट को प्रवारक देना, वसन्तसेना के न्यास की चोरी हो जाने पर उस अपने स्त्री का अत्यन्त मूल्यवान हार देना - ये सभी गुण वसन्तसेना के हृदय में स्थायी प्रभा डालते हैं तथा वह स्वयं अभिसार के लिये उसके पास चल देती है। वसन्तसेना गणिका होने पर भी धन लोभिनी नहीं है। वह अत्यन्त उदार मनवाली नायिका है। नाटक के अन्य पात्रों में चारुदत्त का मित्र मैत्र य विदूषक है। वह जन्म का ब्राह्मण है। वह अपने मित्र का विपत्ति-सम्पत्ति दोनों समयों में साथ देने वाला है। मैत्र य संस्कृत नाट्कों में अन्य विदूषकों के समान केवल भोजनभट्ट मूर्ख ब्राह्मण नहीं है। वह समयानुसार उसके हित सम्पादन के लिए कठिन कार्यों को भी सम्पन्न करता है। शकार इस नाटक में खलनायक है। वह मूर्ख है। सामान्य से सामान्य बात का भी उस ज्ञान नहीं है। गुणवानों के प्रति उसका कोई आकर्षण नहीं है। वह वसन्तसेना के रूप पर मुग्ध है तथा बलात् उससे प्र मे करना चाहता है। यह नाटक दैव-दुर्विपाकवश अकस्मात् समाप्त हो जाता है तथा यह सहज में अनुमित हो जाता है कि अपने वर्तमान रूप में यह पूर्ण नहीं है। यह भी संभावना है कि इस नाटक की रचना करते समय भास की मृत्यु हो गई हो तथा इस प्रकार यह अधूरा रह गया हो। यह नाटक सरल व सुबोध है। चरित्र-चित्रण की दृष्टि से बेजोड़ है। नाना प्रकार क सज्जन से सज्जन तथा दुर्जन से दुर्जन यहाँ वर्तमान हैं। एक ओर चारुदत्त सज्जनता की सीमा है तो दूसरी ओर शकार दुर्जनता का चूडान्त प्रतीक है, कथोपकथन की दृष्टि से भी यह नाटक उच्च कोटि का है। इस नाटक में भास का कविहृदय भी पूर्णरूप से अभिव्यक्ति को प्राप्त हुआ है। प्रकृति का चित्रण भी स्वाभाविक एवं हृदयाकर्षक है। नाटक का प्रधान रस श्रृंगार है तथा अन्य रसों का भी समयानुसार सुन्दर प्रयोग किया गया है। इस नाटक में देशकाल का चित्रण बड़ा ही स्वाभाविक है। द्यूत का वर्णन दृष्टव्य है। दास-प्रथा का संकेत सज्जलक द्वारा वसन्तसेना की चोरी को मुक्त कराने के उद्योग से लगता है। चोरी का दृष्टान्त सज्जलक का कृत्य है। नाटक की भाषा सरल, सरस एवं पात्रानुकूल है। नाटकों का रचनाकाल[LINKED_TEXT: संपादित करें] [URL: https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8&action=edit&section=17] भास और उनके नाटकों का अविर्भाव निश्चय ही कालिदास से पूर्व और संभवत: अश्वघोष के बाद हुआ था। उनसे पूर्ववर्ती नाटककारों के रूप में केवल अश्वघोष का नाम, कदाचित्, लिया जा सकता है। गणपति शास्त्री, पुसलकर आदि ने उपर्युक्त नाटकों का

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"I’m sorry to know that your family wants to have your cat killed rather than investigate what’s going on with her. If you’d been throwing up and/or had diarrhea, they would know that something was wrong and probably take you to the doctor. They may not value your cat’s life, which is sad. These behaviors are symptoms of a hidden issue. Some possibilities have been noted in the answers: Stress from something or someone new in the house. Routine changes can be upsetting to cats. Stress between humans can cause stress in a cat.Urinary tract infection, which is painful, as you may know. It’s difficult to know the cause of this, but a diet of dry food, lack of fresh water, dirty litter box can be contributing factors. The vet will give pain medicine, usually liquid Bubprenorphine, and anti-biotics like Clavamox. A urinalysis may reveal crystals, which are sharp and painful when the cat urinates.Digestive issues, which can be caused by food allergies or swallowing too much fur. Long haired cats need to be brush and combed daily so they don’t ingest so much fur when grooming. A “de-shedding” tool can be very helpful. I don’t know where you live, but they can be ordered online. I have several different ones, but my favorite is the “Shed Monster” that I bought at Walmart for 7. It works better for my cat than the 40 Furminator. Another one I like is made by Sargeant, and has two sets of teeth that are easily flipped from one to the other. One is like a large tooth comb and the other is more like flea comb teeth which gets the loose undercoat fur. I use the large tooth end first to check for mats. The cost to euthanize your cat by a vet would cost about the same or close to an exam and urinalysis. Most reputable vets won’t euthanize a healthy cat. Although your cat is not healthy, her issues are treatable. If your family won’t support you in helping her, then the best thing to do is surrender her to a no-kill shelter. She has a good chance of being treated, and put up for adoption by someone who knows how to care for cats. My own cat has recently shown that she had a UTI because she started peeing outside her box, and making lots of unsuccessful attempts to pee in the box. She also cried. I took her to the vet after I observed this for a day. The urinalysis showed crystals, which surprised me because I give her commercial raw cat food along with some high quality dry at night. I also mix in a little D-Mannose, which is a preventative for bacterial infections in the urethra. I didn’t get her urine cultured to see if it was bacterial, because of the extra cost. She got anti-biotics (just in case) and pain medicine. That was about a week ago, and I can see that she’s back to normal. I took away the dry food for awhile, and gave her only raw meat. (thin slices of beef and chicken) The urine needs to be on the acid side in cats, and raw meat is helpful. I don’t know if she still has crystals, and I’m researching ways to dissolve them, even though she’s not straining in the box anymore. I’ve been under extreme stress, and cats are sensitive to this, so she may have picked up on this. Stress in humans or animals can cause health issues. So, de-stressing is a very critical element in treatment. Please let me know your response to this, and your next steps. It’s hard to love your kitty, and be unable to do what’s needed. I feel for you, and hope this answer helps."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"I don’t know, probably “Dying Inside,” by Robert Silverberg.

No, you can’t do this. You’ve been given some reasons in other answers. I’ll elaborate on one additional one. In order to equate one quantity with another, the two must have the same dimensions. Charge difference would have the dimension of charge. the correpsonding SI base units would be ampere-seconds. The dimensions for potential difference correpsond to SI base units of kilogram-meter[math]^2[/math] per Ampere-seconds[math]^3[/math], which is the volt. Coulonb’s law for the force between two charges, from which the equation for potential difference can be obtained, has a constant in it, as do most such laws, such as the law of universal gravitation. Aside from making sure that the answer comes out numerically correct, these constants also are responsible for converting units from, in this case, charge and distance to potential difference. If you are unfamiliar with dimensional analysis, you should become so because it is a useful tool for detecting mistakes. If you start off with some dimenstions such as charge and distance and wish to calculate potential difference, and at the end of the calculation you answer does not have the dimensions appropriate for potential difference, then your answer is wrong. If the dimensions are correct, it still does not mean that your answer is right; for instance, you might have omitted a dimensionless constant such as [math] pi [/math] or [math] sqrt{2}[/math] but at least you have some assurance that you are on the right track. 12–31–2020"},{"instruction":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","output":"The tallest mountain in the solar system.

I’m probably still considered ‘overweight;’ but my life has vastly improved nonetheless. There is probably nothing more socially debilitating than being morbidly obese. Not being able to fit into a standard chair was one of the most humiliating aspects of social interaction for me. From those office chairs with arms to those unforgiving football stadium seats, chairs became a big issue for me. I remember being at some outdoor event where the choice was sitting in a standard lawn chair, standing or sitting on the ground. Standing for a long time was painful on my back, so sitting on the ground while there were available lawn chairs became an embarrassing thing to explain to all those normal-sized people who INSISTED I sit in a lawn chair. No, folks, I’d never be able to get OUT of it, thanks. I’d have to wear it home…you know? The physical limitations for me were daunting. Having no endurance for simple tasks like stair climbing or shopping was not only physically terrible, but took a mental/emotional toll as well. Not being able to sit on the floor in a kneeling position (as it was too painful) was frustrating. Knowing if I actually got down all the way to SIT on the floor made me soon realize I’d have a terrible time trying to get up off the floor again. Normal things like this that most people never have to think about, until maybe they are elderly. I could go on and on (maybe I should write a book), but these were the most challenging and difficult aspects to being morbidly obese for me personally."},{"instruction":"What do you think, is Robert Mueller lying or telling the truth?","output":"The question is ridiculous, if after two 2 and you only got 1 answer and that's the best you got….

Outside of even that, both Kakashi and Guy get immensely more powerful through the course of the 4th War to the point they could easily challenge all of the Akatsuki by themselves. Pretty much everyone below Obito would get outright blitzed by either of them including Pain & Itachi. Sage Mode Naruto could percieve Pain's movements and I'd argue was half a breath faster at CQC, while Itachi is outright stated to be less powerful than Pain (talking about Sick Itachi). Kakashi easily blitzed numerous jinchuriki comparable to KCM1 Naruto in speed & Guy's movements in 7th Gate were beyond anything Gaara percieved prior to his fight with Jūbidara, including those of lightened V2 Ay & Edo Madara. Deidara can fly but even with that, nothing's protecting him from getting vaporised by the residual force of one single hirudora, which easily has more AoE than any aerial height he can fly up to. Said Hirudora also plows through all three hundred of Sasori's puppets, stomps a mudhole through Hidan & blows up whatever Susano'o Itachi manages to conjure up (if he can do it in time, which he can't). Meanwhile, Kakashi casually blitzes Kakuzu with one lightning blade, literally smashes through every Path of Pain, decapitates Kisame & probably burns all of Konan with a single fire jutsu. A fully powered Catastrophic Shinra Tensei (the Konoha busting kind) will not even tickle Kakashi's mud walls, which can tank Uchiha Madara level fire release (who could pull off higher AP than the CST with BARE PUNCHES) and a Chibaku Tensei core will just get warped in a microsecond by Kamui (if Guy can't just blow it up alone). The ONLY people remotely relevant to this topic at all are Edo Nagato, Edo Itachi & War Mask Obito. Nagato is the weakest of those three, but still comfortably above KCM1 Naruto level. Then again, so is Kakashi/Guy and they have better feats than just being “vaguely” above KCM1 Naruto. Nagato has a better arsenal, but he's also stated to have shit mobility & actually needs to summon beasts to reliably react to Kakashi or Guy. In his white haired form, his durability is low enough that he can just about be one shotted by a lone hirduora blast (furthermore because he can't absorb it). If we're allowing him his full healthy state (which he has to absorb chakra to get to), he has a shot but he still can't beat Kakashi & Guy working together especially if you consider Late War Kakashi being able to react on par with and move at relative pace to KCM Minato who in turn scales above EMS Sasuke who's above Edo Itachi who's blatantly blitzed Nagato on panel twice in broad daylight with Nagato being amped up by his summons. For that last point I'd say Kakashi can take out Edo Itachi as well. His speed scaling is pretty much better & he could already draw counters to all of Itachi's genjutsu by the begining of Shippuden & stated Itachi wouldn't be able to catch him a second time. Even if Itachi could trap him in Tsukuyomi there is no real evidence he could do it before Kakashi places a Kamui warp off his head & IMO it's biased to suggest Tsukuyomi would land faster than Kamui if both go at it at the same time (especially since both scale to the speed of the user's perception and Kakashi's perception is higher than Itachi's). Using something like Boruto Era Kakashi is even more blatant mismatch considering he's hilariously more powerful than his War self. The only opponent I would say both lose to is War Mask Obito considering he alone would be able to summon seven powerful Jinchuriki & his own Kamui has been shown phasing through Kakashi's speed. Even then by the end of the War Kakashi could react and throw a KUNAI faster than Jūbimadara could throw a TSO at his direction, with the latter being fast enough to completely shut off Obito's attempts to phase into Kamui altogether. That and he could already physically contend with him, nearly kill him with one Raikiri, etc etc. Guy and Kakashi would lose at this point with the sheer numbers but that too with extreme difficulty but in all honesty, Boruto Era Kakashi is so absurdly powerful he can probably pull it off on his own. He's atleast a blitz tier faster than everyone else and even with lacking hax, should still be able to pull off war arc+ levels of firepower."},{"instruction":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","output":"There are many natural remedies that can help relieve lower back pain. I have included some of them try to enjoy an anti-inflammatory drink every day when you consume anti-inflammatory foods regularly, several antioxidant anti-inflammatory and even anti-cancer agents can build up in your blood. Over a period of time these potent agents can play a significant role in reducing and or eliminating inflammatory reactions in the body. Try consuming these healthy drinks on a regular basis may help reduce your back pain. Some examples of anti-inflammatory drinks include turmeric milk, tart cherry juice, and ginger-green tea. Fall asleep faster and sleep longer when you have a restful night’s sleep your back will then feel less sore during the day. Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night. Avoid prolonged static posture. Sitting or standing for long periods of time can cause your muscles to become strained and fatigued. To avoid this, try to change positions frequently throughout the day. Use ice and or heat therapy Ice packs this can help reduce inflammation and numb soreness while heat therapy can help relax muscles and improve blood flow. Stretch your hamstrings twice daily. Tight hamstrings increase stress across the lower back and can cause back pain. To stretch your hamstrings, lie on your back with both knees bent and place a rolled-up towel under the ball of one foot. Straighten your knee and slowly pull back on the towel until a stretch is felt in the back of your thigh. You can try acupuncture. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical practice that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. It has been shown to be effective in treating chronic back pain. Practice yoga regularly. Yoga is an excellent way to prevent and relieve back pain because it strengthens your core muscles which support your spine If you have severe or persistent back pain, it’s important to see a doctor.

However, it's always a good idea to do a patch test before using it on your entire face to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction or irritation. Leaving aloe vera gel on your face overnight can help to hydrate and soothe your skin, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. Aloe vera gel is known for its moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and irritation. If you decide to leave aloe vera gel on your face overnight, it's important to make sure you're using a pure, high-quality product that doesn't contain any added ingredients that could irritate your skin. You may also want to cover your pillow with a towel or use an old pillowcase, as the gel can sometimes transfer onto your bedding. Overall, using aloe vera gel on your face overnight can be a safe and effective way to improve your skin's hydration and overall appearance, but as with any skincare product, it's important to listen to your body and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions. Additionally, it's important to note that aloe vera gel is not a substitute for a comprehensive skincare routine. While it can help to soothe and hydrate your skin, it's important to also cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize your skin regularly to maintain its health and appearance. If you have any concerns about using aloe vera gel on your face, or if you have a pre-existing skin condition, it's a good idea to consult with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional before using it. They can provide guidance on the best skincare routine for your individual needs and help you avoid any potential risks or complications. In summary, using aloe vera gel on your face overnight can be a safe and effective way to moisturize and soothe your skin, but it's important to use a pure, high-quality product and to listen to your body and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"To pick a best [LINKED_TEXT: Mobile App Development Company in Chicago] [URL: https://bit.ly/2g8LFTx] from various is not a simple task.

Assuming a person started by eating or preserving the most perishable foods first (salting and pickling meats and veggies, drying out some fruits, maybe even making jerky if the deli ovens are working the first day), there should be hundreds of pounds of meats, and several hundred pounds of produce. Dairy would be a problem. If the power stayed on, you’d have milk for 3 weeks, and yogurt for a couple months. It’s probably best to put as much in the freezers as possible.

How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","output":"They are quite different. Google's system uses an expensive 64-beam LIDAR to localize itself to within 10cm on a detailed pre-existing map. It's incredibly precise. It also uses the LIDAR data to build a 360 degree world model that tracks and predicts movements for all nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles, so it's able to plan intelligent paths through complex highway or urban environments. Tesla's system is reportedly based on monocular forward-looking camera technology from Mobileye. This means it's very unlikely that Tesla's system can localize itself on a map, at least to the degree needed to accomplish lane keeping (GPS isn't reliable enough). However, the forward-looking camera can pick up the location and curvature of highway lane makers, which is more than enough to simply keep the car in its lane and accomplish basic lane change maneuvers. Each of these systems excels in its own domain. Tesla's is low-cost and will likely be effective at accomplishing Elon Musk's goal of automating 90% of driving within a few years. But handling the last 10% of driving situations is very, very hard. Google created the 90% solution years ago and accurately predicted others would follow soon after, so they decided to focus on solving the really hard problems that will give them a major, potentially even monopolistic advantage in the long run."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Homemade Healthy and delicious Smoothie for every human disease extracted from The Ayurveda: Ayurvedic Super SmoothieHomemade Healthy and delicious Smoothie for every human disease extracted from The Ayurveda: Ayurvedic Super Smoothie eBook : Bhattacharya, Sukanta: Amazon.in: Kindle Storehttps://www.amazon.in/Homemade-delicious-Smoothie-extracted-Ayurveda-ebook/dp/B0BX4KFYC7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14Z3XNGC4FSN7&keywords=Homemade+Healthy+and+delicious+Smoothie+for+every+human+disease+extracted+from+The+Ayurveda&qid=1677750687&sprefix=homemade+healthy+and+delicious+smoothie+for+every+human+disease+extracted+from+the+ayurveda%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1] [URL: https://www.amazon.in/Homemade-delicious-Smoothie-extracted-Ayurveda-ebook/dp/B0BX4KFYC7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14Z3XNGC4FSN7&keywords=Homemade%20Healthy%20and%20delicious%20Smoothie%20for%20every%20human%20disease%20extracted%20from%20The%20Ayurveda&qid=1677750687&sprefix=homemade%20healthy%20and%20delicious%20smoothie%20for%20every%20human%20disease%20extracted%20from%20the%20ayurveda%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1]"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","output":"There are a few tricks that will help you get lower prices at hotels"},{"instruction":"w do I create a text file list of the contents of a folder?","output":"Use the find utility on unix.

It does not matter what size it is its road worthiness is tested as a car. The difference comes when you wish to drive it. A motorhome that weighs over 3500 Kgs is classed as a heavy vehicle, and must be driven on a LGV (Large Goods Vehicle) licence. This is the same licence you need to drive a truck. The Government realises it takes greater skills to drive a large vehicle so a car licence is no good.

If you want to change the volume you adjust the output from the pre-amp and then the amplifier just does its thing. CO2 is the control knob, even if H2O is doing the heavy lifting. CO2 levels determine the initial amount of heating, which then gets amplified by H2O. More heat due to added CO2 puts more H2O in the air, which traps more heat, etc. until a new (higher) equilbirium level is reached. The amplification doesn’t become runaway because the amount of heat being radiated increases as the fourth power of the temperature, and that acts as a strong brake on temperature increases. We can’t control H2O levels directly, because they will very quickly revert to the current equilibrium value, either by increasing evaporation to add H2O if the level is below equilibrium or by condensation to remove H2O if it’s above equilibrium. But we can affect CO2 levels and thus add direct heating from the CO2, plus additional heating from the newly raised equilibrium level for H2O. And people tend to focus on the things they can control."},{"instruction":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

It’s sickening to watch the bottom lickers being cowards and not doing their job. Trump sends people out? So all leave and report why … brt no, they are too scared to stand up and fight and tell the public what’s happening. In the US it’s about brainwashing and dumbing down and being afraid. That’s NOT journalism. That’s being afraid to stand out and do a job that should be reporting the truth. We in the UK make mistakes in journalism, we have had horrific instances of phone tapping for example. Our press can be totally intrusive and annoying and they print lies too.

The platform didn’t rise to my expectation. The database was inaccurate A few months after that, a former colleague of mine recommended me Voogy and I booked a demo. The platform opened so many possibilities. I was able to narrow down by my ICP and get accurate data based on my Buyer Persona. The developers installed a feature that enables you to predefine the Buyer Persona from the very beginning. The bounce-back guarantee was another touch that I liked because it allowed me to prospect more in case of the inaccurate data. The feature that I consider a game changer is the Auto Prospector. Basically, it does all the work for me: it prospects by my ICP and by Buyer Persona and engages with them through an inbuilt sequence engine. From 4 hours that I used for prospecting to 40 minutes a day, this platform gives me more time to focus on closing close deals."},{"instruction":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","output":"As a resident of Manhattan, I have been familiar with Donald Trump for over 40 years. In 1979 I worked for two weeks as a management trainee for the new Grand Hyatt Hotel which was an overhaul of the derelict Commodore Hotel at 42nd St. This was a Trump project although he was a nobody compared to the other big-shots involved. I was supposed to work for free while I was in training. After my first week I was told that I was being promoted to a more advanced program where I was expected to work another week without salary. After another week I caught on that I was being scammed and took another job. I remember that the the Grand Hyatt project did not do well and there was a big lawsuit between Trump and the City over a tax dispute. Over the next few decades I watched as Trump performed his antics. At first, I found him mildly entertaining but my disgust grew as his virulent racism and bigotry became more and more obvious. Occasionally, during the ‘90s I would hear him saying crude, vulgar things on the Howard Stern Show, a place for crude, vulgar things. I vividly remember his vicious racial attacks on the Central Park Five which continued long after they were exonerated by DNA evidence. I avoided “The Apprentice” since I have no stomach for “reality TV.” Everything I observed about him disgusted me especially his treatment of women and minorities. His pursuit of “birtherism” was the final straw. I often said, “If this guy ever gets in the White House it will be the end of our democracy, if it doesn’t get us all killed first.” Looks like I was right. I believe we will someday discover his financial empire was a fraud and that he is financially controlled by Russian oligarchs."},{"instruction":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible?","output":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible?

So I would move my eyes to making the world bigger so as to allow more things to do. Maybe you implement a random quest system that makes people run up to you asking for aid in a task. This makes it so even after beating the game you always have a job to do or a base/camp to clear out. In games with trains have them be drivable.

So yeah , I saw the picture a day before and all I could say is that it touched my heart❤️. I’m not a fan of love stories, I rarely watch them, but Dil Bechara proved to be an exception, just because it was the last of legacy of our own “Apna Hero” Sushant Singh Rajput. So , when I was watching this movie , during the last 30 minutes I cried so hard that I almost choked . And I am not exaggerating . I literally found it difficult to breathe . I don't know the fact that Sushant is really no more made the death seem realistic . His smile 💔 The story is set in Jamshedpur and revolves around Kizie and Manny, two individuals with contrasting personalities who have a really unfortunate common trait- cancer. Adapted from John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars, the movie doesn’t come up with any surprise in terms of plot and the story. Manny and Kizie’s battle with cancer and their subsequent struggles to just make their lives feel normal hits at an emotional level as to how we tend to take this life for granted and seldom appreciate the normal in our lives. This may sound like an overstatement, but Dil Bechara is a movie for our generation which is so lost and broken in the pursuit of future, that it has forgot to enjoy the present. Immanuel Rajkumar Jr. aka Manny aka Apna Hero SSR, a Rajinikanth fan and a Bollywood buff believes that life is a gift and must be lived to the fullest, pretty much evident from his dialogue- “जन्म कब लेना है और मरना कब है, ये हम डिसाइड नहीं करते. पर जीना कैसे है, वो हम डिसाइड कर सकते हैं.” Having seen him in Kai Po Che , MSD, Sonchiriya and Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! I won’t say this was Sushant’s best performance till date, but there was something different about this one. Earlier, upon seeing him giving excellent performances, the mind always said, “This guy, who represents all of us small town kids, all of us who chose a safe profession but were hustlers in our mind, will go miles ahead and be what he always dreamed to be.” While watching Dil Bechara, this feeling was replaced by the realization that this will be the last of him, the last of his legacy, the last of our own hero, who had his head held high in the sky with his feet firmly grounded. Dil Bechara may not be the last or the best love story I ever come across, but it will always bear a special place in my heart, such was the impact of the movie and the actors. A few takeaways from the movie I wanted to share- Live in the present, enjoy every moment. Life is too unpredictable to be taken for granted Appreciate the normal in your life, what’s natural to you is a dream for somebody If your brain tells you it’s silly to do something, it probably is, but if that silly something makes you feel wonderful and changes your life for good, go ahead and do it You live in the people who love you, even after you’re long gone. Make them your priority, you’ll never regret it! I would give Dil Bechara a 10/10 because taking out even one point would be an injustice . If you get time , do watch this movie . At last a quote on life ( it's by me : no this isn't flaunting ) If I ever die and get a choice to go to heaven or be a ghost and return back , I'll chose the later . Why? Because I left my heaven behind when I died Thank you ❤️"},{"instruction":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","output":"Some of my favourite jokes troll bassists.

Bordered by the Lakes and Volcanoes District to the North, Argentina to the east, Southern Patagonia to the South and the Pacific Ocean to the west, Northern Patagonia can be reached in a number of ways, the most common being through the Balmaceda airport, served by flights from Santiago. Other options include driving along the Carretera Austral, parts of which are connected by ferries, or taking the small plane that flies from Puerto Montt. This enchanting and wild area, generously endowed with native forests, millennia-old glaciers, and outstanding adventures, awaits visitors all year round, although the weather is best between October and April. 2- Kamchatka // Russia There are few places in the world that can enthral quite like Kamchatka, easily Russia's most scenically dramatic region. A vast volcanic peninsula that is almost entirely wilderness, Kamchatka is a place of extraordinary primal beauty, rushing rivers, hot springs and snow-capped peaks. Getting here takes time and effort, and exploring the region even more so, but few visitors leave anything other than awestruck. Visitors to Kamchatka have traditionally been an intriguing mix of outdoorsy types and package tourists, both with deep pockets. Yet against all odds, Kamchatka has recently become viable for independent, relatively budget-conscious travellers. The capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, may be gritty, but it enjoys an incredible setting and has its share of easily accessible activities, including lift skiing into late May and some very doable volcano climbs. Kamchatka may not be a budget destination yet, but no longer is it strictly the domain of tycoons. 3 - Northern Forest Complex // Myanmar Spanning more than 12,000 square miles at the crossroads of India, Myanmar, and China, this vast landscape encompasses the highest mountain and the headwaters of the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin, the country’s most important river system, sustaining extensive rice farming that supports many local communities. Four protected areas embrace one of the region’s largest remaining expanses of natural forest, which host some of the region's greatest biodiversity, including what are believed to be its best remaining populations of tigers and elephants. These forests are also home to more than a million people who depend on the region's vast ecological resources, both inland and along the adjacent coastline. 4 - Southern Namibia The Namib is estimated to be the world’s oldest desert, and it’s one of the driest, least-populated places in the world.

Beyond this point, we’ve got a bunch of ideas as to what could be there to solve various open questions in physics; too many ideas, one might say.

Generally, the former would be called the energy frontier (we need more energy for higher-mass particles), and the latter would be called the precision frontier (precisely measuring particle properties). Some of the more interesting ideas include modifications of Higgs physics and new kinds of Higgs bosons that are heavier than the Standard Model Higgs, or strange decays for known particles. For instance, if the Higgs could decay into dark matter, then we would observe fewer Higgs bosons than we expect. There’s also interest in looking at heavier composite particles (particles made from the heavier quarks) and studying their properties, to add to our understanding of QCD, but I know significantly less about that."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Ecclesiasticus 18:6“As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.” Everything that God created is perfect in their creation.Nothing can be added to them in order to improve them, and the depth of God’s knowledge cannot be found out. Romans 10:3“For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” Man has used the wisdom of God to establish their own vanities upon Earth, and refused to submit to the True wisdom, knowledge, and understanding that leads to immortality. God’s work is perfect, and man has sinned against Him.Man cannot begin to fathom the depth of God’s precision. Hebrews 4:13“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” God is the Supreme Intelligent Being who has telepathy. Wisdom of Solomon 2:23“For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.” God made mankind in His immortal image. Wisdom of Solomon 2:24“Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.” It was through the rebellious counsel against His laws that man turned away because of the pride of their wicked heart. As a result, the generations of mankind are cursed with mortality until the Day of Redemption. Psalms 37:9“For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.” This life has many trials and is full of trouble.We must learn what Righteousness is and apply it to our life in order to receive salvation (preservation from physical and moral harm). Ecclesiasticus 17:1“The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into it again.” We are formed from the rich thick dark mud of the Earth.This is why we are called terrestrial beings.Terra meaning of the Earth. Ecclesiasticus 17:2“He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also over the things therein.” Our days are short and full of labor, but God has given us power to manipulate the things that are within the atmosphere of Earth. Hosea 4:7“As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.” The more we increased in numbers and knowledge, the more mankind’s heart turned wicked and rebelled against God. Judgment is coming upon the Earth to recompense the Evil, but gross darkness must cover the Earth first. Ecclesiasticus 17:3“He endued them with strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,” Mankind is made in the Image of God. We have been given power like the Most High, but on a weaker scale of ability. Ecclesiasticus 17:4“And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.” Nature has been appointed naturally to do service unto man.The creations on Earth are under our authority, to do with them as we choose. Thus some people seek to save the creation, and so desire to destroy it. Ecclesiasticus 17:5“They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.” Man has been given 5 senses to perceive the world around them with.Those 5 senses are Sight, Touch, Taste, Hearing, and Smell. In the 6th part God gave us a brain to contemplate what we perceive through our 5 senses, and in the 7th part a mouth and tongue for speech. Speech enables us to articulate the internal thoughts of our heart (mind). Ecclesiasticus 18:6“As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.” Nothing God created is imperfect, and the depth of knowledge concerning how God made everything is incapable of being found out. The natural body of man was created in the image of God, a perfect masterpiece weaved with the fingertips of God. If we want to know the deep and hidden mysteries concerning our soul and the world around us, we only need to open up the Book and Read. Without Truth we can do nothing of ourselves. John 14:6“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” Without Christ we cannot direct our way in Truth to live forever, and we all know that we must die one day. 2 Corinthians 5:10“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” It is called idolatry. Romans 13:1“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.” God is a Higher Power.He established the order that brought forth the ordinances we are subject to today. Genesis 1:1“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” God created Heaven and Earth. 2 Chronicles 20:6“And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?” The MOST HIGH Power of our forefathers, from ancient times past until now, is the Power in Heaven that rules over all of the kingdoms of man. None can withstand His power. 2 Chronicles 6:1“Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.” His throne is in the thick darkness of outer space, where people see UFOs. 1 Kings 22:19“And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.” His throne is in Heaven above, and He has an army of Spirits awaiting His command. Ecclesiasticus 43:9“The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.” The moon is the beauty of heaven, and glory of the stars, that gives light upon the Earth during the night. Ecclesiasticus 43:10“At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches.” The stars are spiritual beings that stand in their watches, meant to assist us. Psalms 104:3“Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:” He makes the clouds His chariot.🛸The clouds are the so-called UFOs. They are the chariots of God. Ezekiel 1:4“And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.” Ezekiel saw the heavenly creatures and the chariots (clouds) of heaven. It came like a whirlwind, a great chariot, with a neon brightness of fire that glows, enfolding itself upon the body. The color in the middle of it was like amber, a pure golden color. Ezekiel 1:14“And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.” The living creatures move to and fro like lightning. Revelation 1:7“Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.” Every man left alive on Earth will be in the Eastern Hemisphere. They will see Christ when He returns according to prophecy. He will come with the mighty Angels, the Clouds of Heaven.God appeared to Moses in the burning bush. Exodus 3:13 “And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?” Moses asked God for His name, because the Egyptians called upon many gods. Exodus 3:14 “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” God told Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”. This is the name given to Moses and the Israelites when he appeared as a flame of fire out of the burning bush. He said go tell the children of Israel that \\"I AM\\" sent you. In the ancient Phoenician Hebrew tongue the Israelites spoke, the English words \\"I AM\\" translates to AHAYAH. The phrase \\"I AM THAT I AM\\" = “AHAYAH ASHAR AHAYAH”. Exodus 3:15“And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” That is the name of the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob as a memorial forever unto all generations. The letters of His name are in all caps. No other name was given to man to call upon. Not Jehovah, Yahweh, Yahwei, YHWH, Yah, Jah, Lah, El Shaddai, Adonai, Yahuwah, Yahuwa, Yahuah, not even God (of ancient German origins) none of that. Just AHAYAH. This is His name forever, and ever, as a memorial unto all generations. Christ said: John 4:22“Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.” You have no idea what you worship. We who believe in the Heavenly Father know what we worship. Safety from moral and physical harm is of those who keep His commandments. Revelation 22:14“Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” This is why the Book of Revelation says, “Happy will be those who obey the Word of God”. They will be able to receive the Kingdom of Heaven. Revelation 22:15“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.” Those who do not receive the Kingdom are man of impure minds, workers of witchcraft bewitching the minds of the people, people who have sex outside of marriage, unrepentant killers, people who choose t live according to their own Way of Life on Earth without submitting to the Original Purpose that God created man to fulfill, and all talebearers who create and spread lies. THIS IS NEW TESTAMENTThe Disciples of Christ wrote this understanding in the New Testament to bring forth the Truth in Christ. John 7:38“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” WE must believe on Christ as it is written. 1 John 3:4“Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” Sin is the breaking of God’s laws. Romans 6:23“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The payment for sin is death. The wages for living according to the Word of God is immortality. 1 John 1:6“If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:” If we profess to be a Christian, and do not keep the commandments, we lie and live in sin. Paul is showing us something. Romans 6:20“For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.” When we did not live according to the Word of God, we lived in sin. Romans 6:18“Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.” After we repented and got baptized into the Body of Christ for forgiveness of our sins, we became the servants of Christ who live in righteousness. Christ made it clear: John 3:5“Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” No man can receive Immortality and enter into the Kingdom of God unless they repent, get baptized into His body, and keep the commandments. UNDERSTANDING BAPTISM - PART 1 UNDERSTANDING BAPTISM - PART 2 Romans 6:21“What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.” Nothing we do can give us immortality, except obeying His word. Every other path leads to death in the end. 2 Esdras 16:66“What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels?” No man can hide anything from God. Ecclesiasticus 23:19“Such a man only feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts.” Hebrews 4:13“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” He is the Supreme Intelligent Being. He has telepathy. None is more powerful than He, and all are exposed before His eyes. Wisdom of Solomon 11:23“But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.” He winks at our sins, because He wants us to repent from our sins, worship Him, and receive eternal life. Acts 17:30“And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:” All man should repent and receive immortality. Acts 17:31“Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” The Day of Judgment approaches. 2 Corinthians 5:10“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” We must all stand before the throne of His Christ in the Day of Judgment, to receive rewards for every action we committed while we lived on Earth. Good rewards for good deeds, and bad rewards for bad deeds. Romans 7:12“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” The laws of God are just, holy and good. If man wants to do good while he lives, he must apply the laws of God to his life. Romans 7:14“For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” The laws of God are spiritual. The ways of man are fleshly and carnal. Baptism into Christ and keeping the commandments gives us the Holy Spirit. Acts 19:1“And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,” Paul came across certain disciples on his travels. Acts 19:2“He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.” He asked them if they received the Holy Spirit since they started believing in Christ. They replied no. Ecclesiasticus 32:24“He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.” Believe is an action word. Those who believe in Christ will keep His commandments. Acts 19:3“And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.” Paul asked who they were they baptized under, and they replied under the baptism of John. Right here we can see that people can be baptized and still not receive the Holy Spirit. Acts 19:4“Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” John’s baptism of repentance prepared the hearts and souls of the people to receive Christ when His ministry began. Acts 19:5“When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” The disciples had to get baptized into the Body of Christ. Acts 19:6“And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.” Hands by an ordained minister of God had to be laid upon them, and then they were able to receive the Holy Spirit. 2 Esdras 16:67“Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble.” In order to be saved, we must repent from our sins, live according to the Way that God ordained from Genesis to Revelations, and follow His word in order to fulfill prophecy, be delivered from condemnation, and receive immortality in the Kingdom of God. Believing in anything else is vain and futile.You are wasting your time. Isaiah 55:2“Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.” Why waste your time with things that cannot profit you after death? Psalms 53:1“The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.” The fool does not believe in God. He lives how he pleases on Earth, according to his own understanding, and not according to the instruction of God. Proverbs 8:5“O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.” God wants us to be of an understanding heart, to learn Righteousness and receive His instruction. Ecclesiasticus 10:12“The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.” Pride is when a man’s mind is turned away from the will of his Maker. Psalms 53:2“God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.” God knows we seek peace, love, joy, mercy, gentleness, goodness, and something to place our time and efforts into that will profit our soul. Psalms 53:3“Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.” Man has turned his heart away from his Maker, even God. They do not choose to LIVE. They choose to walk in the opposite path that leads to EVIL. The word LIVE backwards is EVIL. This is why God says the fool on Earth is gone backwards. They do not submit to His laws of Righteousness. Romans 1:21“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” Wicked men know what is good, yet they choose to follow after the evil. Romans 1:25“Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.” Changing that which is upright into a vain image of the creature so that mankind all over the Earth can honor and worship the creatures of God more than their Creator. Christ said: John 4:24“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” We must worship the Heavenly Father in Spirit and Truth. Psalms 119:142“Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” The Laws of God are the Truth. Romans 7:14“For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” The Laws of God are spiritual. Proverbs 6:23“For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:” The Laws of God are the light we must walk in to become immortal. Romans 7:12“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” The Laws of God are good.Man must walk in the Laws of God to do good. Matthew 5:16 “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” Christ commands His disciples to let the light shine among mankind, so they can see our good works and glorify our Heavenly Father whose dwelling is not on Earth, but in the thick dark Heaven above. Matthew 5:17“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.” Christ was not crucified to destroy the laws under the Old Covenant. He came to fulfill the Law of Sacrifice under the Old Covenant. Acts 3:18“But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.” Christ suffered on the cross to fulfill the Law of Sacrifice. Romans 3:20“Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” Keeping the Laws of God without being baptized into the Body of Christ will no longer justify us before the eyes of God. Romans 3:21“But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;” Hebrews 10:12“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;” Christ shed his blood on the cross, to be a sacrifice for all sin. Romans 3:22“Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:” To believe means to keep the commandments. All who truly believe in Christ must, repent from their sins, get baptized into His body, and keep the Laws of God. Ephesians 2:8“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:” Our salvation is Christ is not from our Faith alone, it is a gift freely given from the Heavenly Father. Romans 3:30“Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.” God will justify all man by the Faith of Christ. Romans 3:31“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” Do we continue living in sin just because we are under the Grace of God? Paul and Apostle of Christ says, No. We establish the Laws of God. Hebrews 9:16“For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.” Christ had to die in order for the New Covenant to be established. Hebrews 9:17“For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.” While Christ walked the Earth as a mortal man, the Old Covenant was still in effect. Colossians 2:16“Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:” Now that Christ has been crucified, we are to keep the Holy Days of God in Christ. No longer is animal sacrifice required to purge our sins when we seek forgiveness. No longer can people legally put us to death for breaking certain laws of God found under the Old Covenant. Colossians 2:6“As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:” We must now walk in the light. We know that the Laws of God are the light (Proverbs 6:23). 1 Peter 2:21“For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:” Christ let us the example to follow. We are to learn his ways and walk in them daily. 1 John 1:6“If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:” If we say we are Christians and do not keep the commandments of God, we are liars and do not exercise the Truth and Righteousness of God. 1 John 1:7“But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” But, if we repent, get baptized into the Body of Christ, and keep the commandments, we have fellowship with Christ and His blood covers our sins. Hebrews 10:16“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;” He will teach us His ways under the New Covenant, and they will be in our hearts continually. We will know the Laws of God. Romans 10:8“But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;” The word will be in our heart and professed by our lips, even the Word of Faith that all of His children will proclaim. Romans 10:9“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” That if we confess with our lips that we need Christ to save us, obey the commandments of His word, and even know that the Heavenly Father raised up Christ from the dead for our sakes, we will be saved. John 14:15“If ye love me, keep my commandments.” Christ said the only way we can show Him that we love Him, is by keeping His commandments, which is obeying His word. Christ is the Word of God. Hebrews 6:1“Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,” Another word for \\"Principles\\" is \\"Plan\\", and another word of \\"Doctrine\\" is \\"Teaching\\". Leaving the plan of the Teachings of Christ, let us mature in Christ as the scriptures teach. Not living in sin to follow after the desires and worldly lusts of our own heart, but sober and righteously as obedient children of God. Hebrews 6:2“Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.” The Doctrine of Christ includes:1. Instruction on washing and conversion teachings concerning baptism.2. Instruction for consecrating persons for ministry and the invoking of divine blessings.3. Teachings concerning the Resurrection of the dead in Christ.4. Teachings of the Eternal Judgment where all souls will be judged by Christ. Hebrews 6:3“And this will we do, if God permit.” These are the things that the true children of God will do all over the Earth for as long as God permits. Isaiah 66:24“And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.” All who chose to follow the commandments of man and not God while they lived on Earth, will receive the reward of eternal punishment or not honoring God and giving Him glory. The scriptures reveal the reward for those who choose to continue living in sin. They have to deal with the fact that they did not adore Christ while they lived, but despised his ways. The recompense allotted to lovers of wicked works is eternal punishment. To them belongs the unquenchable fire without end, and a certain fiery worm that never dies. It does not destroy the body, but continues in its eruption out of the body with never-ceasing grief. They will not have rest, even sleep will not give ease or comfort to them. Death will be no more, completely unable to free them from their torment one immortality comes. Daniel 12:2“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” My desire is to enjoy my new spiritual body on Earth forever, and not to be anyone’s trophy in Hell. No longer will the prayers of the righteous intercede to protect and preserve the wicked who choose to live in error. Hebrews 10:38“Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.” The just will live by the Faith of Christ on Earth. If any man disregards the lifestyle God commands in the Bible while the lived on Earth, the blood of Christ will not cover their sins. They blaspheme the Holy Spirit. Matthew 12:31“Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.” Christ will forgive our sins if we slip up, repent, and get back on track, but turning away from keeping the commandments of God will never be forgiven. 1 Thessalonians 4:16“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:” All who died and slept in Christ from the beginning, until this time, will be resurrected by His Highest's Holy Word. Matthew 25:31“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:” When Christ returns with the clouds of Heaven, He will rule over the Earth from the seat of Power. Mark 13:27“And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.” All over the Earth His chosen will be gathered. The dead in Christ will be resurrected. Matthew 25:32“And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:” All nations of man will be gathered unto Him in the Eastern Hemisphere, and the wheat will be separated from the tares. Matthew 25:33“And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” He will divide the righteous from the wicked. The righteous will be set on His right hand, and the wicked on His left hand. Matthew 25:34“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:” Happy are those who kept the commandments of God while they lived on Earth. They will be able to receive the Kingdom of God. Matthew 25:41“Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:” But, unto those who followed the Laws of Man and rejected the Laws of God, He will tell them to depart from Him and they will be cast into the Lake of Fire that has been prepared for the Devil and his angels. Even the devil has angels. Proverbs 3:5“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.” Follow Christ as it is written in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Psalms 119:142“Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” The laws that God established are the truth and His righteousness endures forever. Idolatry is when a man chooses to follow his will above the will of God. Micah 6:8“He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” Ecclesiastes 12:13“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.” Ecclesiastes 12:14“For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” Revelation 20:12“And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” The souls of man will be judged by the Laws of God. Did they serve Him while they lived, or did they only serve man for money and a means of survival. Luke 12:15“And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” Goods and substance alone does not guarantee life. Matthew 4:4“But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Our life is sustained by the Word of God. Joshua 1:8“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.” We are commanded to read out of the Word of God daily. This will bring us prosperity and good success. Success is not just the gaining of riches and accomplishing of feats on Earth as the majority of man leads us to believe. The wisdom to endure is what true success brings Success is supposed to prolong our days. 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐬 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐑𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲.We are the descendants of Noah. A royal people who have Power in God.

Ecclesiasticus 19:19“The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.” We were created to be immortal from the beginning, but we must learn how to stand in the Power thereof.

In September 1989, an IBM physicist [LINKED_TEXT: Don Eigler,] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd2dri9p_EI] became the first person ever to manipulate and position individual atoms. Less than two months later, he arranged 35 Xenon atoms to spell out the letters IBM. That was a most published image at the time. Writing those three characters took about 22 hours. Today, the process would take about 15 minutes. Once IBM researchers had the ability to position individual atoms, they had some fun. In 1993, they spelled the Kanji characters for the word atom using iron atoms on a copper surface. In 1996, The researchers also created the world’s smallest abacus with atoms. The abacus was created out of 10 carbon atoms and was seen as a milestone in nanoscale engineering. Moving the links of the abacus wouldn’t be easy and require the scanning tunneling microscope but with enough time and patience, it could be done. Image above: The world’s smallest abacus using atoms (left), Kanji characters for the word ‘atom’ (center) and a carbon monoxide man were some of the pictures created by moving atoms. In the “If you can read this, you are too close” image below, the letters are just 1 nanometer wide and 1 nanometer tall. Once they could manipulate individual atoms, the folks at IBM went to town - and have even created the world’s smallest movie, “A Boy and His Atom,” a short film that uses real atoms – carbon monoxide molecules – to tell the story of an atom boy playing with a single atom. The scientists utilized a massive tunneling microscope, operating at -268° Celsius, and moved the atoms frame by frame on a surface, then magnified it all 100 million times. To put it in perspective, if an atom were the size of an orange, an orange would be the size of Earth. - See more at: [LINKED_TEXT: IBM Creates World's Smallest Movie And ST Pics...

The longest eulogy in Vedas belongs to Shiva, he is heavily and frequently mentioned in all Four Vedas, the most famous Rudrashtadhyayi the Vedic eulogy is greatest longest than any other stuti of any other forms of Gods in entire Vedas. Now some elaboration with lots of citation directly from all Vedas. Asking where Shiva is in Vedas or Is Shiva or Ganpati or Vishnu a Vedic God, Is like asking are rain drops made of water ? or where is water in the ocean?. Now this is height of Idiocy, Ocean is full of water, drinkable or not its not the question but element water is everywhere in the ocean and greater part of life is thriving under ocean water in the whole earth. Similarly Shiva is everywhere in Vedas a gullible below avg may understand it or not. Because most people are unlearned who have actually not read Vedas or scriptures but like sheeps they simply follow some Daassas or TV wala baba, than vomit there sick minds false and ill knowledge. Here I would try to be precise but fact full because elaborating Vedas about Shiva, there so much of material that it will become a new Veda itself as it will be explanatory in metaphysical and scientific terms too. Because Shiva has inherent connection with science the scientific community recognizes him as Alpha and Omega for that they also have installed huge Nataraj Shiva,s Idol in front of HOLY GRAIL of science The Hadron collider LHC at the Heart of CERN. The point is when some one or say in plural,when human wanted to know greatest or most basic reason for this entire cosmos having infinite galaxies at the utmost humanly possible depth they have found it to be SHIVA.Hence the Vedic Rishis who were scientists of Meta Physical realm who USED TO FREQUENT BETWEEN PARALLEL UNIVERSES also researched and found Shiva or Rudra as the Greatest Tattwa, The final god The reason the Cause of all the Effects of the Universe and they have elaborated there research and described Shiva as greatest God ultimate. So even by science you wont stumble upon jesus or any other Sanatana Gods or so called human made Gods but, SHIVA ONLY ,the formless base of Universe the power of all the energy factor of universe.Dr. John Haglin, Einstien of this age, among scientists Describe Shiva of Vedas as Quantum Unified field, The power behind entire existence infinite Cosmos and all Big Bangs, which is reality and science of Shiva Lingam, Shiva Lingam is a technical and True shape of Godly Supra Energy Vortex the formless form of quantum unified field. To explain this we need another answer,but that will be a different subject, But the point is scientists and true seekers whenever they found ultimate truth through Spirituality or through Science have found ONLY SHIVA as Finality. From where nothing goes beyond every thing ends and emerges from here Only. So Here i will elaborate how Rig Veda than all other Vedic texts of all Four Vedas and there branches and cover verifiable Facts and truth, not hear say or any cults false doctrines But pure Vedic God Shiva, no Smriti or other Scriptures.Check How Sir and Dr John Hagelin describes Vedic Shiva as silent Ruler most powerful most beautiful the Alpha and Omega.[LINKED_TEXT: Dr. Hagelin Reveals The Reality Of The Silent Ruler Of The Universe Shiva As Expressed By The Superstring Of The Unified Field] [URL: http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=5030]. Vedas sing more eulogies of Shiva Rudra or Raudragni, Jaatveda Than any other Lord or Gods. Even from the very first Shloka Mantra of very first Veda The Rig Veda they started Singing praises of Rudra Shiva and his major eight forms which covers entire universe with five elements and Pran, Atman and Pradhan.If you will read the first Veda, It starts from praying Shiva Rudra from very first Shloka, “Agni milite Purohitam” , (Agni is Shiva or Rudras Form one of his eight Vedic manifestations). There are several Suktas dedicated only to him. In Rig Veda and in fact same is the case with other three Vedas Rudra Shiva is everywhere in Aranyaks, Bramhans, Upnishads, Gyan khand ,karma kand, Jyotish, vyakaran i mean, where you wont find him when you read how Vedas describe him its like looking for gold in mine full of gold and and some nerd asks where is gold in the mine, well it is still here not only one can see but one can experience it too. So Rudra is mentioned in Shlokas, Mantras, Suktas (for which You will have plenty of evidence from real text below in this write up) even whole Upanishads are dedicated to him only. The Gyan khand of Vedas which is main part of Vedas metaphysical science is known as Upanishads. Now among 108 Valid Upanishads of Muktika Cannon from all four Vedas more than 42 + (16 unpublished Upanishads) are dedicated to Shiva exclusively and inclusively. And That is more than half of total text, And that is much much more than any other single Gods eulogy in Vedas, How else glory of greatest God would be sung if not like this. In the Shatarudriya and in the whole Veda, Rudra is called Siva, Sankara, Sambhu, Isana, Isa, Bhagavan, Bhava, Sarva, Ugra, Soma, Pasupati, Nilagriva, Girisa, Mahadeva and Mahesvara among thousands of other names. Vedic Hymns The MahaRudrashtadhyayee. The most famous and Longest eulogy among all, The Rudrashtdhyayi which consists of Eight major Suktas belongs to Shiva Rudra Only, it is the Greatest Longest most powerful eulogy Vedas have ever sung for a Single God Head among all other Vedic Gods. In Shiva Rudra merge all Gods, The ShatRudriyam or Shree Rudra Sukta or Rudra Neela Sukta is repeated in all Vedas many times not only in Both Shukla and Krishna Yajurveda, than Rig Veda also has so many Rudra Sooktas, Atharva Veda and Saamveda have way many Suktas mantras for Shiva Rudra and his synonyms. This is most repeated eulogy in all Vedas and its various branches.Search net and find 1000 of links for Rudri at you tube, Shiva is the only Godhead for whom greatest and longest and most powerful eulogy was made, None other God commands such high respect, fear and awe that even Panch Bramhas bow in front of him (Ganpati Kartik, Durga, Vishnu, surya and Rudra). The Rudrabhishekam with Rudram MahaNyasam is one of the most elaborated methodical worship in Karma Kanda of any single Vedic God ever. The Worship ceremony is so powerful that even if it is still done rightly miracles do happen, ask any astrologer about, what he would consider the most powerful Upay or Solutions for things, he must suggest, all would suggest Mahamrityunjay Jaap ,Rudrabhsihekam and Shat chandi as most powerful solutions for any mundane or spiritual thing, thus still millions of people organize it and get what they want with simple good. Its sung in all major Shiva Temples everyday. And about this great eulogical Worship and this mantra scripture Declared that VR^ixasya mUlakena shakhAH puShyanti vai yathA |shive rudrajapAtprIte prItA evAsya devatAH |ato rudrajapAdeva bhuktimuktiprasiddhyataH || Even as by (watering) the roots of a tree, all its branches are nourished, so by pleasing Shiva with the chant of the Rudram , all the gods are pleased. Therefore, the attainment of bhukti - enjoyment - and mukti - liberation- is only through chanting the Rudram with devotion. Vedas saw and witnessed him as Final God, The God of all Gods, The father of Trinity, and whole universe, who has no body above him, there is no one beyond or second to him,”Eko hi Rudro na Dwiteeyay”.He is alone Swayambhu (Self Reliant) and (Beejak) Seed Giver of entire existence and Vishnu is Yoni (Womb) of universe, “Vishnurvishwa JagatYonih” Shiva is Reason of all the Causes and Cause of every Effect “Karnam Parama Kaaranat”.Vedas Declared him Sovereign Lord of all that exists, “Vishwadhipo Rudrah Maharshih”. (YajurVeda)The one in front of whom all Gods including Bramha and Vishnu have accepted there animal instinct, and declared him as Pashupati The lord of all gods and all beings “Sarwe Deva Pashutamvapu Swayam Tasmat Pashupatir Babhoov”. (Yajur Veda). The Only God head whose energies never depart from him, “īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam”. (Rig Veda) Who is above time the Kaala, the one and only Mahakaala and Sadashiva Rudra. “Yo Vampaden jaghan Kaalam”. He kicked Kaal and subdued him, he (Time) favours him and his bhaktas always.All Four Vedas were very peculiar, straightforward and truthful about Him. He was referred frequently as None like others, The one and Only without a second, No one but Him, “Sa Eko Rudro dheyah Sarvesham”, “ Eko Hi Rudro”, “Aek aiwa Shivo”, “Saeesh aesh aive Rudro”.Even they went to the extent to declare that, leave all Gods who are Pawns of MahaRudra instead worship Him only, through One pointed high Devotion. “Aek aiwa Shivo nityastato anyatsakalam mrisha tasmat sarwanparityajya Dhyeyaan Vishnawadikansuran” (Atharvaveda). These are the kind of ways Vedas tell about him and read Vedas they do not confer that status to any other God so highly and frequently, declaring the Code of Adwait, That the truth is God is one, Jeeva is fragment or Shiva God. Hence Jeeva is also Shiva, or to say that to become Shiva is Goal of every Jeeva because it is fragment of SHIVA. In Shwetashwatar Upnishad, all Rishis have assembled together and did “Shastrarth” research on Param Bramha God, they came to know that discussion wont be able to establish the truth hence they all meditated for several celestial years with an inquiry that who is that one from whom everything comes and merges in, who is existent before time who is that One Final God of Gods who has no body above, nothing beyond. And after many years and continuous Samadhi (Ultra Aplha State of Mind) it was Revealed to Bramha Rishi, Shwetashwatar he got enlightened and he floating in ether with immense bliss and divine illumination declared to all Rishis Thus spake the great Rishi in second shloka mantra of third adhyay (chapter) of Shwetashwatar Upnishad of YajurVeda, which is one of the prime 6 Upnishads :- Eko hi Rudro na dvitīyāya tasthurya imāṃl lokān īśata īśanībhiḥ / pratyaṅ janās tiṣṭhati saṃcukocāntakāle saṃsṛjya viśvā bhuvanāni gopāḥ // Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner Self of every living being. After having created all the worlds, He, their Protector, takes them back into Himself at the end of time. Not only this Upanishad but YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6, clearly states Rudra as Pashupati and Lord of sacrifices and as The Greatest One God without a second.. \\"Pasunam sarma asi sarma yajamanasya sarma me yacha Eka Eva Rudro Na Dvitiyaya Tasthe Akhusthe Rudra Pasuh Tam Jushasva.YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6. We Pray to Lord of all Sacrifices and The Lord of all Gods who is Rudra only the greatest Lord of entire cosmos who has none as second, and all beings and Gods are his Pets (Pashus) and he alone is there master there sole lord The Pashupati. Rudra is frequently referred in Vedas as Shiva, 'Shivo namasi' (Yaj. S. 3-63) clearly calls him Shiva than.The Famous and most popular among masses Panachkashar mantra of Shiva is Pure Vedic, the Central Mantra of all vedas, where other popular mantras are not Vedic necessarily, Panchakshar Mahavidya Mantra is established in the very heart of all Vedas deliberately in Yajurvedas the MANTRA occurs in Taittareeya . 4. 5, 1-41. \\"Namah shambhave cha mayobave cha namah Sankaraya cha mayaskaraya cha NAMAHA SH1VAYA cha Sivataraya cha\\" And the famous Shatarudriyam or RudraNeel Suktam or Rudrashtdhyayi which is highly praised in the Upanishadas and in the Purans & all scriptures, forms also the central portion of this central Veda. And this is a description of God as the all, the all in all, and transcending all, 'Visvadevo, Visvasvarupo, Visvadhiko.Rudra as Pashupati - lord of all beings including all Gods and humans and animals.Mohenjodaro a culture 7500 years ancient shows that Shiva Lingam and shiva as Pashupati was the main deity of those times in all over the world. A Pashupati Seal found there is very famous among archaeologists and anthropologists. And the Root of Pashupati is of course In Vedas. All over the world at even very unlikely places like Vatican or Africa or Greece archaeologists have found Shiva lingas which are millions or years ancient. In Vatican they have placed the ancient shiva linga at Vatican museum just beside the main church it is at least 10000 years old as per carbon dating, So it is very apparent that Shiva is the most ancient even the first God ever to be worshipped on this planet or universe.Shiva is declared as Pashupati in Vedas and Pashus (animals) are not what you think, Pashupati does,nt mean Lord of animals but entire universe and all Sentient beings and all Gods accepted that they are Pashus because of having animal instinct and being inflicted by Panch Pashas (Five affliction) which influence all beings even Bramha or Vishnu or Avataras are afflicted by these Five Pashas hence including them entire Universe of beings are Pashus (Pets of Shiva), and he alone is Pashupati there Master There owner. He is Lord of all beings who are afflicted with Five Pashas ( chains ) and everything that exists and gods are also chained by these pashas like lust, anger, false ego, envy and selfishness etc. All Devas accepted the truth of being pashus, including Vishnu Bramha and Indra and performed Pashupat Vow to appease shiva so he would absolve there pashas and set them free destroying these chains and establishing the jeeva in bliss of Shiva forever. Whenever Vishnu takes avatar he performs Pashupat Vrata, Bible also The God is called Shepherd and all beings as his flocks or Sheeps or animals, this allegory has root in this Vedic incidence only asserts scholars. How he came to be known as such, Here is the description-:Yajur Veda, 6th Kanda, 2nd Prasna, 3rd Anuvaka and 12th Mantra. Mahapuram Jayantiti ta ishum Samas Kurva to gnium anikan Soman Salyam Vishum Tejanam the bruvan ka imam asishatita Rudra iti aleruvan rudro vai Krura; Somya twiti, sobravit Varam Vrina aham eva Pasunam Adhipatirasaniti tasmat rudrah Pasunam adhipatishtam rudrova Srijat Satisra Puro bhitva ebhyo: lokebhys Suran pranudata.\\"There were the three cities of iron, silver, and gold (belonging) to Asuras. The gods not being able to win them (by fight) wished to win them by siege. (The great) say that He (the Brahmin &c), who knows (what ought to be known) and he (the non-Brahmin &c), who does not know - they are able to win by seige the great city which cannot be overtaken by fight:Then the gods made an arrow composed of Agni as (the bottom hilt) Soma as (the middle) iron and Vishnu as (the top) and declared (consulted) who will discharge it, and determined None but MahaRudra, (was) as only and Greatest God amongst them all, being capable of discharging such an apocalyptic weapon which carried all the weight and might of all Devas. Upon hearing such request) He (The Rudra) said the boon was made over, From Now on whole Universe must know the truth and accept that I am the Lord of Infinite Cosmos, all of you, all Gods and all beings are my Pashus (pets afflicted by five pashas ), hence all are Pashus both the two-footed Devas and manushyas and four-footed; So Rudra the Lord of Pashus, The Pashunampatim discharged it, broke up these three cities, and blew them up all from these worlds.\\" Aum namo bhagavate RudrAya In this Mantra, the Highest Reality, Brahman is identified with Rudra who is MASTER of Trinity who assigned the three functions of creation, protection or maintenance and dissolution of the universe to three Gods. The epithet Rudra means the destroyer of all that is false or evil, ignorance and their effects, sin sorrow and suffering and who confers wisdom and bliss the Rig Veda Rudra is the personification of Brahman in three rounded [LINKED_TEXT: a] [URL: http://aspect.in/]spect the later portion of the Veda, Rudra is described as Siva, the auspicious, as Mahadeva, the great God. Vedas also say about two aspects of Shiva viz., The Ghora meaning fierce the terrible and Aghora, Saumya meaning the benevolent kind and auspicious . The Upanishad speaks about Brahman as Rudra, its teaching lays stress on the destruction of Sin and Agyan (ignorance) by Shiva worship and great Spiritual progress.Rig Veda starts from praying to Shiva Agnimilite Purohitam ,and Agni is one of the eight manifestations of Rudra as mentioned above, Agni is also called Prana, and Prana is Rudra (Brihadaranyak Upnishad),Sashpinjaray twasheemate (Shatrudriya Shukla Yajurveda), says We bow to the God who is fire (Agni) flaming bright Red with a yellow divine hue. And there are many places where Agni, Rudra, Prana, Atman, Parmatman, are said to be synonyms and used in interpolating ways. The RigVeda 6.49.10 calls Rudra as “Bhuvanasya Pitraah” The Father of the Universe. Bhuvanasya pitaram ghīrbhirābhī rudram divā vardhayā rudramaktau | brhantam rshvamajaram sushmnam rdhagh ghuvema kavineshitās. “Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father. Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us. Now examine how else Vedas would describe the greatest Lord who is god of all Gods and entire universe. They revere him as “Bhuvansya Pitrah” ,the father of entire existence of beings and Cosmos, So he is not a simple Deity or warrior God as unlearned dumb people say but he is regarded as Supreme God Head, Father of entire universe who has no body above or beyond there is no body equal or second to him. He is sovereign Lord The Master of Entire existence, and this declares all Vedas Unanimously thousands of times and this assert Rig veda more in this Mantra The Rig Veda, 2.33.9 calls Rudra as \\"The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe\\" Iśānādasya Bhuvanasya .Sthirebhiranghaih pururūpa ughro babhruh śukrebhih pipiśehiranyaih | īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam ||' With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations: The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign God of this Universe , the All mighty.' Now Veda is mentioning Shiva Rudra as Iśānādasya, The soveriegn GODHEAD of bhuvanasya bhūrerna, Entire Universe three worlds all which exists and beyond. Or does any clearer words are needed to convey and understand logically and truthfully and honestly that Rudra or Shiva is regarded as Supreme most God Head who is self energized whose ultimate super most power never departs from him, who is father and guardian of entire Universe and all Gods and beings. Than Rig Veda 2.33.10 Na vā ojīyo rudra tvad astiA Mighter and Greater than you there is none, O Rudra. Rig Veda 7.46.1, Aṣālhāya sahamānāya vedhase. Rig Veda. 2.33.3. Tavastamas tavasāMightiest of the mighty. Whom no one may overcome. The most famous Shiva Mantra Tryambak Mantra or MahaMrityunjay mantra is in Rig Veda, Rig Veda 7.59.12. Tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam Urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality. kad rudrāya pracetase mīḍhuṣṭamāya tavyase। vocema śaṃtamaṃ hṛde(RigVeda 1.43.1) What shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise, That shall be dearest to his heart? RigVeda 2.33.8maho mahi suṣṭutim īrayāmī, gṛṇīmasi tveṣaṃ rudrasya nāmaḥ. I utter forth mighty hymn of praises.We sing the splendid name of Rudra. kumāraś cit pitaraṃ vandamānam prati nānāma rudropayantam (RigVeda 2.33.12) I have surrendered myself to you as a boy to the respected father approaching. bhiṣaktamaṃ tvā bhiṣajāṃ śṛṇomī (RigVeda 2.33.4) I hear you as the most curing among all curing. Haste vibhrad bheṣajā vāryāṇī śarma varma chardira (RigVeda 1.114.5) Whose hand filled of greatest miraculous medicines. Grant us refugee, protection and shelter. apabhartā rapaso daivyasyābhī (RigVeda 2.33.7) Deliverer from defect of the Gods.bṛhantamṛṣvamajaraṃ (RigVeda 6.49.10) bhūrer dātāraṃ (RigVeda 2.33.12) The giver of many.mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtā (RigVeda 7.59.12) who provides immortality through Moksha.Revealing of Desire of Rudra Consciousness RigVeda also reveals about state which sages seek where perfect thoughts of Lord Rudra comes to their mind. ie. Wishing of full mind devotion to Lord Rudra: ]ā te pitara marutāṃ sumnam etu (RigVeda 2.33.1) May your perfect thought come to us Oh father of Maruts.ā vivāseyaṃ rudrasya sumnam (RigVeda 2.33.6) May perfect thought of Rudra comes in mind. Lord Rudra in Vedas has one peculiar characteristic ie. He is stated as the one without second frequently . YajurVeda Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6 clearly states 'Eka Eva Rudro Na Dwitiya.' 'Rudra yields none to second.' Now a question arises whether this is just Arthavãda or has special significance. It is not Arthavãda because same verse is derived by Svetasvatara Upanishad in 3.1 and used as to glorify Brahman 'Eko hi Rudro Na Dwitiyaya... '. So, Lord Rudra is the one who is without second. Same thing is also revealed in Rudra Suktas of RigVeda: also Shivas fragment, which Shree Shankaracharya re established again.He is no regular God, He can absolve any Karma change destiny and capable of giving well being of all kinds here and in afterworlds. He is the greatest Surgeon greatest Healer The Vaidynatham. And he can liberate Give moksha to his Devotees Kaivalya Bramha . Those who worship him with devotion are devoid of death or any thing negative.All Vedas declare Shiva as Most terrifying Destroyer of Gods and Death even (Ghora), and also consider him as Ultra benevolent greatest healer and happiness giver who can enlighten and change destiny if needed for welfare of his Devotee a bhakta, (Aghor) who protects and prospers his worshipers.Now here i would mention the Upanishads which are dedicated to Shiva only. As gyanis know that upanishads are the main part of vedas, among 108 Upanishads as per Muktika canon half of them are dedicated to Shiva, so one can imagine what authority superiority Shiva has in Vedas or even Puranas or tantra Shiva is everywhere like water in the ocean and always revered as Greatest God as he is famously Called Mahadev (The Greatest God of all Gods).Its not that, that only Shaiwa Upnishads praises Shiva but in Vaisnava, Shakta, Ganpatya, Sauree (sun worship), GyanYog, Sanyas based Upanishads etc also consider Shiva as greatest God. Examples are thousands but i will write three that will suffice as even a glimpse of truth is enough to establish it.Mahanarayan Upanishad which obviously praises Vishnu shows him as ParBramha, In this Upnishad also when rishis assembled and contemplated on greatest God the Finality to whom shall they devote themselves the final greatest God as they say here Kim Deva Havisha Vidhem, they also conferred that God to be Shiva Rudra only and this is Vaishnav Upanishad you can check i am mentioning chapters etc. In adhyay (chapter) 2 rishis contemplate on who is the final god to which we may offer our greatest oblations, from 1 to 19 shloka they discuss about it, and in 21 st shloka they invoke agni and than they declare. Purushasya Vidmam Sahstraakshas Mahadevasya Dheemahi Tanno Rudrah Prachodayat. We desire to go towards Mahadev Rudra who is omnipotent having Thousands of eyes he is Greatest God of all Gods, our mind heart and intellect must always be with his divinity, bliss and Benevolence. Than again at anuvak 12 of this upanishads declares. Yo Devanam Prabhavashchodbhavashch Vishwadhipo Rudro Maharshih Hiranyagarbham janyamas Poorvam sano Budhya Shudhya sanyunaktu. We bow to the one who is sole master of universe who creates this universe all beings and Gods sustains them by his power and he merges them back in himself may such great lord bless us with divine bliss full intellect with devotion.Than from 19th anuvaak panch bramha mantras of shiva are given namely Sadyojat mantra, Vaamdev mantra, Tatpurush Mantra, Aghora Mantra, and Ishan mantra.I ts not only this upanishad but Shakta and other upanishads even of Gyan Yoga Shakha who worship formless form only also worship Shiva and consider him Greatest among all Gods. Gayatri rahsyopnishad says that the God or gayatri mantra is Sadashiva the goal of gayatri mantra is rudra only Devasya iteendro devo dyotat iti, sa indrastasmat sarvapurusho naam Rudrah. The God who is beyond senses and mind who is God and maker of all Gods, we know the Lord of this mantra as Sadashiva but none other. Again gyan shakhas Upanishad amritnadopnishad, the upnishads belonging to this shakha are never tilted towards any God, But they state truth of Gods as they witnessed and experienced them.Its first chapters second shloka Omkaar rath marumhya Vishnumkritvarth sarthimBramha loka padaanveshi Rudra raadhan tatparah Taking Omkar mantra as your chariot make shree Vishnu your Guru, the one who desires to achieve beyond Bramhaloka (immense bliss of shiva) must always worship Rudra with devotion and diligence. Now here are Upnisahds of Shiva, referring shlokas of these Upanishads is not necessary as they are totally devoted to Shiva Principle Tattva. Read any of them or all of them Shiva is everywhere, and even in Vaisnava, Shakta, Ganpatya, Sauree (sun worship) etc also consider Shiva as greatest God. Shivas Upnishads Of Rig Veda -: Nirvaan Upnishad, AtmaBodh Upnishad, Akshamalika Upnishad, NaadBindu Upnishad, Tripura Upnishad. SamVeda-: Kena Upnishad, Kundika Upanishad, RudrakshaJabal Upnishad, Jabal Upnishad, Yogachudamani Upnishad, Mah Upnishad. YajurVeda (Krishna)-: Amrit nada Upanishad, Amrit bindu Upanishad, Shwetashwatar Upanishad, Skanda Upanishad, Sarvasaar Upanishad, Akshi Upanishad, Avadhoota Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Kalagni Rudropanishad, Rudrahridaya Upanishad, Panchbramha Upanishad, Dakshinamurti Upanishad, Yogakundalini Upanishad, Shukarahasya Upanishad, Bramha vidya Upanishad. Yajurveda (Shukla)- Mantrikopnishad, Adyatma Upanishad, Jabaalopnishad, Turiyateeta Upanishad, AdvayaTaraka Upanishad, Paramhansa Upanishad.AtaharvaVeda- Parambramha Upanishad, Atharvashiras Upanishad, Atharvashikha Upanishad, Brihajjabal Upanishad, Sharabh Upanishad, Bhasmajabaali Upanishad, Pashupat Upanishad, Mandukya Upanishad,Mahavakya Upnishad. And there are around 21 unpublished Shaiwa Upanishads which i am not including.Now You can find Shiva in all of these Upanishads few of them are widely available in many translations. I can as said above write a fat book on Shiva in each Veda separately but as a write up or answer this is more than enough to establish that as Sun is the centre of our solar system, so is Shiva the greatest God among all as Vedas not said or sung but DECLARED. EKO HI RUDRO NA DWITEEYAY. Only Rudra is Lord of all Gods and existence, there not exists a second or equal To him, He is Lord of all (bramha vishnu and all gods) multiverses of this universe. (which is but tiny molecule in divine Body of Shiva).

Make a fire escape plan. If a fire breaks out in your home, you must flee as soon as possible. Prepare an escape plan with your family ahead of time. Make certain that everyone is aware of at least two unobstructed exits - including windows - from each room. (If you live in an apartment building, take the stairs rather than the elevator if you need to escape a fire.) Choose an outdoor meeting location. Make sure your entire family practises your escape plan at least twice a year. 3. Keep an eye out for smokers In North America, careless smoking is the leading cause of fire deaths. Smoking in bed or while drowsy can be fatal. Provide large, deep, non-tip ashtrays to smokers, and soak butts in water before discarding them. Check under cushions and around upholstered furniture for smouldering cigarettes before going to bed or leaving the house after someone has smoked. 4. Keep in mind that matches and lighters are only for adults! Use only child-resistant lighters and keep all matches and lighters up high, out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Teach children that matches and lighters are only for adults. Teach young children to notify an adult if they find matches or lighters; older children should immediately bring matches and lighters to an adult. 5. Kitchen safety Always stay close to the cooking to keep an eye on it. Cooking areas should be kept free of combustibles, and you should wear clothes with short, rolled-up, or tight-fitting sleeves. Turn pot handles inward on the stove so they don't get bumped and children don't grab them. Make a three-foot (one-meter) \\"kid-free\\" zone around your kitchen range.

Give space heaters space Portable and space heaters should be kept at least three feet (one metre) away from anything that can burn. Keep children and pets away from heaters, and turn them off before leaving the house or going to bed. 7. Use electricity safely If an electric appliance begins to smoke or emits an unusual odour, unplug it immediately and have it serviced before reusing it. Replace any cracked or frayed electrical cords. Only one electrical cord should be plugged into each receptacle. Cords should not be run under rugs. Don't tamper with your fuse box or use fuses that aren't the correct size. 8. Cool a burn For 10 to 15 minutes, run cool water over a burning object. Never use ice. Never use butter or any other type of grease to put out a fire. Consult a doctor right away if the burned skin blisters or becomes charred. 9. Crawl low under smoke If you encounter smoke while evacuating from a fire, take a different route. If you must flee through smoke, crawl on your hands and knees with your head 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 centimetres) above the floor, where the air is cleaner. 10.

If you’re at someone’s house and ask them to leave you alone and they say “this is my house, I have a right to be here”. Does that mean the Constitution has guaranteed their right to stay in that place? Of course not. The government can come and take their property at any time for any reason. Clearly, “right” means different things at different times to different people. Of course you don’t have a Constitutional human right to the free use of a doctor’s services, especially not if the doctor herself doesn’t want to offer them. But when people say “healthcare is a right”, that’s not what they mean. They mean everyone deserves access to healthcare regardless of ability to pay. Nobody is forcing doctors to work against their will, they just want a different process for paying them so that poor people aren’t dying and going bankrupt all the time with preventable and manageable illnesses and injuries. Many, many doctors support universal healthcare, so it’s obviously not backdoor slavery. It’s straightforward. Nobody is trying to change the definition of human rights. They should use different wording in their arguments because “healthcare is a right” appears to place it right alongside free speech in the philosophy of American government, and immediately turns off the people they are trying to convince. But we know what they’re trying to say, even if they word it in a way we disagree with. Try to look past the poor phrasing, and consider the actual policies they propose. Because you’d want the same courtesy from them regarding your own poorly phrased arguments on some other topic."},{"instruction":"Can a boxer intentionally fake a knockdown to recover and prevent themselves from getting knocked out?

The laws are there to prevent adults from exploiting children for their labor. Since children are dependent on adults, they can be persuaded to say they would prefer to work and give their money to their parents rather than go to school. I’m sure there are children who would want to help out their families. But there are thousands of families who would see their children’s labor as a simple solution to their poverty. The parents wouldn’t need to be evil. It’s just a simple solution to an immediate problem if a society doesn’t offer them better options.

Let me first recommend several good books on the subject. The third book is a good source of information about how the medieval Chinese mostly infantry army coped with horse-mounted northern Asian raids, incursions, and full-scale invasions. Roman Soldier vs Parthian Warrior. 2020. Si Sheppard. Osprey Publishing, Ltd., Great Britain.Rome’s Enemies 3, No. 175. Parthians and Sassanid Persians. Peter Wilcox and Angus McBride. 1986. Osprey, an imprint of Reed International Books, Ltd. London, Great Britain.Defending Heaven. China’s Mongol Wars 1209–1370. 2013. Frontline Books, an imprint of Pen & Sword Books, Ltd. S. Yorkshire, Great Britain. What ancient history lessons taught from the Roman-Parthian wars were these: a) It is better to extend the infantry’s line rather than form into a defensive square or circle. The latter surrenders all initiative and tactical maneuver to the horse-mounted opponent. Extending the line is better for preventing outflanking and being surrounded plus the infantry retains some element of defensive maneuver. At Carrhae, Crassus initially intended to extend his legions’ lines, according to the advice of his subordinate officers. But for reasons lost to history, he changed his mind and redeployed into a defensive circle or square. The attacking Parthian army of 10,000 light archer horsemen and 1,000 heavily armored cataphracts circled Crassus’ compacted army of 28,000 and shot them down at leisure all through the day. b) Marc Antony learned from Crassus’ mistakes. He brought along large numbers of slingers and archers to screen his legions and keep the Parthian mounted archers from closing in. A lead sling ball has twice the range of a stone sling ball and possesses deadly penetrative power, even against armored cataphracts. Antony also did not allow himself to get drawn into close battle on terrain suited for horsemen, that is, large, wide open, relatively flat ground with excellent visibility all around for miles. Antony did his best to stick to terrain that was unsuitable for a horse-mounted army and used rivers for transport as well as keeping his men supplied with water. Antony’s mistake was to split his force when advancing in haste. He left his siege train behind covered with what he thought was an adequate security force of two legions. The commander entrusted with the two legions should have posted adequate reconnaissance. The Parthians ambushed the siege train in force, scattered the two covering legions and seized the siege train, burning the catapults and ballistas. Without his siege train and already sustaining heavy losses, Antony retreated, keeping to rough terrain, fighting all the way back through Parthia and through treacherous Armenia to the safety of Roman territory. c) During the time of Diocletian the Roman Army introduced an auxiliary weapon for the legionary soldiers. This was the, ‘Plumbata’, also sometimes referred to as, ‘Martiobarbulus’. The plumbata was a dart about 12 inches or so long. One third of its length was a thin iron shaft tipped with a wicked, sharp, barbed point. The barbs were long and obviously intended to stick in flesh and extremely difficult to extract without a trained medic or surgeon’s skill. The remaining 2/3rds length was a wood shaft, thicker than the metal shaft and lined with three or four leather vanes, possibly of other materials, leaving about a one inch clear distance to the end so it could be gripped by the thumb and fingers. At the junction of the iron shank to the wood shaft, an oval lead weight connected the two together. The oval lead gave the plumbata its weight and thus throwing distance and penetrative power. Historians believe the legionary gripped the one-inch or so bottom portion of the dart and either tossed it high overhand or high underhand, like the old game of lawn darts, jarts, now a prohibited toy due to its danger. The idea was for thousands of legionaries to toss these plumbata darts high in the air to descend like a swarm of hornets onto onrushing horsemen. The darts were too small to possess real killing power but it did possess terrible wounding capability, sticking into the arms, bodies, and heads of the unarmored light archers, preventing them from using their recurve bows. If the dart struck the horse there was a chance the wounded horse would rear and throw its rider. The plumbata must have been effective because evidence points to its continued use for almost two centuries. The advantage was that the legionary could now defend himself against hostile horsemen and the legion did not have to rely on procuring large numbers of mercenary slingers and archers, not always available in the numbers needed plus the added expense of paying and supporting them. 4) Emperor Trajan is the one renown emperor who knew how to deal with the Parthian horse-mounted light archer army and the heavy armored cataphracts. Trajan also used terrain to his advantage, keeping away from open, flat terrain advantageous to horsemen. He used rivers and waterways for transport and logistics as much as possible. Historians believe Trajan used night attacks on the camping Parthians. Horses ridden during the day need to be fully rested at night. Nighttime was vulnerable for the Parthians. Trajan defeated the Parthians but not decisively. He briefly seized Parthia but almost immediately revolts broke out all over Parthia. Trajan’s legions were spread far too thin. Supplying them was a logistics nightmare. He also could not keep all of his legions permanently in Parthia. He needed to return some of the legions to guard the northern European frontier. Faced with reality, Trajan withdrew, giving up his Parthian conquest. After Trajan died, the Parthians would attempt a measure of revenge by a small counter invasion of Roman territory in the east, thinking that his successor, Antoninus Pius, would prove less capable. The Parthians were proved wrong and were later forced back into Parthia."},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

The problem I see runs something like this: I’m a man (for example). Therefore, everything I do is “manly”. or, to put it another way, everything I do is something man does. Just as everything every woman does is “feminine”, simply by virtue of the fact that she does it. It sounds ridiculous, but I think that our societal ideas about what makes males “men” and females “women” are a large part of why we’re seeing such a surge of mostly younger people deciding that they’re transgender, or non-binary, or whatever the term for gender dysphoric is this week. I think that as a society, it would probably do us good to reevaluate our gender roles- I can’t prove it, and could certainly be wrong, but I suspect that in a world where men were not expected to be physically strong, devoid of any emotion more complex than anger, sex-crazed and aesthetically retarded, women might feel freer to ignore pressures to act weaker, pretend to be incompetent, welcome their objectification as sex objects, and avoid logical thinking in favor of emotional over-wroughtness. If we could, if not eliminate, at least greatly reduce gender stereotyping in our culture, I think that we would quickly see a great reduction in the number of boys that think that they were meant to be girls, and vice versa. I realize this doesn’t answer the question posed by the questioner. I guess my answer is that the “manliest” thing I’ve seen done is whatever the last male person I saw was doing."},{"instruction":"Where do I find a local professional knitter?

This could cause the call to be placed on hold.Interference from other communication apps: If you are using another communication app like Skype or Zoom, it may be interfering with the WhatsApp call.Interference from VPN: If you are using a VPN, it may be interfering with the WhatsApp call, causing it to be placed on hold.The device's memory: if your device is running low on memory, this can cause the call to be put on hold. It's important to note that WhatsApp uses the internet to make and receive calls, so if your connection is poor or unstable, you may experience issues like dropped calls or poor call quality.

Is it during composition, after composition, or a combination of during and after?","output":"As a middle school student, my daughter was very fussy about the appearance of her assignments. They had to look…perfect. In her mind, “perfect” meant just like a magazine, with multiple columns, drop caps, text flowing around pictures and so on. Her teachers had things they wanted to see. The document had to be submitted in Word .doc or .docx format, with a certain font and size. And the document had to address each of the topics in the rubric, otherwise points would be deducted from her mark. Having tried to use Word for page layout, I foresaw problems. The time to do page layout is after the document had gone through many drafts concentrating on the words and pictures. Doing page layout while the text was still being edited meant continual fixing unfortunate page breaks, pictures on a different page from the text discussing them, and other gaps between “perfect” appearance and the current state of the document. As expected, tears were involved with each paper. She complained, why did Word make it so hard to look good? Every time, I helped her patch it up—only to spoil the moment by suggesting she delay page layout until after the document had gone through its last text review. Daughters can be quite stubborn when they have a clear idea of what the finished product should look like. Fortunately, she began deferring page layout after starting high school. The right way to format a document in Word is not to format it at all. Use the Styles feature instead. If you don’t like the appearance of something, edit the associated Style rather than applying individual format tweaks to each and every instance of something. I realize that making the Styles work for you is both more complex and time consuming than manually formatting. But you only have to edit those Styles once. For every other document you prepare using that template, you use the pre-edited Styles and the document looks consistent and perfect every time. “But I don’t use templates!” Well, that’s another problem. You are always using templates, even if it is only the Normal.dotm that you have been ignoring for years. If you want to create different kinds of documents (letters, memos, reports, etc.), each of them should use a different template so the new document inherits the previously edited Styles collection appropriate for that kind of document. Why fight Word by manually tweaking each instance of something? The more productive approach is to concentrate on the words and pictures, while using templates and Styles for all the formatting."},{"instruction":"any programmer ever been paid per line of code?","output":"If they did they were employed by idiots."},{"instruction":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","output":"The company had decided to fire a manager of the supply department.

Incidentally they’re still made that way today for the same reasons. It’s the only way you can unload troops or cargo from a boat onto the beach: You may have watched the movie Saving Private Ryan and seen this scene where German MGs fired directly into the boats: That scene isn’t very accurate. First of all those are American Higgins boats, while the actual landing on that part of Omaha was made with Royal Navy Landing Craft Assault (LCA) boats. They’re similar enough that it’s not a big deal though. The real issue is that the view from an actual German MG bunker on Omaha Beach looked like this: They actually fired sideways along the beach, not down it. Any German gun positions facing out to sea like they were in the movie would have got plastered by Allied warships before the troops even landed. Instead they couldn’t easily be seen from the sea and when the troops got off the boats the fire would have been coming from the side, not in front. In fact, in many places the bullets would have been coming from both sides at once, which is obviously bad. The front ramp on the LCA was in exactly the right place to do its job. The problem the troops had wasn’t the boats, it was that they were making an opposed landing against a well dug in enemy and they all got dropped in a confused mess on the wrong part of the beach with no armoured support. That’s a tough day at the office for anyone."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","output":"Sunday is the cheapest day of the week to check into a hotel.

Demand forecasting is predicting the demand for a specific product by taking into consideration customers' reactions and past trends. 4. Artificial intelligence (AI): AI makes it possible to deliver a personalized shopping experience at scale. 5. Mobile-first design: Mobile-first design is the process of creating websites that are customized for handheld devices with smaller screens. Instead of creating different versions of websites, the mobile-first design allows the same site to be viewed in a variety of formats. What do you think will be the trend in 2021?

Obviously if the headphones are tight, then this is nothing to do with their noise cancelling capabilities necessarily. The constant hissing sound from some headphones such as the Beats Studios 2.0 irritates me because it just sounds strange - completely subjective.

But the mistake we do is, running after complex questions. Online tests are designed that way so that students may get attracted towards any particular coaching center. So, your primary aim should be to practice your speed while giving mock. Don’t bother much about the marks.Short on confidence/lack of goal - If you want to prepare for GATE, first ask yourself whether that is what you really want. I have seen a lot of people leaving their preparations mid-way. That will do nothing good to you. So, it’s better that if you are boarding a ship, you sail it till the end. Also, be confident. Don’t let your past results affect your current preparation.Syllabus - You know the exact syllabus. Prepare your strategy so that you don’t miss out in any subject. If you have joined any particular coaching classes, it will take care of that. Otherwise, chart out the syllabus and prepare systematically. IF you are finding any particular topic difficult, leave that topic and move on. Don’t bother wasting time.Lack of discipline - Dedicate a fix amount of time. Make short goals according to syllabus and keep a track of it. If you are not able to do that, better join some coaching class.Over doing the preparation - Trust me, this happens. Once we are done with the syllabus, say, 4 months before the exam, we get bored and deviate our attention towards unwanted questions and syllabus. It’s better to start at right time and end it accordingly.Comparison - Stop comparing yourself with other students. Be positive and work on your own plan. Never get depressed by comparing your preparation with someone else. I will add more, when I remember.

Even the ones who are pursuing it and making an impact in the industry were doubtful in the initial stages of their journey. So, what is a good way to get started. I would say it starts with first figuring out - What specialisation of dance would you like to explore in the beginning, if you have an inclination for any particular field or if you are skilled in one. Else, start with the foundational courses and explore what resonates best with you. For the foundation, you can begin with exploring some academies such as shiamak davar’s, terence lewis’ , The danceworx (TDx), etc. Self-evaluate yourself each time you come out of any class as that’s what would keep you going and growing each day. Besides, you can be a professional dancer, choreographer, dance coach, or even a dance teacher. Opportunities are immense. All you need is the right mentoring to excel. Marrying your passion with the right wisdom is necessary to stay ahead. So, have some mentors from the start. My instagram page (id - edgenus_001) seeks to feature experts and achievers in the field of dance who have holistically provide the spectrum of ideas, as they come from different backgrounds.

Let me tell the amateur users of IMDb that the aggregate rating of 1–10 rating is not important as much it is important to check the number of votes/ratings. That aggregate pointer can go up or down at any moment on the basis of various factors not publicly revealed by IMDb yet. And according to the highest rated movie this way, a movie named Masaab from 2017 is the winner in India? But guess what, it has only 5 number of votes. So as you see, this is quite flawed. But Dil Bechara manages to be in number two position according to this sorting, which can still change any minute. Now let's compare it with the most voted Indian film - 3 Idiots from 2009. This movie has a whopping 329,305 number of votes, & counting. And based on this many count of votes, & being prone to an immense potential number of both positive & negative votes, the movie has still managed to maintain a 8.4 pointer rating. So according to this, 3 Idiots is still the highest rated Indian movie on IMDb with the most number of votes. And this system of sorting is more reliable & irreversible when it comes to judging the quality of movies. But does that mean, Dil Bechara did not break any records on IMDb? Not true. It did in fact break the biggest record in India. Up until now, there were only 6 movies, all of Aamir Khan's, & largely because of the interest from international audience & as a result of being listed in the Top 250 list, that have had a number of ratings above 100,000, slowly gathered over time. And out of the 14,000+ (Hindi only) movie titles on IMDb, only 20 in total have a rating above 60,000 votes, which itself is a rare thing. Compare that with 1800+ out of 442,000+ total movie titles that have a rating above 100,000, fortunately all ranging from 5–10 pointer ratings, but 98% of those movies are English. Now most of those ratings, in the case of Indian movies, are either gathered over time, or were increased after the movies were released in international markets. So you can see, Indian audience was not the most active market for IMDb. Because it's common for English movies to reach the mark of 100,000 easily if there is buzz, & even more easy if the movie is a big budget film. Even English movies released on Netflix are known to make such marks, sometimes within days. But everything has changed in the Indian scene since Dil Bechara released on Hotstar (free to watch title in India for the time being). For the records, it's the first movie to reach an unprecedented mark of 50,000 votes within just 24 hours. It is the first Indian movie to maintain a rating point above 9 even after being subject to a high number of votes. In fact, the numbers are increasing so rapidly that it just might be the fastest Indian movie to reach the mark of 100,000+ votes within just days, & still be able to maintain a rating above 9, which is itself a rare feat, even for an English movie. So, you see Dil Bechara broke the records on IMDb, just not in the way you thought, but in fact, in a much more exclusive & exemplary way. This shows that, if there is enough love & motivation, even Indians can promote good Indian movies with high ratings, & create international buzz & bring attention to the art of our country, & remove the stigma attached to the craft of our country. We, being the second largest movie makers by revenue & the first by number, never managed to break such international records before. Vote brigading or not, let's not stop here, especially for great movies. If Americans can do it, we can do it too. And by the way, Dil Bechara has managed to break records on YouTube too. First, it became the most liked trailer in the world, beating the record of even mammoths like Avengers Endgame. Avengers Endgame (3M likes ratio to a viewership of 136M). Dil Bechara (10M likes ratio to a viewership of a common 81M). Even the songs broke many records in India. Such is the tribute & love for the late star, Sushant Singh Rajput. This is truly rare & unprecedented, even compared to some of the biggest names in the past. It's truly awe-inspiring to see this happen. Let's maintain this josh in the future too."},{"instruction":"What do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of teaching with technologies?","output":"The main advantages of teaching with technologies are that it promotes learning, enables the students to be more engaged and focused, and helps them to be more active during the class. These three things are what make me think that teaching with technology is a better alternative than teaching without it. If you ask me though, the main disadvantages of teaching with technologies are that they can be distracting for the students. If a student is not paying attention, they may get distracted by the device and their focus will be broken. Another disadvantage would be that teachers have to change their way of teaching because of the new technology. For example, if you have been using slides for your presentation and now you have an app for it, you might have to make some adjustments so that everything still looks like it did before but now does not require that much effort from your part since everything is already done for you!"},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave? In a manner of speaking. As a couple of other people have noted, having good tenants is worth far, far more than a couple hundred bucks a month. I own my own home now, but when I last rented my landlord only raised the rent when her own costs went up. Hey, costs go up. It happens. But she didn’t take the opportunity to do an additional markup. Made us want to stay, and made us want to keep her liking us. Contrast this to the consequences of what happened to our landlord before that. My wife and I were excellent tenants. We paid on time every month, and in the 2 years that we lived there, we called upon them a total of 2 times. We took care of the place as good - or better - than if it were out own. At the 60-day-before-the-renewal date (as required by state law), I got a letter saying that they were going to raise the rent by around 20%. This wound up being another 500/mo. I don’t know about you, but an extra 500/month is not trivial to me. I certainly didn’t get a 500/month raise from work. So, naturally, I wanted to know 1) what was the reason, and 2) what we might be ‘getting’ as a result of the higher price. I was actually afraid for a moment that, somehow, we had offended or done something to anger the landlords. I genuinely was concerned that they were holding something against us about which we did not know. Instead, she told me that there was no other reason to raising the rent, other than the fact that she thought she could get it. She thought that she was losing money that she could have been getting. Reminds me of Aesop’s Fables: [LINKED_TEXT: The Dog and Its Reflection - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_and_Its_Reflection] Mind you, in the 2 years we had lived there, we had not cost her a single penny. She was, effectively, getting more than her mortgage cost, complete with a healthy profit. As to the second question, no, there would be no other benefits to living in their house. I couldn’t really understand it. The logic was truly weird to me: Even if she managed to find other tenants right away, she would still need to clean and prep the house - which takes about a month. So, that was 2500 out of her pocket (or, to put it into perspective, 5 months of the additional rent that she wanted). If she couldn’t get it occupied right away, she could have eaten away an entire year of that additional profit in less than 3 months. In other words, in the best case scenario, she wouldn’t see a dime of additional money until the 6th month of getting rent. Nevertheless, there was no benefit for us staying, so, we told her that we would be moving. She was absolutely shocked. Sure enough, we set about trying to find another place, and found an even better location, with a better house, with better landlords, for a better place. Sometimes the stars actually do align. Nevertheless, since the house was still on my way to work, I could see that the house remained unoccupied for about 2.5 months (the math is left up as an exercise to the reader as to how much it cost her). I’m a big believer that life provides its own epilogues. Unfortunately, USPS wasn’t all that great in remembering that we had moved, so I had to go back to the house about 3 months after we moved, in order to find and retrieve a parcel that was supposed to come to me. The new tenants (3 college fraternity brothers), invited me into the house while they went and searched for my package. They had been in the house for about, oh, 2 to 3 weeks. The house was trashed. In less than a month, they had punched holes in the walls, stained the beautiful off-white carpets, chipped the stonework around the fireplace, and cracked the kitchen tile. I’m no contractor, but if I had to hazard a guess, they probably made close to 10k in damage to be brought back to full repair. In less than a month. We had gotten 100% of our deposit back. There was no way the deposit for these guys was going to begin to cover the damage that they had already done. As I stood in the kitchen, all I could think about was how this was going to need a lawsuit to resolve. (Note: this had been my home for 2 years. I’m not going to lie - for all the work that my wife and I did, all the care and protection for the house, to be destroyed so wantonly… well, it was sad. It was almost as if we shouldn’t have bothered, except those aren’t the kind of people we are. I couldn’t help but feel like these guys had not just trashed the landlord’s home, but mine as well. I didn’t say anything, though, as I didn’t feel it was my place.) Ultimately, she not only lost the money that she would have received for that 2.5 months (let’s say it was over 6000 of rent, to make the numbers easy), but then had to suffer the issues and indignities related to paying for repair of her house. What’s even sadder is that it was her late father’s house, not just an investment, and she held an emotional bond with it herself. There is something to be said about priorities, not to mention risks and costs. So, a little off topic from the original question, perhaps, but a cautionary tale nevertheless. Thing is, if she had only marginally increased the rent, we probably would have stayed. Given how callously she regarded our value, however, that would not likely have been in our best interest. We could have probably been like this guy: [LINKED_TEXT: Boiling frog - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog] So, a tip to renters: know your value. Always keep an eye on the market, have areas to which you can move if you wind up in a situation where the landlord wishes to bump up your rent unreasonably. Many, many landlords are aware of just how valuable good renters are, and will bend over backwards to keep them. Obviously, not all of them are. But make sure that you are exchanging that value fairly, and be ready to walk when they aren’t."},{"instruction":"What is it like being a farmer?

I am missing my Mom , So i would describe her day .

It is a complex process that involves a number of factors, including the following: Timeliness: Newsworthiness is often determined by how timely a story is. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are happening right now or that have just happened.Impact: Newsworthiness is also determined by the impact a story is likely to have. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are likely to affect a large number of people or that are likely to have a significant impact on the world.Interest: Newsworthiness is also determined by the interest of the audience. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that are likely to interest their readers or viewers.Conflict: Newsworthiness is also often determined by conflict. News organizations are more likely to cover stories that involve conflict, such as wars, natural disasters, or political scandals. News gathering and processing in print and broadcast journalism are both challenging and rewarding. There are a number of opportunities and obstacles that journalists face in both mediums. Opportunities: Speed: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to report on news quickly. This is especially true for broadcast journalists, who can use television and radio to reach a large audience in real time.Reach: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to reach a large audience. This is because print newspapers and broadcast news programs are available to people all over the world.Impact: Print and broadcast journalists have the opportunity to have a significant impact on the world. This is because they can report on stories that can inform and educate the public and that can lead to positive change. Obstacles: Cost: Print and broadcast journalism can be expensive. This is because it requires the purchase of equipment, the hiring of staff, and the production of content.Time constraints: Print and broadcast journalists are often under time constraints. This is because they need to report on news quickly and efficiently.Bias: Print and broadcast journalists can be biased in their reporting. This is because they are human and they can be influenced by their own personal opinions and beliefs. Despite the challenges, print and broadcast journalism are still important mediums for news gathering and processing. They provide a vital service to the public by keeping them informed about current events. In addition to the opportunities and obstacles mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can influence the news judgment of journalists. These include the following: The editorial policies of the news organization: Each news organization has its own editorial policies, which dictate what stories are considered newsworthy. These policies can vary from organization to organization.The personal biases of the journalist: Journalists are human beings, and they have their own personal biases. These biases can sometimes influence the stories that they choose to report on.The pressure to publish: Journalists are often under pressure to publish stories quickly, which can sometimes lead to mistakes.The availability of information: Journalists are only able to report on stories that they have information about. If they do not have enough information about a story, they may not be able to report on it. News judgment is a complex process that is influenced by a number of factors. It is important for journalists to be aware of these factors and to be transparent about their news judgment."},{"instruction":"there a reason, other than cost, to not use GFCI outlets in all outlets, rather than just kitchen and bath?","output":"One reason is the NEC doesn't require them everywhere.

One of my friends recommends IG Career Institute in Kolkata-700118. I was not aware of IG Career Institute at that time. So I talked with them about the class and my friends started taking the class. The class was very good and my friends were highly satisfied. Online class was taken by the best faculties. Every class is well planned. IG Career Institute also provides pre-recorded video classes as a backup. After every class 1:5, teacher-student interaction removes any doubt regarding a topic that discusses in that class. IG Career Institute provides online test series for weekly module tests, Full tests, etc which is very helpful for students.

I don’t believe most gun control works; universal background checks, one gun a month, waiting a week or 10 days, banning semi-auto rifles, limiting magazine size to lower than standard capacities, safe storage penalties. I don’t think it does much. What happens after this has been enforced for a few years and a crazy person shoots up the place or gun violence doesn’t fall through the floor. The Gun Safety people are going to have to latch onto some other gimmick, and that gimmick is going to be some sort of gun ban. All the policies I mentioned above will limit or dimish legal domestic gun ownership. I’ve lived in two states that border each other, Virginia and Maryland. Maryland has had some of the strictest gun control in the nation for years, Virginia has had little gun control. It is so painful for a person to buy a gun in Maryland, some don’t You need to get a background check, fill out a form, take a class, wait for your MDHQL (License) to arrive, then take your license and go buy your gun, You then wait 7 business days after filling out both state and federal forms, and getting charged , the same background check used to get your MDHQL is re-run by the gun store. 7 business days later your drive back to the gun shop and pick up your gun. In Virginia, you fill out a form, they run the same background check Maryland does, and give you the gun, usually within an hour. The moral of the story is that Maryland has made the act of purchasing a firearm so difficult some people don’t bother. Worse, with Virginia having almost no gun control except for the background check you’d think blood would be running in the streets, apparently not.

Also, it's equally budget-friendly! especially if you use WordPress to do it. Did you know that almost one-third of all websites are powered by WordPress? If you've never built a website before, don't worry. I'll walk you through the procedure in this short article, and it'll go very smoothly. Step 1: Choose a hosting Provider. An important choice for the well-being of your website or blog is selecting a hosting provider. It can determine whether or not your website will be fast, secure, and always accessible. You should base your choice on the following main points of view: Hosting service for WordPress was optimized for it: Make sure the hosting plan you select is ideal for WordPress if you intend to build your website with this platform. It will ensure that features like 1-click WordPress installation, automatic updates, uptime tracking plugins, and more are available. Speed of hosting: Your website or blog should load quickly so that visitors don't have to wait. For the best performance, look for the most recent technologies, such as SSDs, the most recent PHP version, and pre-installed [LINKED_TEXT: LiteSpeed cache plugins.] [URL: https://www.litespeedtech.com/] Price of hosting: Because there is so much competition in the market, you don't have to choose the most expensive provider to get the best hosting. [LINKED_TEXT: WordPress hosting plans are available from Hostinger for just 1,99 per month.] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] Hosting uptime of 99,99%: If you want your website to be up and running constantly, this step is crucial. Check the status reports and other signs to see if the hosting company keeps its promise. Excellent customer support: This step is most important to beginners, but even if you are a professional, customer support may be able to assist you in resolving some more challenging problems. Ensure that they have a WordPress-focused team. Step 2. Choose a domain name. The domain name is the name of your website, You can find the domain name in the search bar. For a domain name, you can be creative and use any word you like, but it works best if you use a word or a word combination that is closely related to the name of your blog or company. Make sure it's short and memorable so that visitors to your website can easily remember it. Here are some of the top website or blog name generators in case you're stuck for guidance. You are free to choose any domain name extension you like. However, .com, .net, and [LINKED_TEXT: .org] [URL: http://and.org/] are the most widely used extensions. Typically, domain names cost 10–15 per year. I advise getting a domain name along with your hosting package so you might [LINKED_TEXT: get one for free for a year!] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] Step3- Install WordPress You can install WordPress and begin editing your blog once you've arranged for a domain name and hosting package. Remember to complete all the required fields in your hosting and domain accounts. If you don't register the domain name immediately after purchasing it, otherwise, someone else might get it first. Once you're finished, you can quickly install WordPress in your hosting dashboard with a single click. Step 4-Pick a WordPress theme You can save yourself some valuable time by using a WordPress theme, which will have the entire website and design planned out for you. Customizing it will be the only thing you need to do. Before beginning anything, some people try to choose the best theme for hours or even days. Don't overthink your choice; you just need something simple to get going. I recommend selecting something helpful but not overwhelming. Don't be afraid to experiment because you won't know what your visitors will like before they visit your website. Try the [LINKED_TEXT: OceanWP theme] [URL: https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/] if you're having trouble finding something that works for your needs. Both a blog and a personal website can use this trendy and useful theme. Here is a [LINKED_TEXT: comprehensive list] [URL: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/best-wordpress-blog-themes] of the best WordPress themes, both paid and unpaid, in case that isn't to your taste. With WordPress, changing or installing a theme is very simple. Just log in and go to the appearance section, themes, and add new. Step 5: Customize your website unique. One of the most exciting aspects of building a website is by far customizing your blog or website. You can add all the necessary components and pages, change the layout, and add a menu bar. Some themes may not even need customizations; all you need to do is install a specific plugin to get everything you want. You can also begin to (or continue to) design your website. It's a good idea if you have specific ideas for how your website should look, it's a good time for implementing them. Step-6. Add the content. Once everything is set up, you can begin adding your original content to your website. You can include pictures, textual descriptions, blog posts, or anything else you like. Your writing should be highly appealing and audience-specific. I am aware that perfecting it takes time, but it is completely worthwhile. Make your content different from the rest since there is already a lot available. Step 7- Optimize your website It's time to optimize your website once you're done with the setup. Running a test through [LINKED_TEXT: GTmetrix ] [URL: https://gtmetrix.com/]as a starting point will show you what needs to be improved. You can do a few simple things, such as: optimizing the images on your websites;enabling caching;minimizing the size of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Bonus advice Don't forget to [LINKED_TEXT: install an SSL certificate] [URL: https://www.hostg.xyz/SHCi8] on your domain before publishing your website. Within your hosting panel, you can do that.

Most Bernie Sanders supporters, including myself, were of a mind that he’d bring these to pass if it was at all in his power to do so. We supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton precisely because she does not have his track record for making left-swinging changes. I’m satisfied that HRC won’t swing the country to the right (which I feel would be a mistake right now, we’re already extremely right-wing on the political spectrum internationally), but I don’t think she’s going to swing it much to the left, either. She will be a good and competent administrator. I think her presidency will be remembered as a time when everyone just kinda chilled the f*ck out. She also has a long political history and will be able to more effectively reach across the aisle, so to speak. I expect she’ll be able to break up the deadlock a bit. Things should settle down and settle in. It’ll be boring, but productive and, in general, a time of national healing after some turbulence (that made us better)."},{"instruction":"Are NRA members proud that legally owned guns are used in school mass shootings?","output":"No legally owned gun has been used to commit a school shooting.

It is a prosecutorial document. As such, it contains or presents one side. If prosecutorial documents were considered to represent the full truth, then there is no need for an accused to receive a trial and other due process. In both our legal system and in critical thinking, full truth requires investigation and exposition of more than one side. Thus observe that in the investigation and the Report that witnesses were not cross-examined by adversary council - that is adversary to the DOJ questioners and their agenda. There is almost 100% certainty that exculpatory evidence exists that is not included the Report. There are no competing theories presented or argued to account for alleged action or motives of those involved, nor additional evidence presented to support those theories. Thus, even if every alleged and so-called fact in the Report is verifiable and correct, that in no way or in any imaginable scenario means the Mueller Report contains or represents the full truth. To reach this obvious conclusion it is irrelevant which side of the political isle or argument one is on. Moreover, many of the legal and evidentiary conclusions being promulgated by many of the Democrats in Congress and elsewhere are therefore utterly preposterous and unfounded - and as such merely represent their further continued descent into depraved disregard for the principles of Anglo-American due process in pursuit of their political agenda."},{"instruction":"Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?","output":"Lost the plot, in denial, dismissive of reality and totally out of touch."},{"instruction":"Why don’t carbon monoxide detectors alert to natural gas leaks, when gas leaks can cause carbon monoxide poisoning?","output":"Natural gas leaks don’t cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

People have been breeding large dogs for centuries, and there are many breeds that are considered large. However, compared to some of the largest wild cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, these dogs are not considered to be “big” in the same way. This begs the question, why are there no big dogs? To answer this, it is important to look at the evolutionary history of both cats and dogs. Cats and dogs both evolved from ancient carnivorous mammals. Cats evolved from the Felidae family, while dogs evolved from the Canidae family. Though they share similarities, cats and dogs have distinct differences in their evolutionary history and development. Cats are considered to be apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This led to the development of cats being solitary hunters and having a natural instinct to protect themselves from danger. Cats also evolved to have longer bodies, larger heads, and powerful claws for hunting prey. Their agility, strength, and stealth are unmatched in the animal kingdom. This allowed cats to evolve into larger species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, to better hunt their prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a pack-based hunter and scavenger lifestyle. Dogs’ survival depended on their ability to work together in a group and hunt or scavenge whatever food they could find. This led to the development of dogs having shorter bodies, smaller heads, and weaker claws for scavenging. Dogs are not considered to be apex predators, and therefore have not evolved into larger species like cats have. In addition, the domestication of dogs has also played a role in the lack of large dogs. Cats were domesticated much later than dogs, and their domestication has not altered their natural predatory instincts as much as it has with dogs. Dogs, on the other hand, have been domesticated for thousands of years and have developed a close relationship with humans. This has led to the selective breeding of dogs to be smaller and less aggressive, and has eliminated any natural instinct to survive without human help. The combination of evolutionary history and domestication has led to the lack of large breeds of dogs. Cats were able to evolve into larger species due to their natural predatory instincts, while dogs were bred to be smaller and less aggressive due to their domestication. Therefore, when it comes to large or “big” dogs, there are simply none that exist today. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

However, here are some contributing factors that are often cited: 1. Social media: The rise of social media has made it easier for individuals to compare themselves to others and feel a sense of inadequacy. Constant exposure to social media can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. 2. High-pressure environment: Today's society places a high value on academic and professional success, resulting in an increased workload and pressure to achieve. This can lead to burnout, stress, and depression. 3. Financial instability: Economic instability can contribute to a sense of hopelessness and increased levels of anxiety and depression, especially for young adults entering the workforce. 4. Lack of social support: With the shift towards an individualistic society, social support structures have weakened. This can result in feelings of isolation, which can increase the risk of depression. 5. Trauma: People in this generation experience a range of traumatic events, from exposure to violence and conflict to increased natural disasters. This can have long-term effects on mental health."},{"instruction":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

While they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Composition: Granite is an igneous rock composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that forms from limestone under high pressure and heat. Hardness: Granite is harder than marble and is therefore more durable and less likely to scratch or chip. Marble is softer and more susceptible to damage. Appearance: Granite typically has a speckled or granular appearance, with a range of colors from light to dark. Marble has a more veined appearance, with swirling patterns in a variety of colors. Maintenance: Granite is relatively low maintenance and requires only regular cleaning with a mild detergent. Marble, however, is more prone to staining and requires more careful cleaning and maintenance. Cost: Granite is generally less expensive than marble, though the cost can vary depending on the quality and rarity of the stone. Overall, the choice between granite and marble depends on personal preference, budget, and the intended use of the stone. Granite is a good choice for high-traffic areas such as kitchen countertops, while marble is often used for decorative purposes such as flooring or sculptures."},{"instruction":"What is the worst service experience from a five star hotel?","output":"The worst service experience I ever had from a five star hotel was when I stayed at one in the Caribbean.

It's important to nourish your body with a variety of delicious and healthy foods. Fill your plate with colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like chicken or fish, and whole grains such as brown rice or quinoa. These choices provide essential nutrients and can help keep your blood sugar stable.Remember that portion control plays a significant role. It's not about depriving yourself but rather enjoying your favorite foods in moderation. By paying attention to portion sizes, you can savor the flavors you love while keeping your blood sugar levels in check.I encourage you to explore low glycemic index (GI) foods. These include foods like sweet potatoes, lentils, and leafy greens. They are digested more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar instead of sudden spikes. Incorporating these foods into your meals can help you maintain more stable blood sugar levels throughout the day.Let's make a conscious effort to reduce sugary beverages in your routine. Swap out sodas or sugary juices for refreshing options like infused water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water with a slice of lemon or cucumber. By cutting back on sugary drinks, you can better manage your blood sugar and promote overall health.Fiber is your friend when it comes to blood sugar control. Incorporate high-fiber foods into your diet, such as whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes. Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, helping to prevent sharp spikes and maintaining a more balanced blood sugar level.Let's get moving! Regular physical activity not only helps manage blood sugar levels but also improves your overall well-being. Find activities you enjoy, whether it's taking a brisk walk, dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, and remember to include strength training exercises to keep your body strong.Managing stress is an essential part of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Find activities that help you relax and unwind, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy. Taking care of your mental and emotional well-being can positively impact your blood sugar control.Prioritize a good night's sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Lack of sleep can disrupt your body's insulin sensitivity and affect your blood sugar levels. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine and create a comfortable sleep environment to promote restful sleep.If you have diabetes, closely monitoring your carbohydrate intake can be beneficial. Work with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, who can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrates to include in your meals and snacks.Lastly, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding medications and treatments for blood sugar control. They are there to support you and provide guidance specific to your needs. Personal recommendation : [LINKED_TEXT: Ground-breaking Blood Sugar and Sleep Support] [URL: https://0e8757q76vfva5ufmhsbwg3-46.hop.clickbank.net/] Remember, you're not alone on this journey.

Be creative - If the obvious approach to solving a problem isn’t working, look for alternate, even unusual or creative approaches. 4. Bite off more than you can chew (within reason). Be prepared to tackle the hard tasks. Don’t be afraid to enlist the advice and help of others around the organisation - usually your friends and colleagues want you to succeed. 5. Be humble. Don’t make a big deal of your accomplishments, let them speak for themselves. 6. Build your network. The more relationships you have with subject matter experts and people of influence, and in senior positions, the greater your own influence and effectiveness becomes. 7. Be patient. You will achieve strong advancement if you follow these principles, but not in a week or a month - you need to apply yourself over time and you will be recognised. 8. Don’t burn bridges. If you take a flame thrower to bridges when solving problems, you’ll end up staring blankly at large canyons, longing for the other side. 9. Build your skills.

If you are orbiting the Earth at 250 miles up, traveling at 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h), and you throw a baseball toward the Earth, what will happen to the baseball? 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h) is the speed you must travel at 250 miles up to maintain an orbit around Earth. An average person can throw a baseball at approximately [LINKED_TEXT: 25 miles per hour] [URL: https://www.cgaa.org/articles/how-fast-can-an-average-person-throw-a-baseball]. However, different people have different throwing speeds. Since Earth is the target and it’s 250 miles away, it would take an object 600 minutes, or 10 hours to travel 250 miles. Meanwhile, every 90 minutes, the baseball will completely orbit the Earth, miss the Earth, and go around for another try. Essentially, the baseball will enter into an elliptical orbit around Earth and never hit the ground until the very thin atmosphere at 250 miles altitude slows the baseball enough that it de-orbits and enters the atmosphere, and this could take many months. The reason the baseball never reaches the Earth is that the baseball still has a forward velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the Earth's gravity, and as a result, it will follow a curved path around the planet. Let’s say you’re an astronaut who is the best baseball pitcher in the world. Assuming that you are traveling at 17,500 mph relative to the Earth when you throw the baseball, and the baseball is thrown in the opposite direction to the spacecraft's forward momentum at a velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the astronaut, the baseball's velocity relative to the Earth would be zero. In this case, the baseball would not have any forward velocity relative to the Earth, and it would fall towards the planet due to the force of gravity. The baseball would likely burn up in the Earth's atmosphere during re-entry, but it would not remain in orbit around the Earth."},{"instruction":"Do you believe the claim that Gavin Menzies makes in his book “1421: The Year China Discovered America” that Admiral Zheng voyaged to the Americas before European explorers?","output":"Well, ther is this: [LINKED_TEXT: NEW STUDY OF ANCHOR STONES REBUTS CHINA ORIGIN THEORY (Published 1982)A California historian has challenged a theory that stone anchors found off the coast of California were dropped by ships carrying explorers from China years before Columbus discovered America.

Soldiers used to frequently take artifacts from the enemy and use them in battle or even keep them as mementos. Small weapons, flags, and other significant personal items are examples of such items. We want to know if this practice is still being used today. Do soldiers thus take enemy weapons? Even when they are running low on ammunition, most soldiers stay away from hostile weaponry. They run the danger of not knowing if the opposition is using it as an offensive tactic. Similarly to this, if a soldier is untrained in using an enemy weapon, there may be little sense in picking it up. Therefore, the army discourages its service members from considering the employment of enemy weaponry for safety grounds in order to protect their soldiers. In this article, we examine military tactics to see if combat medals are becoming obsolete. Are soldiers permitted to use enemy weaponry when engaged in combat? Can they keep them as mementos and what are the rules? You can learn the answers to these and other questions by reading on. Can Soldiers Pick Up Enemy Weapons? In some situations, a soldier's final resort can be to take an enemy weapon in hand. Other times, such as in guerilla warfare, the situation is so critical that the soldier's ammunition choice is the last thing on his or her mind. Depending on how conventional the army is and it's fighting regulations, different laws apply in this circumstance. One of the rules in this situation is that the soldier may take whatever appropriate action as long as it doesn't jeopardize the security of their squad. However, these regulations are set by the Special Forces and the relevant fighting units. In conflict, it's generally not a good idea for soldiers to use the enemy's weapons, and some strict warriors won't even think about it when they're out of ammunition. Some people even believe that leaving a weapon that can be used around for their adversary to find and use against them is a sign of weakness. Similar to this, what good is taking up a weapon if it can only be used by the correct hands? Find out why it's not a smart idea to use your opponent's weapon. Level of Training Before engaging in combat, every soldier goes through specialized training that is tailored specifically to the kind of weapon they will employ. Consequently, it is useless for them to pick up a weapon for which they have no training. If they use it in any other way, it might seriously harm them or their fellow soldiers. Since many soldiers have died from these weapons because they were used incorrectly, it is recommended to stay away from opposing weapons. In addition, several weapons self-destruct if a foreigner attempts to use them. For instance, a soldier might take out the bolt, reveal the pin, insert it into the hole, and then snap it off to completely incapacitate the gun for the subsequent user. Sabotage Tactics The battlefield can be fairly challenging because you never know what strategy your adversary will use to corner you. First, the opposing side might grab their weapons and sabotage or rig them; as a result, the weapon might malfunction or blow up when it is fired. In addition to jamming adjacent weapons, this tampered ammunition may also render your troops defenseless. One approach to sneak into the enemy's camp is to leave modified weapons lying around. Therefore, the majority of soldiers choose to employ their own artillery. Friendly Fire Some firearms may sound the same when fired, as you may have noticed. For instance, the M-4 and AK-47 both have similar sounds. A soldier should therefore stick to their own weapon if both sides are using these weapons. If not, they might be making themselves a target for both sides, which would be a self-defeating strategy. Safety Before deciding to take an enemy's weapon, safety must come first. Every soldier is aware that there are a few things to take into account before approving a firearm for usage. They must be able to disassemble, clean, and reassemble it. By doing this, you can be sure that the gun is secure and hasn't been rigged or booby-trapped. In addition, the soldier's gun is probably in the crossfire given that they are down. As a result, if it is also struck, it could be destroyed or have its barrel twisted, which would affect the shot's accuracy. Such a weapon is dangerous to anyone utilizing it because it has a high risk of exploding, especially under back pressure. Can Soldiers Keep Captured Weapons? Which nation a soldier is fighting for determines whether they are allowed to keep the weapons they have taken. Countries like the US have severe laws that ban soldiers from keeping guns they have taken and compel them to return any weapons they have taken to their unit. Weapons and personal belongings are among the goods that are kept as a tradition in armed conflict. The successful side or the battle hero benefited from this tactic. It was a display of bravery and a blatant sign of the victorious side in the conflict. The soldiers may still value this highly; hence, they may want to keep enemy weaponry as mementos. But is it permitted by law? Generally speaking, different nations and combat units have their own laws regarding the retention of looted enemy property. When a team seizes a weapon, it may be treated as a war prize in some nations. After labeling them, the appropriate authorities seize them and put them on display. Each firearm receives a designation based on the method of capture. Heavy armament, such as trucks, ships, and airplanes, are subject to this practice. For smaller ammunition, such as rifles and pistols, however, they take them and put them on exhibit in other institutions. However, according to US practice, any time a soldier finds an enemy weapon, they must give it back to their squad. It will be properly disposed of by the parties involved; they will either destroy it or render it inoperable. They break the receiver and remove the bolt from small-caliber weapons like pistols and firearms, rendering the weapon utterly worthless. Larger weapons are destroyed by explosions or airstrikes if they are there. Their primary worry is that the adversary might find them again and use the weapons against them. If they are destroyed, the enemy cannot take them back. The legislation is fairly strict in forbidding soldiers from seizing and keeping enemy weaponry, either for use or as a memento. The best course of action is to declare that you are in possession of it and then provide it to the appropriate persons for disposal. The idea is that since a soldier fights for their country, anything he acquires or captures during the conflict belongs to it. The leaders of the unit will choose the next course of action with regard to the weapons, captives, or the land. If a soldier still chooses to keep enemy weapons, it would be against the law and punishable. They can only keep such a weapon by keeping it illegally, which is strongly advised against. Finally The wisest course of action would be to refrain from picking up or using any enemy weapons at all; yet, some soldiers believe it to be an essential action in battle. Many veterans of past wars, such as the world War, admit to picking up enemy ammunition during altercations. They even claim that it was a smart approach that might have helped them win the battles. Due to their scarcity, it was necessary to seize these weapons, which also increased their ammunition supply. However, if the army is organized and well-supplied, its own artillery will be sufficient. The US Constitution forbids the storage of firearms belonging to enemies. It is therefore advisable to stay away from it; else, soldiers will be doing If you liked the answer Upvote and Follow"},{"instruction":"What are the most underrated cities in the U.S.?","output":"Underrated?

Setting up your goals is very important because it keeps you on track every time you reminisce about your writing journey. Be Yourself Each and every writer has his or her own fingerprint when they write and you should not try to write as someone else. Always keep in mind that what works for you is different from what works for your role model. Try finding your own writing method using your instinct as your guiding compass and with time your mind will create a universe just for you where you can create whatever you want. Make Mistakes This might sound like bad advice but it is not. Great writers also made mistakes but it is just that no one mentions them.

Depends on your perspective. Let’s take it from the humble beginnings of Russia some thousand years ago and see how it went. Case 1 A bunch of Scandinavians made a technological breakthrough that allowed them to speedily build boats that could navigate both shallow river courses and rough seas. That allowed them access to an abundant source of slaves in the far forests of Eastern Europe whom they then brought to rich markets in the Roman Empire and beyond. In a matter of a century, Kievan Rus surged out of nowhere as the largest—and possibly richest—kingdom north of Constantinople. Was it a curse? Not for the guys who ruled the place and their customers. And us, who inherited this place and its legends. Case 2 In the beginning of the 13th century, the Crusaders busted the Roman Empire. Overnight, our giant market in the south disappeared. Rus lands, already fractured into dozens of competing fiefdoms, found themselves impoverished because the Mediterranean trade was our only source of wealth. We had to use glass beads and exotic shells for money. Rus lands—easily and mostly by our own volition— became a dull backwater of the Golden Horde. Curse as promised? Sure. Case 3 Over a couple of centuries, we became good business partners with the Turks along the Volga river who took over the Chingizide Empire. That allowed us to earn good money selling furs and other valuable things that were abundant in our forests. The world headed into the Little Ice Age. People were throwing money at our merchants. Rulers of Muscovy knew how to pick that money and use it for important government business. In the 16th century, we gobbled up the shards of the Chingizide empire and started our epic slow march toward the Pacific and southward to the Silk Road. We became the largest land on Earth. Our territory and riches hidden beneath it are a legacy from that time. Was it a curse? Indigenous locals might agree. But certainly not a curse for us. Case 4 Some hundred years ago, a small group of Marxists grabbed power in what was left after the collapsed Russian Empire. A devastating Civil War followed. Pigheaded attempts to implement the Marxian 10-point Action Plan from the Communist Manifesto made us a continent-sized smoldering ruin. But eight blessed years of market-based “new economic policy” followed. Timid Capitalism soon put us back on our feet. And then in the 1930s Stalin shrewdly got our Western enemies to put together for us the greatest military-industrial machine the world had seen. This won us WW2 and later made us a space-age nuclear superpower. How did we do it? We threw a whopping mass of resources on the task, all our own. A curse? Heck no. Case 5 In the 1980s, international petroleum markets imploded. Since exported oil and gas were the life source for the hugely ineffective Soviet machine, the USSR imploded soon after. We lost the Cold War. Our mighty country was torn apart into 15 different states, several at war with each other and themselves. Misery, chaos, and humiliation followed for millions and millions of us. Looks exactly like a curse to me. Case 6 At the turn of the century, things looked bleak for Russia. But suddenly, the international commodity markets surged into the stratosphere. The world was again throwing money at us. Again! And our new confident ruler with solid KGB credentials knew how to pick that money and put it to serious government business. What was new, he allowed much of this windfall of riches to rain on us, mere commoners. That was an era of unseen prosperity and peace for millions and millions of Russians. Our beloved President made a solid claim to become the best ruler of Russia, ever. Could he pull this off without oil and gas and the rest of the stuff we chop down, dig up, pump over, and sell to the world? Nope. Some Russians may call our President a curse. But for the generation of Soviet old-timers like me, this was a blessing. Below, a symbolic scene from downtown Moscow. A big statue of Rus duke Vladimir who together with his Varangian guard baptized our country “with fire and sword” stands right outside the Kremlin. You see a shining red star on one of the Kremlin’s towers above his head. This illustrates the 3D vision we practice in Russia on curses and blessings. In our mind, the red pentagram of belligerent atheists, internationalists, and haters of historical Russia goes perfectly fine with Orthodox piety, imperial past, and defiant nationalism. At any given moment, we pick whatever works. We leave it to neurotic intellectuals to worry about labels to put on it."},{"instruction":"As an IITian, what is the best piece of advice you would give to a JEE aspirant?","output":"Just dont get any advice from anyone i m enough to direct myself anyway Dont let this preparation erase your natural interest and potential of solving problem geniusly dont move onward because collge mile ga move onward mjey mai miloon ga these questions which i solve make me me i listen to them from heart"},{"instruction":"What TV series are worth watching?","output":"The Office2.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"Here’s an answer from the flip side. I wasn’t originally going to answer this question but I read some of the responses and wanted to give the child’s perspective on what it’s like for a parent to request a paternity test. My mother divorced my biological father when I was two years old, back in 2003. She tried to get full custody as she didn’t want him in my life (for good reason, we’ll get to that in a second) but the judge worked something out that meant I had to go with him every other weekend (I don’t know the technical term for it. Some form of joint custody). My mom ended up re-marrying less than a year after she got divorced. I know that sounds fishy to some people but they’ve been married ever since and my step-dad is the one I actually call dad and have for a long time. He fought to stay in my life. What a good dad, right? Right… we’ll refer to him as SD from here on out. Sperm Donor. When I was seven years old I got my bag packed and ready on a Friday after school, wondering what we were going to do that weekend. I also remember being really anxious because the previous weekend he had me there’d been a lot of drama between me and his girlfriend at the time. We’ll call her M. Let me tell you about M. M was the type of lady to threaten me and lie about it when I told my mom what she said. M was the type of lady who would spank me (I don’t have an issue with disciplining your children but keep in mind this woman was NOT even married to my biological father) for getting out of bed too early in the morning and trying to wake them up because I was hungry. M was the type of woman to constantly berate and throw shade at my mother right in front of me. She absolutely hated my guts and the previous weekend accused me of being mean to her daughter which made SD mad at me and when he’d dropped me off he gave my mom a piece of his mind about my “behavior”. SD never showed up to come get me for the next visit. At 7 years old I was very upset and cried and cried. My mom kept trying to call him and he wasn’t answering the phone. She didn’t tell me at the time but I found out several years later that he did answer the phone once to tell my mom she could keep me before hanging up on her. I didn’t know it at the time but the previous weekend when all that arguing happened would be my last weekend with him. My little seven year old heart was crushed. I wrote letters that my mom dutifully mailed asking him to come get me for our weekends again. I missed my paternal grandparents who I only ever got to see on my weekends with him and I missed playing with M’s daughter and I just did not understand what was happening. My eighth birthday passed and he didn’t so much as call. Then one day my mom gets a phone call. The phone call that pertains to this question. See, part of the custody agreement was child support. Child support he paid my mom. Again, didn’t know it at the time because I was 8, but he had stopped paying his child support and when my mom called him out for it he went to Job and Family Services- or maybe he went to court, I’m not sure- demanding a DNA test because suddenly he didn’t think I was his child and wasn’t going to pay money for a kid he didn’t think was his. My mom explained it to me as best she could and tried to make me understand that I’d done nothing wrong, nobody was mad at me, it wasn’t my fault, he was doing this because he was mad at her. On a summer day, I went into that place and sat on my mom’s lap as a lady swabbed the inside of my cheek and took my picture. SD was in the room, too, but he wouldn’t even look at me. The results came back. I was his child. (Unfortunately). The results changed absolutely nothing. Sitting there in that room getting my cheek swabbed was the last time I saw him. That’s coming on a decade ago. He didn’t care whether or not I was his child. He was done with me. I tried writing more letters and they got sent back in the mail. He moved an hour and a half away and changed his phone number. When I was twelve years old, I found his address online and wrote him a letter. It didn’t get sent back but I also didn’t get a reply, so I sent another one a month or two later and the second one got sent back. He moved again to another city about two hours away. Two years ago I looked it up and found another address. Sent him a letter, it got sent back. Tried again, it got sent back. When I was 15 I took my step-dad’s last name. SD is really just a memory at this point, and as I’ve gotten older I find that those memories are not as fond as I once thought they were. I will never forget the day they took my DNA for the paternity test. I saw his car in the parking lot and my little heart nearly gave out I was so excited. I was sure as soon as I got in there he would tell me what had been going on and everything would go back to normal. I went in there and he would not even look at me. And I really don’t understand. I don’t understand why he fought to be in my life when I was 2 only to abandon me at 7. I found out from along the grape vine that he ended up marrying M and adopted her daughter. I don’t understand why he threw me out of his life and ran but then signed right on for another kid. Something else I don’t understand, looking at my baby picture, is the paternity test. Any half-blind human being can look at that baby picture and look at him and know I am his biological child. Just like he knew. I don’t know if he really just requested the DNA test because he was mad at my mom or not but it doesn’t matter to me. What he did hurt me in ways I don’t even know how to talk about and despite his absence, despite going on 10 years without any contact with him, I can’t stop thinking about the whole thing. In recent years, I have learned: My mother divorced him because of his infidelity. He cheated on her (most likely more than once)He was discharged from the Army because of a psych evaluation. I don’t know what was in the evaluation or what his issues were but I can take a few guesses.He was mean. Not mean to me necessarily, but mean to my mom and mean to other people. I don’t think he saw me as his daughter. I think he saw me as a possession. All these years later, I know I’m better off without him and yet I’m still constantly trying to put it together. I think the next time I do see him will be at his funeral."},{"instruction":"What is your opinion of Adam Schiff presenting indisputable evidence that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia and criticising the GOP?","output":"The only thing Schiff has presented “indisputable evidence” of is his own, unhinged bias and dishonesty."},{"instruction":"What is something that you will never do?","output":"I never understand why people do such behaviour.

It's important to consider both the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions. Here are some points to consider: 1. Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility. While this volatility can present opportunities for significant gains, it also comes with the risk of substantial losses. If you're comfortable with and can withstand price fluctuations, you may consider investing in cryptocurrencies. 2. Potential Returns: The cryptocurrency market has experienced periods of substantial growth, and some investors have seen significant returns on their investments. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and it's essential to remember that the market can be unpredictable. 3. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can be seen as a form of diversification in an investment portfolio. Adding cryptocurrencies to a well-diversified portfolio that includes traditional assets can potentially provide exposure to new investment opportunities. 4. Technological Innovation: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to disrupt various industries and enable new forms of decentralized applications. Some investors are attracted to the technological advancements and potential long-term value in this space. On the other hand, there are several risks to consider: 1. Market Volatility: The same volatility that can lead to potential gains can also result in significant losses. Cryptocurrency prices can be subject to dramatic swings, which can be challenging to predict or manage. 2. Regulatory and Legal Risks: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations can impact the market and investor sentiment. It's important to stay informed about the legal and regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction. 3. Security Risks: Cryptocurrency investments come with security risks, such as the potential for hacks, scams, or loss of access to digital wallets. It's crucial to understand and implement best practices for securing your investments. 4. Lack of Regulation and Transparency: The cryptocurrency market is relatively unregulated compared to traditional financial markets. This lack of regulation can result in issues such as market manipulation, fraud, and limited transparency. It's important to conduct thorough research, educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider consulting with a financial advisor who specializes in cryptocurrencies to get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

The reason? Short answer: The purported wave function collapse can be uncollapsed by measurement of another incompatible observable. The original collapse is now gone. Long answer: There are compatible and incompatible measurements represented by different observables. Compatibility means that different observables share the same type of purported collapse. When measurement of one type of compatible observable collapses the wave function, subsequent measurement of the second does not uncollapse it. Formally the commutator [A,B] = 0, meaning same eigenstates. Let's call these |A> and |B>, and the original state |S>. Incompatibility means observables share different types of collapse. That the collapse of one is not accompanied by the collapse of the other. So measurement of first observable collapses the wavefunction into an eigenstate of the first observable. But now a measurement of the 2nd observable collapses the wavefunction into an eigenstate of the 2nd observable. This is not the collapsed first observable eigenstate. In other words the initial collapse has been uncollapsed. Formally the commutator [A,B] is not equal to 0, meaning different eigenstates for A and B. Let's call these |A> and |B>, and the original state |S>. When |S> collapses to |A> on measuring A, a subsequent measurement of B puts it into |B>. This is not the same as |A>. If the A measurement is going to be carried out again, it will not behave as if the system was in the original collapsed state |A>."},{"instruction":"Do British people wholeheartedly agree with Suella Braverman when she said “Boris Johnson is one of the greatest prime ministers ever”?","output":"It seems not.

It would seem to me that people like Stephen Hawking lost hope. I can only suspect that he did and I can’t help but to think that it is because “HE” was not able to figure the theory of everything out (now I can be wrong). In any case, the reason why I suspect that he gave up is because anyone that goes along with the multiverse theory, could only join into this ridiculous theory if they gave up. I agree with Viktor Toth on many aspects of his answer… But one thing that strikes me is he seems to think that the direct approach to solve gravity could be successful. It will not happen that way because as long as physicists use established math and known equations, they cannot find the underlying reason of how the experimentally determined parameters we take for granted in our equations came to exist. Those parameter are things like charge, distance, and what creates “straight” and a spatial dimension. I totally agree with Viktor that there is no reason to say that finding a theory of everything cannot be done since we do observe gravity and quantum phenomenon in the same universe. Viktor Toth is absolutely correct about the motivation for figuring out the theory of everything is not for the money… I developed Gordon’s Theory of Everything out of curiosity as to why the speed of light is the same in all reference frames.

While the 35 year old gurkha soldier was traveling in Maurya Express train from Ranchi to Gorakhpur, during midnight time in Chittaranjan jungles of West Bengal, around 30-40 armed robbers boarded the train and started looting the passengers. Later they started misbehaving with an 18 year old girl in front of her helpless parents, which is when Bishnu lost his cool. He took out his Khukuri (knife) and fought the group of robbers single handedly. He killed three of them in the fight and injured eight others. The remaining robbers got scared of Bishnu’s brave attack and fled the scene. The Indian army soldier explained about the incident saying: “They started snatching jewelry, cell phones, cash, laptops and other belongings from the passengers. They had carried out their robbery with swords, blades and pistols. The pistols may have been fake as they didn´t open fire. The girl cried for help, saying ´You are a soldier, please save a sister´. I prevented her from being raped, thinking of her as my own sister. Fighting the enemy in battle is my duty as a soldier; taking on the dacoits in the train was my duty as a human being.” During the fight, Bishnu had to suffer serious blade injury on his left hand, and the girl also had a small cut on her neck. However, the brave gurkha soldier managed to make good use of his Khukuri and save the chastity of a girl, along with hundreds of thousands in loot. Appreciating this brave act of Bishnu, his Gorkha Regiment gave him a cash reward of Rs. 50,000 and also terminated his voluntary retirement, so that he would get benefits of a customary promotion after receiving the medals of recognition. Bishnu Shrestha also received the Sena Medal for bravery from the Indian Army. Cheers to his brave and responsible act!"},{"instruction":"Circle B's radius is 1/3 the size of circle A's. Circle B travels around circle A one time. How many times does circle B spin around itself?","output":"I only recently encountered this question, through a video posted online, which most people on here have probably already viewed. That video asserted that the answer was 4 revolutions. That is incorrect. I will attach two short papers explaining the phenomenon at issue: 1) the first addresses the smaller circle revolving around the outside of the larger circle; 2) the second addresses the smaller circle revolving around the inside of the larger circle. Since I am unable to attach Word documents, I have converted each paper to image files. The first paper consists of the first 3 pages; the second paper consists of the following 5 pages. The answer is that the smaller circle (Circle B here) will revolve (or, spin completely around its own axis of rotation) 3 times, NOT 4 times. Despite the fact that an “experiment” or “demonstration” appears to indicate that the smaller circle will complete 4 revolutions, that is an optical illusion. (Full explanation is provided in the first attached paper, the first 3 pages/images attached.) There are several points to consider: the smaller circle will complete a revolution once each point on its perimeter touches the surface along which it is travelinghowever, our visual perception of orientation depends on focusing on the center point of the smaller circle (or the writing on it, as it relates to the center of the circle)the center point of the smaller circle traces out a different circle, which we can call Circle C, which has a larger radius that is the sum of the radii of the other circles (R1+R2)focusing on the center point of Circle B as it travels along Circle C distorts our perception of when Circle B is “upright,” and thus when it has completed a revolution the most important point - the smaller circle’s axis of rotation is, itself, revolving as it travels along the larger circlesome people may say that the axis of rotation does not revolve - that only applies where the objects comprising the system are FIXED in relation to each other; in this scenario, they are NOT FIXED, which results in the axis of rotation revolvingin general, when a circle travels along a surface, its axis of rotation will revolve in harmony with the contours of the surface it is traversing the illusion of a 4th revolution results from the revolution of the smaller circle’s axis of rotation, which itself completes a single 360 degree revolution (that is the 4th revolution) But let’s also consider the correlate scenario, where the smaller circle makes a trip around the inside of the larger circle. A “demonstration” of that scenario would result in the conclusion that the smaller circle would complete merely 2 revolutions during that trip. Just as a matter of common sense, how is it possible that a circle with a circumference of 2pi can cover a distance of 6pi in just 2 revolutions? That would be one magic circle indeed! For that matter, how does it makes sense that it would require that circle 4 revolutions to travel around the outside perimeter, but only 2 revolutions to travel around the inside perimeter when the inner perimeter is exactly the same distance as the outer perimeter? In fact, applying the logic of the points identified above, we find that the smaller circle completes the same 3 revolutions when traversing the inner perimeter as it does when it traverses the outer perimeter. The only difference here is that the smaller circle’s axis of rotation is revolving in the opposite direction that the smaller circle itself is revolving when it traverses the inner perimeter. When it was traversing the outer perimeter, both the axis of rotation and the circle itself were revolving in the same direction. Thus, when traversing the inside, the revolution of the axis of rotation detracts one full revolution from the apparent number of revolutions that the smaller circle completes. (The second attached paper describes this scenario in further detail. That paper consists of pages/images 4–8 attached here.) Just a note: The video in which I saw this question presented had Circle A being the smaller circle, revolving around Circle B as the larger circle. Thus, in my papers, Circle A is the smaller circle that is moving around the larger circle.

This movie was produced by Akbar Khan, the youngest brother of Firoz Khan on a grand scale with enormous budget, the hero was a handsome hunk with a modelling career and the heroine was a Pakistani beauty perhaps her name was Sonya Jahan. All the screens in IMAX Wadala were reserved for the premier and the show was scheduled at 8 PM. We reached in the evening and found ourselves amongst top bollywood celebrities rubbing shoulders with them. The entire Khan family including Sanjay Khan, the Kapoor family, perhaps all three Khans, Sanjay Khan's son-in- law Hrithik Roshan and his entire family were present. I am not a great bollywood person ( I was during my student life) but the gathering was huge with hardly any celebrity missing). Expensive drinks including alcoholic ones were served to guests with snacks from Taj Mahal Palace hotel. We were almost full and were interested in knowing the main course dishes for a bite only. However the massive dinner tables were laden with stuff from Taj Caterers but lids were not open. The movie scheduled to start at 8 PM, ultimately started at 10PM and till that time the dinner was not served. Reluctantly we entered the screen and movie begun. It was one of the worst movie ever seen by us with lavish sets but extremely poor acting and direction. Later we found that it sank without a trace. The old Taj Mahal movie with Pradeep Kumar and Bina Rai was thousand times better than this. While watching the movie, I came out many times to know whether the dinner was served but the it was not. Somehow we passed time till interval and decided to leave if dinner was still not served. We were not hungry but only interested in knowing the main course and sweet dishes being served. The dinner was still not open though it was around 11.30 PM. Then I asked one of the Catering Managers present near the tables what was the reason for dinner not being served. He gave a honest reply that if the dinner is served now, no one will watch the movie till the end.

This Could be a threat to many other companies like Amazon, Netflix, Fintech Startups (Phonepe, Paytm and GPay). Jio had spent 3 billion dollars to acquire dozens of Companies in last one year including Saavan, Haptik, Nowflots etc. Jio has more than 388 million users, which is highest among all Indian telecom companies. And Facebook was also desperate to make a big move in India but it had failed previously with Net neutrality. So by Investing in Jio, It could do what they wanted 3 years back. Jio has been working on a super app like WeChat and Indian apps like Paytm or Phonepe. Facebook sees plenty of opportunity with Jio. India is a large market for Facebook; more than 400 million people in the country use WhatsApp, its global messaging service, while more than 300 million people use the company’s core social network. WhatsApp has worked for years to build tools for small businesses and has dabbled in payment systems, while Facebook has also invested in creating digital storefronts for entrepreneurs to sell goods and services online. By bringing together JioMart, Jio’s small-business initiative, with WhatsApp, they can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience. More recently, Facebook has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over WhatsApp. The government has demanded that WhatsApp change its encryption to trace messages back to their source, which WhatsApp has refused to do. At the same time, regulators have repeatedly delayed WhatsApp’s request to offer a payments service to its Indian users. Ambani has also been the most powerful corporate voice urging regulators to take an India first approach that favours companies like Facebook and Amazon. But this partnership can bring life to Whatsapp pay in India. If it is true then Jio will enter in E-commerce and Media Industry using Jiomart and Jio Tv enabled by Whatsapp Pay. Which is the biggest threat to Amazon, they will become head to head competitors Because of Prime Videos and Amazon E-commerce. Jio has ambitions to take on Amazon in e-commerce, run data centres, provide fibre internet to homes and businesses and set up new services like telehealth and distance learning.

Take your cat to your veterinarian. Travel, especially air travel, can be difficult for cats. You want to ensure your cat is healthy enough for the flight. Your veterinarian will examine her and make sure she is up to date on all of her vaccinations. If your cat has an illness, ask your veterinarian how it can be managed or treated (if possible) prior to your flight. Your veterinarian may need to complete a health certificate for your cat, certifying she is healthy enough for travel and has all of the required vaccinations. The health certificate requirements may vary according to your destination, so confirm these requirements with the airline before your appointment. There are time restrictions on health certificate completion. Airlines typically require health certificates to be completed within 10 days of a flight, but confirm your airline's specific time restriction. Ask your veterinarian to microchip your cat for easy identification. If your cat is already microchipped, consider asking your veterinarian to scan the microchip to make sure it can be read. If your cat is on medication, ask your veterinarian about how you can continue to medicate your cat on your day of travel. 2. Purchase an airline-approved carrier. If you have not traveled by plane with your cat before, you may need to purchase an airline-approved pet carrier. Call your airline or search the airline’s website for pet carrier requirements for cabin and cargo travel. Generally, a ‘cabin’ cat carrier should be made of a durable fabric (e.g., nylon), be well ventilated, and have a zippered top and side door. Your airline may also require the carrier to have a soft removable bottom pad. A good cargo carrier should be made of sturdy and durable plastic and have a secure door latch. Make sure the carrier is large enough for your cat to move around and be comfortable in. 3. Encourage your cat to spend time in her carrier. Your cat will need at least one month to get ready for air travel. During this time, invite your cat to spend more time in his/her carrier. Make it look inviting by putting some of her creature comforts inside of it, such as comfortable bedding and favorite toys. Leave the carrier open at all times in a location where your cat frequents, such as her bed or a scratching post. This lets your cat explore her carrier at her leisure and without fear of you closing the door when she steps inside of it. Consider spraying cat pheromones inside the carrier so it smells familiar to her. Feed her in the carrier so she can have a positive association with it. Practice closing the door when she is inside of it (after you've given her time to explore it). Start by closing the door for a few seconds, then opening it and immediately giving her a treat. Slowly increase the amount of you leave the door closed before opening it and giving her a treat. 4. Take your cat on car rides. When your cat is comfortable with her carrier, place her inside of it and take her on car rides. Start with short car rides — just around the block and back. As she gets more comfortable with car travel, take her on longer rides. Secure the carrier in the car with a seatbelt. Take your cat to a desirable location, such as back home — not the veterinarian’s office. Give her a treat at the end of the car ride if she behaves well (no scratching or incessant crying). Staying still in the carrier while the car is moving may be a bit bewildering to your cat at first, but she will get used to it over time. Try to start the car rides at least a few weeks before your flight. 5. Acclimate your cat to loud noises. Not only is the plane noisy, but the airport can be noisy too. When your cat is comfortable with car rides, take her to the airport and sit outside with her in the carrier. The loud noise and commotion may be terrifying for your cat at first, so it will probably take a few trips to the airport before your cat becomes used to the loud noises. You could also take her inside the airport, near the flight check-in area. Give your cat some treats to reward her for good behavior. Allow a few weeks for your cat to get accustomed to airport noises. 6. your cat’s nails. Trim If your cat’s nails are long, she could use them to scratch up the interior of her carrier during the flight. If she has to travel in the cargo area, she could get her nails stuck in the carrier’s bars, which could lead to injury. If you are not comfortable trimming your cat’s nails, have your veterinarian do so. A cat’s nails should be trimmed once every 10 days to 2 weeks, so time the nail trimming so her nails do not become long again before the trip. If you will be away from home for a long time, bring some nail clippers with you. Part 2 of 3:Making Other Travel Preparations1. Book your flight. Airlines are often limited with how many pets can travel in the plane’s cabin. For this reason, you should book your flight well in advance (1 month or more) to increase the chances of your cat staying with you in the cabin. When you call to book your flight, ask if the airline allows pets on the plane, and if your cat can travel in the cabin. Because of your cat’s small size, it is preferable for her to travel in the cabin rather than the cargo hold. Expect to pay an extra fee for your cat, which may be up to 100. Be aware that, if your cat can travel with you in the cabin, her carrier will count as one of your allotted carry-ons. When you book your flight, make sure to get a locator number for your cat that is associated with your seat number. Try to book a direct, nonstop flight. Also, avoid booking a flight for the middle of the day in the summer. 2. Check your cat’s ID collar. Your cat’s ID collar should have several tags: one with your contact information (name, address, cell phone number), and one tag each for rabies vaccination status and your cat’s license. Remove any collar accessories, such as small trinkets or charms, that could get easily snagged on a part of her carrier. Make sure her collar is appropriate for travel before your flight. 3. Make labels for your cat’s carrier. This is particularly important if your cat will be traveling in the cargo hold, but would also be a good idea for cabin travel. The label should contain your own contact information, as well as contact information at your end destination. For example, if you will be staying at a hotel, write down the hotel’s name, address, and phone number on the label. Place a label on the inside and outside of the carrier, in case the outside label comes off during the course of travel. In addition, if your cat will be traveling in the cargo hold, make a few large ‘Live Animal’ labels and place them on the outside of her carrier. Make the labels at least a few days before your trip so you will not have to rush to do it on the day of travel. 4. Prepare bags of dry food for your cat. Cats should travel on an empty stomach to prevent vomiting or elimination accidents in the carrier during the flight. However, if your flight gets delayed for several hours or more, it would be a good idea to give your cat a few nibbles of food to keep her from getting too hungry. If your cat is in the cargo hold for a long flight, attach a bag of food to the carrier with feeding instructions. Part 3 of 3:Preparing Your Cat on the Day of Air Travel1. Keep your normal routine. As much as possible, keep a calm and normal routine on the travel day. Cats do not always respond well to change, so a sudden change in routine could increase your cat’s anxiety and stress levels and may cause her to act out (e.g., eliminate outside of her litter box). Keep calm in your preparations and try to maintain her normal feeding schedule so she uses her litterbox as she usually would. Once you put her in her carrier, she will not be able to eliminate again until after you arrive at your destination. Keeping things calm and normal will help her empty her bladder and bowels before you place her in the carrier. 2. Feed your cat 4 to 6 hours before your flight. Maintaining a normal feeding schedule may be tricky if your flight is less than 4 to 6 hours before her regular mealtime. During your month of preparation, consider gradually adjusting her mealtime so it will coincide with the 4- to 6-hour window of time before your flight. Alternatively, you could try to find a flight that time that would fall within 4 to 6 hours of her regular mealtime. Once you have fed her before the flight, do not feed her again until after you arrive at your destination. You or the flight staff may have to feed her, though, if you have an international flight or a flight with multiple stops. Your cat can have water up to 1 hour before the flight. 3. Give your cat her medications. If your cat is currently on medications, schedule their administration according to your travel schedule. Do give your cat a tranquilizer before your flight, unless advised by your vet. Tranquilizers can affect your cat’s ability to regulate her body temperature, which can have serious consequences if she is traveling in the cargo hold. If giving tranquilizers, test the medication on your cat at least a couple of days before. This will allow you to calculate the ideal dose and avoid overdosing or underdosing the cat on the travel day. In addition, the tranquilizer test dose will wear off before travel day. 4. Secure your cat in its carrier. Before you leave the house, make sure your cat is securely within the carrier. An airport can be a frightening place for cats, and you do not want to give her any opportunity to bolt out of her carrier. To make the carrier more comfortable for her, make it smell familiar (e.g., cat pheromones, her bedding, clothing with your scent on it). If you must take her out of its carrier at airport security, keep a very firm hold on it. Ask the airport security staff if you can go through an alternative screening where your cat can stay in the carrier. 5. Keep your cat calm. Whether your cat will be traveling with you in the cabin or in the cargo hold, practice some verbal and nonverbal communication to keep it calm before the flight. For example, look at her in her carrier and blink slowly until she blinks back—this is a positive form of communication for cats. In addition, you can talk to her reassuringly before and during the flight."},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"It’s to do with their sociology and hunting characteristics. Felines usually hunt alone, stalking their prey. For this they need to be massively powerful to bring down usually much bigger prey than themselves. This means they need a large skeletal frame and muscle mass and explosive energy to bring down an animal fast. They go for the jugular and end it within seconds. They are like the muscle-bound 100m Olympic sprinters. Canines usually hunt in packs. They do not require the same level of size or muscle mass, which is a huge liability and requires an incredible amount of food to sustain.

If we all put down our defensive stance for a moment and just discuss “gun regulations” I believe we will find ourselves on the same channel. Putting aside a minority of extreme no comprimise opponents you might be surprised that most of us DO feel the need for reasonable firmarms regulation. What gets our defenses up is that so many seem to want gun confiscation, not just gun regulation. I’m convinced most of us would like to see illegally obtained firearms out of the hands of the actual bad actors committing crimes including murder. Our justice system seems to be geared in the hoodlums favor constantly setting them free immediately and in many cases with no bail. Yet we seem to find the law abiding armed citizen to be the cause and root of all firearms evil. Speaking for myself only, I firmly believe gun regulations are necessary and serve a good purpose. Many things I do or have done in life required a license or permit that was intended to show my ability to competently and safely perform the task at hand and a firearm is no different. But seeking totalitarian revocation of owning a firearm is not how to go at it. I live in California where firearm regulations are very strick and even though I have no problem with most of them it seems crime is still high and actually rising. As a society we direct our firearms regulations more strickly to the legal owners instead of the criminals. Even as a US Marine Veteran of 8 years with fairly good rifle and handgun training here is what I needed to do to buy a handgun in California. a) Showed my California Real ID along with supporting proof of residency. b) Took a 30 question FSC (Firearm Safety Certificate) written test. c) Paid 25 after passing FSC to obtain a DOJ Safety Certificate good for 5 years. d) Paid 7 fee for DROS1 Turner Outdoorsman Dealer Handling Fee. e) Paid 5 fee for DROS EQ fee California Dept. of Justice (DOJ) f) Paid 1 fee for DROS1 California DOJ Safety Fee. g) Paid 31.19 fee For DROS DOJ DES fee California h) 10 day waiting period started after completing a-g above. i) Returned after 10 days to take possession of handgun. J) Completed final paperwork and gave my thumb print. k) Performed a safety check with staff to prove I could operate the new firearm. l) Paid off balance owed and departed the place of business. j) We also get charged a 1 DOJ fee every time we want to buy a box of ammunition. I have recently applied (Aug 2022) for a CCW permit via the San Diego County Sheriff. My interview date for determination is June 5, 2023 so that is 10 months waiting just to get the interview. My fees just for the determination process: Application fee20, Live Scan fee93, Final fee80, TOTAL193. If I get approved I then have to take a full 8 hour CCW course which includes classroom and live fire training at a range and that cost 200. When approved my permit is only valid for 2 years. Can we agree that the law abiding citizen is put through some serious regulatory process just to legally own a firearm? So why not make it hard on criminals who REFUSE to play by the rules? Do the crime and expect to do the time and pay retribution to those violated! As a legal gun owner with absolutely no criminal record I have no problem with reasonable firearms regulations. But that does not mean total confiscation which appears to be the goal of so many anti-gun advocates. I feel most firearm owners are up for discussion about gun regulations. But those opposing firearms who can’t tell the difference between a fully automatic M16 and a Ruger mini 14 ranch rifle need to be willing to listen and educate themselves just as well."},{"instruction":"What is the tweet of day 18 of July 2021?","output":"A pornographic video was circulated on WhatsApp by a group run by some Muslim youths in Farukkabad in UP.

Rotary engines fixed the crankshaft to the airframe and the engine cylinder spun. The they decided this has too many disadvantages, so the engine was fixed and the crank spun. It makes for a somewhat compact engine in a linear sense but produces much more drag than an inline engine. Radials are generally a bit heavier than inline liquid cooled engines and produce less HP per CU in (KW/L). Liquid cooling means you can also use higher boost pressures with a supercharger without detonation. One advantage of radials is if you wanted more power you just add a row of cylinders. This culminated in the R-3350 [LINKED_TEXT: Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone - Wikipedia1937 18-cylinder radial piston engine family by Wright The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone is an American twin-row, supercharged , air-cooled, radial aircraft engine with 18 cylinders displacing nearly 3,350 cubic inches (54.9 L). Power ranged from 2,200 to over 3,700 hp (1,640 to 2,760 kW), depending on the model. Developed before World War II , the R-3350's design required a long time to mature before finally being used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to become a major civilian airliner design, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1950s. The engine is commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races . Its main rival was the 4,360 in 3 (71.4 L), 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , first run some seven years after the Duplex-Cyclone's beginnings. Design and development [ edit ] In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its famous \\"Cyclone\\" engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to redesign the engine to the 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran successfully in 1935, and became one of the most-used aircraft engines in the 1930s and WWII, powering all frontline examples (the -C through -G models) of the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber aircraft serving in the war, each powerplant assisted by a General Electric -designed turbocharger for maximum power output at high altitudes. By 1931 Pratt & Whitney had started a development of their equally famous single-row, Wasp nine-cylinder design into a larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row design — the R-1830 Twin Wasp — of a nearly identical 30-liter displacement figure, that would easily compete with this larger, single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&W's lead, and developed much larger engines based on the mechanics of the Cyclone. The result was two designs with a somewhat shorter stroke, a 14-cylinder design of almost 43 liters displacement that would evolve into the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone , and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the Wright R-4090 Cyclone 22 , was experimented with as a competitor to the 71.5 liter-displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , but was not produced. With Pratt & Whitney starting development of their own 46 liter-displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row high-output radial as the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in 1937, Wright's first R-3350 prototype engines — itself having a nearly 55 liter displacement figure — were initially run in May of the same year. Continued development was slow, both due to the complex nature of the engine, as well as the R-2600 receiving considerably more attention. The R-3350 did not fly until 19https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone]and 4360 engines [LINKED_TEXT: Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia R-28 piston aircraft engine family The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II . First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family , and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology. The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets , but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56 ). Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone , first run some seven years earlier (May 1937). Design and development [ edit ] The R-4360 was a 28- cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \\"corncob\\" nickname. [1] A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds. The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri . [2] The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required. [ citation needed ] Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest. Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy. [3] Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era. Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg). Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built. A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E , was essentially the R-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major]producing over 3000 hp. The disadvantage is more moving parts means far less reliability and LOTS of maintenance per flying hour. As soon as turboprops came along radials were largely doomed because turboprops produce much more HP per lb (are lighter and more powerful) and orders of magnitude more reliable."},{"instruction":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","output":"Quora is a CCP operation"},{"instruction":"Can we defeat Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle by having one person measure the particle's position, while another one measures its momentum, but the two people don't talk to each other, but give their results to a third party?","output":"When we talk about “observers,” think about the test doing the measuring rather than the human looking at the testing instrument. How do you measure something? You measure something by getting another thing to interact with it. You observe a potted plant by seeing photons bounce off of it, for example. If there are no photons bouncing off it, the room is dark and you can’t see the plant. The potted plant is large. The photons are small. So the light doesn’t seem to interfere with the position or speed of the potted plant. That’s the situation we’re used to when we think about “observing” things. But that situation doesn’t really give us an intuitive grasp of trying to measure a single tiny particle/wave with another single other particle/wave. That’s more like trying to find a potted plant in the dark by throwing other potted plants at it. With subatomic particles, the things we’re using to observe are a bit more on-scale with what’s being observed. And this is where things start to get weird, because of wave-particle duality. So lets turn out the lights and go to a pool table. You want to figure out the location of a pool ball somewhere on the table (which is actually both a wave and a particle, because that’s how things are at this level.) And you can only do this by throwing other wave/particle pool balls. So now things are getting a bit more tricky, because every time you ‘look’ at your target, you disturb it. Interacting with a particle to ‘see’ it inherently changes the setup you’re looking at! But things are even worse than that, because of the ‘wave’ aspect of the balls we’re using. Everything we throw is both kindof a wave and kindof a particle to some extent. So lets say we use a photon to bounce off a pool ball. It’s a really low energy photon, so it won’t disturb the ball too much. Low energy means that it has a large wavelength, so it’s like throwing a huge circular pillow with almost no weight. You don’t disturb your target much, but it’s hard to figure out where your target is by throwing these huge, fluffy, light weight pillows. Okay, so lets use a wave with more energy now. The wavelength is smaller. It’s like a bullet. Tiny. Accurate. But it disturbs the heck out of the system we’re observing. You shoot our target pool ball with your bullet and the ball goes ricocheting off to who-knows-where. The more accurate we get (small particle), the more we disturb the system we’re trying to observe in unpredictable ways. Edit: And this doesn’t even begin to get into the difficulties illuminated by the double-slit experiment, where subatomic particles exist as a sort of probability cloud until they’re observed as particles."},{"instruction":"What are some of the best actual images of real atoms and molecules?","output":"Here are some pictures of atoms I took yes it is possible to photograph.

This illustrates the point that we are human too. He might have been at end of shift or like most of us just wanted you to comply with the posted speed. Now for another story. In 2016 I ( with the permission of my wife of course) purchased a brand spanking new Mustang. I drove it all over town showing it off to friends. Now a lot of my friends were local police officers. They all knew that I was a retired officer. They all started to make bets on how fast it would really go. I asked them where they were going with this. The Chief said he had an idea. Now you must know that this is a very small town ( population of about 1,600 ). And there is absolutely no traffic after 9pm. So now Chief Jones says to meet him on the old highway at midnight. I'm starting to feel like a teenager again. Now I arrived at the location and the Chief says try her out sarge, (my nick name ). I told him that he was crazy, I wasn't going to take off down the road before I drove the road looking for debris in the road. He told me that they already did and that the road was clear. He said that for me to go as fast as I wanted. He said he had an officer at the city limits to make sure that there was no conflict with the county guys. So I tromped on it and burned rubber for about 20 ft. I actually got up to 160 mph with plenty of pedal left. I drove back to the officers and told them what my top speed was. The Chief said he already knew what the top speed was as they had just received their new radar guns the day before and thought that this was the perfect way to test them. So they got to test the radar and I had a blast. We went back to the station and had coffee and donuts, and all was good in the world. I didn't even charge them for being their unwitting guinea pig."},{"instruction":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","output":"You can start by educating your self in the propensity of governments everywhere and in all times. The people who make up the government always begin to see themselves as the ultimate source of all wisdom and power. They always rationalize how if the little people were just a little smarter and would do the right things all problems would disappear. If the problems don’t go away it is not because the idea was flawed, it must be because the little people are sabotaging it. A law to force compliance will do the trick. That’s why free enterprise is so important to freedom. Bill Hewelett was too stupid to know the tuning mechanism could not be shrunk small enough to make a car radio. The physics of the day just would not allow it. So he just went ahead and did it. So cars in the 50s had radios. Henry Ford found a way to reorganize vehicle manufacture so the vehicle moved down a line of people who only knew how to complete one small portion of the assembly, but they got very good at that one thing. The assembly line was borne and the little guy got his car. Edsele thought they had a better idea, they were wrong and they went out of business. IBM thought they had computers locked up, but they forgot to tell Bill Gates and Microsoft levered into PCs from any manufacturer and in time IBM sold their hardware line to Lenovo. Steve Jobs locked the personal computer down tight. Only he could manufacture it or license software to run on. His hardware is good enough and he turned the iPod into the iPhone and the iPad. The open source PC sells many times the machine count as the PC. Open source Android is cheaper and very good but the single source Apple iPhone and iPad make it easier to design applications and attachments. So the two lines continue to compete with different philosophies. However, they must rely on persuasion of free people. Back to governments. They do not have freely win the support of the masses. They rely on compulsion. Mao had it right when he declared government power grows out the barrel of a gun. The U.S. government just ordered truckers, who work in solitary situations, to lose their jobs because they do not want to be vaccinated. That same government is allowing 10,000 unscreened illegal alien disease vectors into the country everyday and going beyond that to transport them all over the country. They are catching and releasing violent criminals over and over until a particular criminal kills someone the government thinks is important. Cab drivers and convenience store clerks don’t count. The violent crime rates are rising out of control. The criminals are already banned from having a gun, but they are cut loose within 24 hrs to buy another one stolen by a burglar who has been caught 11 times in two weeks. Then the government says guns are the problem. They have enough laws already on the books. If a person commits a violent crime keep them locked up. They won’t commit any more crimes while they are in jail. If a person is arrested while on pretrial release no sane judge would release them again. Canada just locked up the financial accounts of unvaccinated truckers who were nonviolently saying things Trudeau did not like. On top of that Parliament just required a “journalist to be licensed and if the licensing board does not like a person’s opinions that person can not get a license. There is no notice and no appeal. Buy the way, what about the docs who think anyone who wants to use a firearm is ip so facto insane. In one sentence the anti-gunners say rely on the police to protect you from the violent criminals they just released on society. In the next sentence the antis demand the police be abolished.

Here are a few tips to get you started: Firstly, you need to understand your audience. Who are they? What kind of content do they like? What do they share? Once you have a clear understanding of your target audience, it becomes easier to create content that resonates with them. You can use tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Insights to gather insights about your audience. Secondly, keep an eye on industry trends and news. Stay updated with what's happening in your industry and create content around it. This will not only keep your content relevant but also help establish your brand as a thought leader. Thirdly, repurpose your existing content. If you have a blog post or a podcast episode that performed well, turn it into a social media post. You can also create infographics, videos, or memes based on your existing content. This way, you can keep your social media profiles active without creating new content from scratch. Lastly, don't forget to engage with your audience. Social media is all about building relationships. Respond to comments, ask questions, and encourage your followers to share their thoughts. This will not only increase engagement but also give you ideas for future content. I hope these tips help you generate content for social media. Remember, consistency is key. Create a content calendar, plan your posts in advance, and track your performance.

The Nazis blitzkrieged their way into France and took it in 46 days. This was the plan formalized by the German generals. There were many divisions involved in this operation, which was nicknamed Case Yellow/Fall Gelb. Credits for this plan goes to Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian. They meticulously planned out this attack and executed it so perfectly that France was utterly crushed and its army forced to retreat to Dunkirk. This attack was similar to the von Schlieffen plan set in WW1, but with a more vicious streak. The summary was that the German panzer and armoured divisions were to sweep through the countries while pinpointing the locations of the most concentrated pockets of enemy forces, but the armoured divisions did not engage. Rather, the Luftwaffe helped gun most of the enemy divisions down but of course there were still survivors. So, the Wehrmacht foot soldiers were to march behind the violent blitzkrieg action carried out by the Panzers and the Luftwaffe and to wipe out any stragglers and to secure victory within the enemy cities while the enemy was still trying to find out what happened. The only flaw in the plan was Dunkirk, when Hitler ordered the German forces to stop short of the ports near the English Channel, where the remaining French forces were situated, helplessly waiting for the British to arrive. The Luftwaffe was to finish off the enemy forces, but that obviously failed. It was Goring’s suggestion that it was the Luftwaffe, not the Wehrmacht that would finish the French forces. General Heinz Guderian later noted: ‘What the future of the war would have been like if we had succeeded in taking the British Expeditionary Force prisoners at Dunkirk is now impossible to guess.’"},{"instruction":"w do I clean up Gmail quickly?","output":"Go To your Gmail Account and Sign In.

The human mind has a difficult time in fathoming just how big infinity is. That sometimes makes it difficult to properly analyze a problem or discuss ideas related to infinite nature. The logic goes like this: Suppose you have 10 boxes numbered 1 thru 10 lined up. In the next row, you line them up with the #1 moved to the end so the sequence is 2,3,4...9,10,1. In the next row you move the #2 to the end. You keep repeating this until you have created every single permutation of the arrangement of these 10 boxes. Can you guess how many rows of boxes that will be? Every permutation will take 3,628,800 rows. Let’s call this number “K”. If I put out a billion more rows of 10 boxes each, they would all be in one of the “K” arrangements of the boxes. Even if I put out a trillion rows of boxes, all the possible arrangements of the boxes will still be the same finite number “K”. Once we have reached all the possible arrangements of those 10 boxes, any others we add will only be a duplicate of one of the arrangements that is already there. Now imagine that instead of boxes in a row, you are rearranging the atoms that make up matter. For instance, the matter that makes up a star or a planet. All of the possible arrangements of all of the atoms of that planet or sun would be an extremely large number - so big that we probably could not calculate it BUT using logic, we can prove that it is a finite number because the total number of possible arrangement of the boxes is finite - meaning that it is less than infinity. Just within the observable universe - which we estimate to be about 93 billion light years across - there are between 10^78 atoms (that is 10 raised to the 78th power or 10x10x10x10. . . . .78 times) - It might be as large as 10^83.. That's between ten quadrillion vigintillion and one-hundred thousand quadrillion vigintillion atoms. . . . that is a big number however, it IS a finite number. Now imagine that we calculate every possible arrangement of every atom in the universe. Note that the number of atoms in the universe will be infinite in an infinite universe BUT, like those boxes, the possible arrangements of those atoms is finite. Granted, it will be a very very big number but as with those boxes, there are just so many different ways that they can be arranged. The distinction that we are talking about is a finite number of arrangements of those atoms and NOT the number of atoms, is important. Note that we are dealing with very very large numbers here. These are numbers in which the exponent of 10 will easily exceed a billion digits long. Even our fastest computers would not count this high a number. This is well beyond the ability for humans to calculate and we can only deal in numbers on this scale with logic and in the abstract but we can say with certainty which of these numbers are and are not infinite. That means that if you go far enough into the infinite universe, you will have exhausted all of the possible arrangements that atoms can be put together but because space is infinite, the things that those atoms were arranged to be will start repeating themselves. That means that if you go far enough into an infinite universe, you'll find another Earth that looks exactly like this one. But now comes the part that is hard to grasp. Infinity is so much larger than it will take to find that first duplicate Earth, that if you keep going, you will find another one and another one, on and on forever. There will be an infinite number of Earths that have every possible arrangement of atoms. One of those Earths will contain you but of the opposite sex, and skin color and hair color - every possible variation of you is out there somewhere. You can't say that it will stop somewhere or that it can't happen because then it wouldn't be an infinite universe. It doesn't matter if there is an infinite number of atoms - like those 10 boxes, there is not an infinite number of arrangement of those atoms. There's two things wrong with this. The first is that it assumes that the universe is infinite but that it maintains the same laws of physics, math and chemistry that exist on Earth. We do not know that either of those are true. We think that is true but we don’t know for sure. The second is that there is absolutely no possible way that we can test or confirm this by anything other than imagination and speculation..and that means it is NOT science. We might call it philosophy or a belief. We might have faith that it is true because it is logical but we cannot call it science. There is also a logical “proof” that the universe is, indeed, infinite.

For instance, they put themselves in certain locations to increase orders & to test other zones for activity, while saving gas.","output":"It’s not ethical because DoorDash typically increases pay after each declined order which means you’re declining the delivery for artificial purposes; meaning you’re not at the location to the restaurant that DoorDash is basing your pay on. You’re also imposing on a local legitimate person for scheduled hours which does have intention to completing deliveries and not decline everything just to see how busy it is. There’s no section about “GPS” in their Terms of Service, nor the Independent Contractor Agreement for the United States. What I found was [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #mtrLp] CONTRACTOR understands (i) he/she is free to select those times he/she wishes to be available on the platform to receive delivery opportunities; (ii) he/she is free to accept or reject the opportunities transmitted through the DOORDASH platform by consumers, and can make such decisions to maximize his/her opportunity to profit; and (iii) he/she has the sole right to control the manner in which deliveries are performed and the means by which those deliveries are completed.It’d be great to persuade the app developers to progress features which would make everyone more productive with more detailed order history and activity. There’s nothing efficient about the app sending you a pickup order 20 minutes away because it thinks you’re the closest driver when really you’re missing out on the order right next to you. It would be an update for delivery apps to provide a way which enables drivers to inform the algorithm that they will be traveling a particular direction and arrive in 20 minutes. It is already capable of knowing that that’s how far you are from that location. While convenient for you, it isn’t for the nearest driver that’s already there. Additionally, if the order could be prepared and ready in 10 minutes and not the 20 minutes for a driver that’s spoofing their location to think they’re the best driver for the job then there is an unnecessary wait. If food preparation times were exact and taken into account for traveling that’s already happening it could be efficient. Instead of a driver in the parking lot waiting 30 minutes for a large order it would be someone traveling to that location anyway and arrive just in time. In my experience these pickup times are not exact. Food can be ready much before or even immediately available following a ping.

One such industry that has embraced mobile apps is the online bookstore industry. With the rise of eBooks and e-readers, online bookstores have become popular, and many bookstores have shifted their focus from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online platforms. In this article, we will discuss how much it costs to develop an online bookstore mobile app. Read also: [LINKED_TEXT: Best Mobile app development companies in Bangalore] [URL: https://www.brillmindz.com/mobile-app-development-companies-in-india/] Understanding the Online Bookstore Mobile App An online bookstore mobile app is an application that allows users to purchase and read books on their mobile devices. The app provides a platform for bookstores to showcase their products, and users can browse through the store, search for books, and make purchases. Additionally, the app may include features such as book recommendations, reviews, and social sharing. App Development Platform The choice of platform for developing the mobile app will significantly affect the development cost. The two primary platforms for mobile app development are iOS and Android. The app's design is a critical factor in determining the development cost. A well-designed app with an intuitive user interface and appealing graphics will cost more than a simple app with basic features. App Features The features included in the app will also affect the cost of development. An app with advanced features such as book recommendations, social sharing, and personalized reading suggestions will cost more to develop than an app with basic features. The app may need to integrate with other systems such as payment gateways, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and shipping providers. The cost of integrating these systems will add to the development cost. Development Team The size and expertise of the development team will also affect the cost of development. Hiring a team of experienced developers will cost more than hiring a team with less experience. Based on the above factors, the cost of developing an online bookstore mobile app can range from 10,000 to 250,000 or more. The cost will depend on the complexity of the app, the features included, the app design, the app development platform, and the development team's size and expertise. Developing an app for a single platform, either iOS or Android, can cost between 10,000 to 50,000. Developing an app for both platforms can cost between 50,000 to 100,000 or more.The app's design can cost between 5,000 to 50,000 depending on the complexity and quality of the design. The cost of app features can vary depending on the complexity of the feature. Basic features such as a book catalog and shopping cart can cost between 10,000 to 20,000. Advanced features such as personalized recommendations and social sharing can cost between 50,000 to 100,000 or more.

This is changing a little bit due to operas being telecast more than they have been in the past, but overall, casting tends to be mostly color blind (unless the role specifically calls for a particular racial makeup, like the roles in Otello-but that isn't very common)and not as particular regarding the age of the singer.Opera singers are trained to make a particular type of sound/tone when singing-they don't utilize other sounds when singing. Purity of tone in the entire vocal range is paramount in opera.Acting isn't really as important as the singing-the emphasis in opera performance is on the ability to execute the difficult music well. If you are an amazing singer, but are a weak actor, that is forgiven more than the other way around.Most of, if not all of the opera is sung, not spoken. The closest opera comes to dialogue would be what is called the recitatitve-a portion of the aria that is sung like speech. It is not exactly spoken, but the rhythm and speed the recitative is performed at has the feel of speech. It takes time to get the hang of it, especially if you don't speak the language the opera is written in.Required vocal ranges for opera are much more extensive-a vocalist has to have at least two octaves of performance quality notes in order to sing the rep. Squeaking out a high C is not an option, the quality of the tone at the bottom and the top of the singer's range MUST be consistent.Opera performances are typically not miked-the singers are expected to be able to project over an orchestra without any amplification. With musicals: Singers only have to worry about one language for the most part: English.Casting is heavily dependent on the actor's look-the actor must look the role first and foremost. Whether they are the best singer for the role is a secondary consideration. This is changing somewhat with the move by directors and casting people to consider diversity in casting to give minority performers more options for performing, but it will be a long time if ever, before audiences see a black Maria for Sound of Music, or a white Bess for Porgy and Bess.Acting is more important than the singing.Singers can, and do, sing in various styles-they can sing like an opera singer (called legit singing) or they can be expected to belt (think Ethel Merman), or simply chat their way through a song without really singing it.Spoken dialogue is part of a musical-not all of the musical is usually sung.The music does not require as much of the singer technique wise, nor does it require the extended range that opera does.Musical theater singers are typically miked when they sing."},{"instruction":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","output":"i don’t know"},{"instruction":"What is the most foul smelling thing you found when cleaning out a room or closet in your house or garage?","output":"10 pound bag of rotten potatoes."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"hotflirty.comRad One day the younger twin, Akuma, found her soul mate; so the two decided to seal their love in marriage, and they made all the necessary arrangements for the great day.

Lord Vishnu then offered Sudarshan Chakra to be born on the Bhulok with his full potency. Sudarshan chakra did not want to let this oppurtunity go and so agreed to this offer. He was born as the thousand armed King Kartavirya Arjuna in the Haihayas clan. He grew upto be a great devotee of Lord Dattatreya. He received many boons including a chariot that can travel anywhere at his wish. He ruled for a long time(85000 years as per the Puranas) with justice, prosperity, valor and strength. He even defeated the mighty king of Lanka - Ravana, single handedly. Once the King happened to visit the ashram of Rishi Jamadagni and was very impressed by his celestial cow Kamdhenu. The king asked the rishi to handover the cow to him, as he belived that such a celestial cow would be more useful to a Kshatriya than a rishi dwelling in the forest and living off on alms. A conflict rose and the sons of the king had the rishi beheaded after a series of unfortunate episodes. Parshuram was the son of rishi Jamadagni. He was also a portion avatar or ansh-avatar of lord Vishnu, born with only one-forth of the potency of Lord Vishnu. He not only defeated and killed King Kartavirya Arjuna but also annihilated the earth of the Kshatriyas twenty one times. Thus Parshuram humbled the Sudarshan Chakra but also grew very angry at the current social status of the Kshatriyas and started disliking them in general.

When I was 18, I hated Thatcher like everyone of my age, but politics is about maturity, rather than a set selection of beliefs. On that basis, I'll agree with most who've answered the question that abortion has nothing to do with the state. It's a decision for women alone, real ones, with wombs! Gun rights again is about responsible use. Vermin control needs a shotgun, security and military need their tools, but Kevin, who really wants a machine gun because of his low self esteem is not something I can support. UK gun control is a bit on the strict side, but it works well enough. The last two are difficult, because they are not simple soundbite answers, and need an ability to think to get my point. So there is nothing wrong with gay marriage and it should never be prevented however, it also should not be forced on a religion that doesn't agree with it. So Adam and Steve get married in the local registry office, and that's great. But Adam and Steve want the local Catholic church to do the honours, then I'm less likely to be supportive. If (Insert crazed religion here ) want to burn gays in (made up place of doom), that's their right too! Finally, the death penalty. Its a bad idea. You can't kill someone because they killed someone, and think your murder is justified when theirs wasn't. It's a logic maze of nonsense. Killing someone is wrong, and the best punishment is to remove them from society humanely. So there you have it.

Changing all of major events like preventing the two World Wars, USSR none existent, and such would have too far-reaching effects to what end we would never know. Not to mention I myself have existed in this world due to certain event that the history have made throughout its course within the 20th century. But that does not mean that I would not want to change some small event that caused such massive devastation and destruction in this twentieth century as well know it. The very one thing that comes to my mind is the Great Leap Forward. Might you I would not do it by killing Mao Zedong or something like that for I do have a feeling and a belief that there has to have a better, more peaceful and more effective alternative solution to that problem. What I will do is this: I will go back somewhere between 1955–1957 and reminded Mao Zedong that his ideals and plans for Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution will ruin China and show him the books and various information and blueprints from the 21st century to show him how to run strong and good agricultures and industry without backyard furnace and killing sparrow thing. (Mind you not like 21st century of China today but more like 1930s Japan and 1890s Britain and France). The reason that I talk a lot about this specific event is because the Great Leap Forward is one of the world’s most deadly man made disaster and the most devastating catastrophe in the world history of the twentieth century. Besides it also badly tainted the reputation of Mao Zedong being the hero and the founder of the People’s Republic of China who had just brought order and peace to the war-torn China by overthrowing the corrupt and ineffective KMT, the warlords, Japanese puppets and other remnants that seek to restore the already overthrown imperial rule. Mao Zedong was undeniably the main Chairman of the Communist Party of China(CPC) and founded the People's Republic of China since 1949 after the Chinese Civil War that saw the exodus of the remaining KMT forces led by Chiang Kai Shek to Taiwan For a while from that time on until in the year 1958, Mao had started his own Second Five Year Plan which would be eventually be known as the Great Leap Forward in which Mao urged even greater rapid development of China's agricultural and industrial sectors. This led to massive industrialization throughout the country. Since China used to be a Agrarian Society before the CCP victory took place, many people were forced to be removed from farmlands to work in industry in which the people have no to very little experiences working with iron and steel in which the backyard furnace were established to make steel. Because Mao himself had established the CCP rule in China, Mao himself ban on private holdings of farmland and started the collectivization of everything from farming system to people’s Communes to even child and family cares. And due to the collectivization, everything that are made out of metal were to be melted down to make steel in the backyard furnace and everything that are made out of wood were to be used as fuel to the fire. The results was that almost all of the metals being made were found to be unusable and ineffective and that most of them were being left to rust. Mao also started another campaign which was called as the Four Pests Campaign(1958) in which rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows were to be eliminated. As the result from the overkill of the sparrows, there weren’t enough of them to eat the insect that killed the crops and so the famine sets in was the result. Many people died in this catastrophe as it was said (in lowest estimate) that 45 million to 50 million people have perished due to famine and those that were still hungry were resumed to eating anything to everything that moved and the remaining plant lives that have not been damaged by the bugs. There were even reports of cannibalism during that horrific era. I felt the urge to prevent that era from happening somehow IF I have a big time machine to let me return back to the past. And the past that I am talking about here is this or a few years back before it happened. I do believe that many people would have told me to just kill Mao before he could launch his CCP campaign or just alter the victory in the favorite of the KMT but I felt that both of which are way too much far-fetched and far-reaching effects to what ends we would never know or it might have leads to something even more chaotic than the “previous” timeline. Besides any highly experienced history buff from the 21st century who wanted to prevent the Great Leap Forward from happening can just simply grab as many as those already simplified Chinese translated blueprints about advanced steel and iron mill industry and creating abundances of good agriculture and make it something like the 1910s Europe and 1930s Japan in larger scale. Besides it would have been easy for advanced people in today’s world to create and to own a blueprint of creating WWII era tanks, airplanes, and battleships in any and all forms. I as one of them will show him some of the many books and instructions like this: and also show him various blueprint about how to built those: they are all in English……I wish try to find a way to translate all of these into simplified Chinese SO this would not have happened: but this will happened instead and this would not have happened and this happens instead: And because of that China could have produced something like this on its own: this: this: and this: or even this: PLUS: someday if all of those can be successful I would even show Mao this: (of course, this all needs to be simplified Chinese so Mao may understand) BUT I need to show Mao Zedong this map As for the Cultural Revolution………. (http://Revolution……….it) I do not think this would happen if there was no Great Leap Forward….. Rather if I could stay with Mao long enough, maybe I would create ….something like….a “Cultural Restoration?”"},{"instruction":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","output":"No. It is a highly risky proposition to invest in Crypto -currencies.

One common reason for the yo-yo effect is following restrictive or unsustainable diets that are difficult to maintain in the long term. When people return to their previous eating habits after finishing the diet, they often regain the weight they lost, and sometimes even more. To avoid this, it's important to follow a healthy and balanced diet that you can sustain over time. This means making gradual and sustainable changes to your eating habits, rather than following extreme or short-term diets. Similarly, it's important to have a sustainable and balanced exercise routine that you can maintain over time. Consistent exercise can help you maintain your weight by burning calories and building muscle, which can increase your metabolic rate. However, it's important to find a workout routine that you enjoy and can stick to over the long term, rather than pushing yourself too hard and risking burnout or injury. Gradually increasing your calorie intake can also help you maintain your weight, as long as you're still burning enough calories through exercise and maintaining a balanced diet. It's important to keep track of your calorie intake and to make sure you're still burning more calories than you're consuming, but not to restrict yourself too much or push yourself too hard. Overall, avoiding the yo-yo effect and maintaining your weight requires a sustainable and balanced approach to both diet and exercise. By making gradual and sustainable changes to your habits and finding a routine that works for you, you can achieve your weight goals in a healthy and sustainable way."},{"instruction":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

Volatility is measured in traditional markets by the Volatility Index, also known as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Volatility in Bitcoin does not yet have a generally accepted index since cryptocurrency as an asset class is still in its nascent stages, but we do know that Bitcoin is capable of volatility in the form of 10x changes in price versus the U.S. dollar, in a relatively short period of time. Here are just a few of the many factors behind Bitcoin's volatility: 1. Rate of adoption is hampered by bad press News events that scare Bitcoin users include geopolitical events and statements by governments that Bitcoin is likely to be regulated. Bitcoin's early adopters included several mal actors, producing headline news stories that produced fear in investors. Headline-making Bitcoin news includes the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox in early 2014 and more recently that of the South Korean exchange Yapian Youbit, and others like the high-profile use of Bitcoin in drug transactions via Silk Road that ended with the FBI shutdown of the marketplace in October 2013. All these incidents and the public panic that ensued drove the value of Bitcoins versus fiat currencies down rapidly. However, Bitcoin-friendly investors viewed those events as evidence that the market was maturing, driving the value of Bitcoins versus the dollar markedly back up in the short period immediately following the news events. 2. Bitcoin's perceived value fluctuates One reason why Bitcoin may fluctuate against fiat currencies is the perceived store of value versus the fiat currency. Bitcoin has properties that make it similar to gold. It is governed by a design decision by the developers of the core technology to limit its production to a fixed amount, 21 million BTC. Since that differs markedly from fiat currency, which is managed by governments who want to maintain low inflation, high employment, and satisfactory growth through investment in capital resources, as economies built with fiat currencies show signs of strength or weakness, investors may allocate more or less of their assets into Bitcoin. 3. Too much variance in perceptions of Bitcoin's store of value and method of value Bitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer. A store of value is the function by which an asset can be useful in the future with some predictability. A store of value can be saved and exchanged for some good or service in the future. A method of value transfer is any object or concept used to transmit property in the form of assets from one party to another. Bitcoin’s volatility at the present makes it a somewhat unclear store of value, but it promises nearly frictionless value transfer. Since these two drivers of the current spot price of Bitcoin vary against the dollar and other fiat currencies, we see that Bitcoin's value can swing based on news events much as we observe with fiat currencies. 4. Little option value to large holders of the currency Bitcoin volatility is also to an extent driven by holders of large proportions of the total outstanding float of the currency. For Bitcoin investors with current holdings above around 10M, it is not clear how they would liquidate a position that large into a fiat position without severely moving the market. Since Bitcoin’s volume resembles a small cap stock, the currency has not hit the mass market adoption rates that would be necessary to provide option value to large holders of the currency. 5. News about security breaches make investors react Bitcoin can also become volatile when the Bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes. This approach to security is paradoxically one that produces great outcomes, with many valuable open source software initiatives to its credit, including Linux. Bitcoin developers must reveal security concerns to the public in order to produce robust solutions. It was a hack that drove the Yapian Youbit to bankruptcy, while NiceHash too reported 70 million worth of Bitcoin stolen in a recent attack on the platform. In April 2014, the OpenSSL vulnerabilities attacked by the Heartbleed bug and reported by Google security's Neel Mehta drove Bitcoin prices down by 10% in a month. Bitcoin and open source software development are built upon the same fundamental premise that a copy of the source code is free for users to examine and modify at will. This concept makes it the responsibility of the community to voice concerns about the software design, and when the community does so, the value of Bitcoin reflects the level of confidence in the protocol design as a whole. It is only natural then that the value would fluctuate with news events about security breaches. 6. Bitcoin’s high profile losses at are another driver of volatility It is worth noting that these losses and the ensuing news about the losses had a double effect on volatility. They reduced the overall float of Bitcoin by approximately, producing a potential lift on the value of the remaining Bitcoin due to increased scarcity. However, overriding this lift was the negative effect of the news cycle that followed. Notably, other Bitcoin gateways looked to the massive failure at Mt Gox as a positive for the long term prospects of Bitcoin, further complicating the already complex story behind the currency’s volatility. As early adopting firms are eliminated from the market due to poor management and dysfunctional processes, later entrants learn from their errors and build stronger processes into their own operations, strengthening the infrastructure of the currency overall. 7.Bitcoin and foreign direct investment in countries with high inflation Bitcoin’s use case as a currency for the developing countries that are currently experiencing high inflation is valuable when considering the volatility of Bitcoin in these economies versus the volatility of Bitcoin in US. Bitcoin is much more volatile versus the USD than the high inflation Argentine peso versus the US. That being said, the near frictionless transfer of Bitcoins across borders makes it a potentially highly attractive borrowing instrument for Argentineans, as the high inflation rate for peso denominated loans potentially justifies taking on some intermediate currency volatility risk in a Bitcoin denominated loan funded outside Argentina. Similarly, funders outside Argentina can earn a higher return under this scheme than they can using debt instruments denominated in their home currency, potentially offsetting some of the risk of exposure to the high inflation Argentine market. 8. Tax treatment of Bitcoin also affects the volatility Recent announcements by the IRS stating that the currency is actually an asset for tax purposes had mixed effects on volatility. On the upside, any statement recognizing the currency has a positive effect on the market valuation of the currency. Conversely, on the downside, the decision by the IRS to call it property had two negative effects. The first was the added complexity for users who want to pay with it. Under the new tax law, users would have to record the market value of the currency at the time of every transaction, no matter how small. This can understandably slow adoption as it seems to be too much trouble for what it is worth for many users. Secondly, the decision to call the currency a form of property for tax purposes may be a signal to some market participants that the IRS is preparing to enforce stronger regulations later. Very strong regulation of the currency could cause the adoption rate of the currency to slow to the point where it is not able to achieve the mass adoption that is critical for its overall utility in society. Recent moves by the IRS are not clear as to their signaling motives and therefore have mixed signals to the market for Bitcoin.

Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a variety of asset classes, making them suitable for individuals with different risk tolerances and investment objectives. Here are some mutual fund themes you can consider when exploring the best ways to invest your money: Index Funds: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. These funds provide broad market exposure and generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. Index funds are an excellent option for passive investors who seek steady returns and want to track the overall market performance.Large-Cap Equity Funds: Large-cap equity funds invest in the stocks of well-established and financially stable companies with large market capitalizations. These funds focus on blue-chip companies known for their track records and stability. Large-cap equity funds offer a balance between growth potential and reduced volatility.Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Equity Funds: Mid-cap and small-cap equity funds invest in the stocks of companies with medium to small market capitalizations. These funds have the potential for higher growth but also carry higher volatility. Mid-cap and small-cap equity funds are suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance who are willing to embrace potential market fluctuations.Value Funds: Value funds invest in stocks that are considered undervalued based on various fundamental indicators, such as low price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio.

These funds typically invest in companies operating in sectors with high growth potential, such as technology, healthcare, or consumer discretionary. Growth funds are suitable for investors seeking capital appreciation over a longer time horizon.Sector-Specific Funds: Sector-specific funds concentrate their investments in a particular industry or sector, such as technology, energy, healthcare, or real estate. These funds allow investors to capitalize on the growth potential of specific sectors they believe in. However, it's important to note that sector funds can be more volatile and carry higher risks compared to diversified funds.International or Global Funds: International or global funds provide exposure to companies located outside your home country. These funds offer the opportunity to diversify geographically and gain exposure to different economies and market trends. International or global funds can enhance portfolio diversification and potentially provide higher returns.Hybrid Funds: Hybrid funds, also known as balanced funds, invest in a mix of equities and fixed-income securities. These funds offer diversification across asset classes and aim for both capital appreciation and income generation.[LINKED_TEXT: Hybrid funds] [URL: https://www.franklintempletonindia.com/funds-and-solutions/funds-explorer/hybrid-funds] can be suitable for investors seeking a balanced approach with moderate risk."},{"instruction":"Did Pfizer purposely hold back on announcing a vaccine for COVID19 in order to hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Azar says Pfizer \\"very much part\\" of Operation Warp Speed after it distanced itself from Trump program] [URL: https://www.newsweek.com/pfizer-part-operation-warp-speed-alex-azar-distanced-trump-program-1546594]"},{"instruction":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","output":"A submarine is a complex machine that operates underwater for long periods of time. One of the challenges of submarine design is how to deal with the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced by the crew and the engines. CO2 is a gas that can cause health problems and even death if it accumulates in high concentrations. Therefore, submarines need a way to remove CO2 from the air and prevent it from building up inside the vessel. There are different methods that submarines use to eliminate CO2, depending on their type and technology. Some of the most common ones are: - Scrubbers: These are devices that use chemical reactions to absorb CO2 from the air and convert it into harmless substances, such as water and sodium carbonate. Scrubbers are usually installed in the ventilation system of the submarine and require regular maintenance and replenishment of chemicals. - Electrolysis: This is a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is used to replenish the air supply, while the hydrogen is either vented out or stored for later use. Electrolysis also reduces the amount of CO2 in the air, since water is one of the products of combustion. - Carbon capture and storage: This is a technique that involves capturing CO2 from the air and storing it in a solid or liquid form, such as calcium carbonate or liquid CO2. This method requires advanced technology and large storage tanks, but it has the advantage of reducing the weight and volume of CO2 on board. These are some of the ways that submarines manage to keep their air quality safe and comfortable for their crew and passengers.

More recently, I was working in an office supplied to me by one of my clients. The State Police were pulling cars over for speeding all day and they would come into his parking lot to get the tickets. The owner was constantly yelling at and berating the officers while ordering them to stop using his parking lot for this purpose. He used his iPhone to video each encounter, and they let him get away with it. One time later in the afternoon, he forgot his iPhone, started in on them again, and the next thing you know the officers were chasing him across the parking lot, one with a gun drawn (good ol’ boys in GA - eye roll). After 5 minutes of chasing him through the woods they brought him back into the parking lot in handcuffs and took him away in one of the cruisers. The cop in charge walks over to us and I asked him what that was about. He said the owner was disrupting them as they worked. I just shook my head at him and told him, “Respectfully, there’s a lot of that going on around here, isn’t there?” He just smiled one of those “I just got owned” smiles and the cars all left. At the station, the owner was kept without having his rights read or charges pressed. He said when he was booked the cop told the front desk he was a suspected illegal from South Africa with no id (a lie) which caused him to be researched all night."},{"instruction":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","output":"There are many qualities that make a good leader, including: Vision: A good leader has a clear idea of where they want to go and can communicate that vision effectively to others.

On a personal note, I’ll get tagged periodically for some infraction or other in my answer with the generic “I have read and understood the rules” checkbox, and the problem is that it doesn’t mean sour owl shit. Sure, there are a few cases where it’s clear that I was being disrespectful but in many other cases and that’s a fair reaction, but in the vast majority of cases, what I said did not apply to the person asking the question at all (and was phrased carefully to make that clear), and the QuoraBots still got unhappy. (I have appealed these and sometimes gotten my answer restored, which suggests that my perceptions are more correct than not.)

And if you tell the school you’re planning to get police involved, they are quick to want to solve the issue. When my my son was in kindergarten, him and his brother who was in 2nd grade use to ride the bus to grandpas after school and I’d pick them up an hour later. I walked in one day to find my kindergartener pouting on the couch. Figured he’d got in trouble until my dad said “show your mom” my son was “student of the week” they send home a pig paper to fill out about your kid favorite color favorite book siblings pets etc. I’m sure you’ve seen them. A 5th grade boy on the bus had drawn penises and wrote some foul things all over it. I called the school Monday and explained why we didn’t do it. They sent home a new paper and said they would talk with the boys who had done it. 3 days later the same kid had taken my sons backpack and wouldn’t give it back. We never got the backpack back, the school said they would talk to him. The next week he took my sons shoes while on the bus and the bus driver had to get them back while 5th graders taunted him for being a crybaby about his shoes. On Friday my kindergartener got off the bus wailing and holding his face. The 5th header had punched him in the face for “tattling” my father did not wait to inform me. He loaded both kids into his truck and headed for the school. I feel like I should say, my dad is a Vietnam vet. he’s a big man and he can be very intimidating. He’s also got a booming voice that carries well. When he got to the school he was informed that there was no one available to meet with him they were in meetings. My dad loudly explained that someone would talk to him, or he’d call the sheriff to the school and report the kid to have him picked up for assault. And the kids parents could deal with the court system and that further, since the school had opted to not handle the situation, he would be pressing charges against the school and the principal personally for child neglect and endangerment. The principal made time to talk to him suddenly. She explained that there was little to be done, they didn’t have an interpreter at the school and the parents spoke very limited English. They couldn’t remove the other child from the bus because it would cause his family a hardship as neither parent could drive. My father whipped out his cellphone and called the sheriff station right there in the office. By the time the cops got to the school, the school was trying to find an interpreter and get hold of the other boys parents at the same time. The cops took a report, found a Spanish speaking officer and headed to the other boys home. Turns out the family was undocumented and it took a pretty shitty turn for that family after the police visited. I’ve used this a couple of other times also. If you tell the school you are getting the police involved, they suddenly care. Or skip telling them. If you or your child is being assaulted, you are not required to report it to the school first. You are within your rights to call the police and seek legal justice against your attacker."},{"instruction":"w do I combine Word documents into a PDF?","output":"Why bother with steps and tricks, simply use one of the online Word to PDF converter, here we suggest a few of the best and [LINKED_TEXT: 100% free online words to pdf converter] [URL: https://fileproinfo.com/tools/converter/DOCX].

Her mom called him to come back in room or he would fall sick. He didn't care about anything and kept playing there until she slapped him and took back to room. This incident reminded my childhood. I hail from a small village in my district where baisc amenities were not available before. We weren't nourished up like nowadays kids are being. There were not too much worries. We used to play together without any discrimination like don't play with this kid or don't talk to xyz kids. It wer never an issue. We used to fight a lot but at the end of day again gossiping and laughing together. We didn't know what germs are called. Whether it was first rain or stormy one, we played in it crazily. Our noises disturbed elders before frogs could break their silence. Dusk and mud were our powder and cream. We were unaware if we will fall sick or not. Even if we're sick, our legs and hands were never in control when some would be playing around us. We were beaten a lot too for committing silly and heavy mistakes. But who took it on heart if parents or someone beat us. We used to come up with new troubles very next. There were no future worrier us. It was a short glimpse of my childhood that I spent with others kids around me in my village. Now, Coming back to question. Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people? In this generation, people are more worried for their future about which they don't have any clue. They have forgotten to enjoy their beautiful present in the worrisome of delusion future. Don't eat sugar or you will be fat, avoid salt or you will be a patient of blood pressure. Stressed and depressed for intaking meals. Too many choices have left us in a doubt that what would be better for us. Our standards are more important to us than the thing we really need. Wouldn't it be a shame if I make that person my friend? Will not they mock me if I don't wear this special kind of brand and so on. We have restricted ourselves for the things which make us happy. In the name of maturity, we have made our live too tough. Such maturity is too toxic and depressing which depart us from living a peaceful live.

My Take on the Future of Crypto I am a seasoned investor and cryptocurrency enthusiast, I’ve been closely following the crypto market over the past decade. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but 2022 was undoubtedly a catastrophic year for cryptocurrencies. The market lost a staggering 2 trillion in value, and the collapse of the FTX exchange left many investors reeling. However, I believe that this year could be pivotal for the future of cryptocurrency. As companies and investors brace themselves for more scrutiny and regulation, we may see a shift towards more established institutions taking over the blockchain infrastructure. Cryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit, and the long-term outlook for the industry remains solid. So, is it worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies in 2023? Let's take a look at some top predictions to watch out for: Bear Market Will Be Over at the Beginning of 2023Some experts predict that we’re currently experiencing a crypto decline, which will probably hit its bottom by the end of 2022. These predictions are also made by the past performance of the crypto market, which suggests that in the next three months, the bear market will come to an end. It is one of the top 10 cryptocurrency predictions that investors should follow in 2023. A Lot More Investors Will Adopt BitcoinAccording to The Ascent, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, predicts that more than 500 million people worldwide will own Bitcoin by the end of 2023. The improved understanding of the industry and regulatory clarity are expected to drive greater adoption. This is one of the top 10 cryptocurrency predictions that investors should follow in 2023. Don’t Count Out NFTsNFTs were all the rage in 2022, and despite the market downturn, they are expected to recover next year. Brands will continue to flock to NFTs, and we may see major investments from both Web2 and Web3 brands, such as Starbucks and Disney. The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Get ApprovedSome crypto investors predict that the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could be approved this year, giving investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency itself. The market is now large and mature enough to support it, and analysts believe that a Bitcoin Spot ETF will be approved. Ether Will Outperform Bitcoin AgainEther outperformed Bitcoin in 2021, gaining 418 percent compared to 66 percent for Bitcoin. Analysts believe that ether will continue to do well because of the surge in NFT sales volumes. Most of these tokens still run on the ethereum blockchain. Despite these predictions, it's important to remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and risky investments. It’s essential to do your research and invest only what you can afford to lose. If you're new to cryptocurrency investing, it's best to start with small amounts and gradually build up your portfolio. In the world of cryptocurrency, security is a top concern for investors. With the rise of cyberattacks and exchange hacks, investors are becoming increasingly wary of keeping their digital assets on platforms that are not secure enough. This is where BTCC comes in. BTCC is a cryptocurrency exchange that has proven to be one of the most secure platforms for trading digital assets. With its robust security protocols and advanced encryption technology, BTCC has never suffered a major security breach since its establishment. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow in 2023, investors will be looking for a reliable and secure platform to buy and sell their digital assets. This is where BTCC will shine. Its reputation for security will make it a popular choice among investors who want to ensure their assets are safe from cyber threats. In conclusion, while the past year has been a tough one for cryptocurrencies, I believe that the industry will regroup in 2023, with those still standing ready for a big push heading into 2024. The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, but it's clear that cryptography and blockchains will continue to shape the modern economic landscape. Whether it's worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies is up to each individual investor to decide."},{"instruction":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","output":"QUESTION : Is Bangladesh a far more prosperous country than Pakistan?

I'm gonna tell you about a path that one should follow in order to become good at competitive programming but again remember one thing there is no such magic involved in it. It includes a lot of dedicated hard work and most importantly consistency. The biggest problem that everyone faces while seeing these competitive programming questions is people will freeze out immediately and thinks that they are not made for it probably they are not good programmers or probably they might think that their ability is not that high. There is a very big reason why you're thinking out like that why you're freezing out like that now let's do a fun experiment just imagine this situations take-up any student from fifth or sixth standard who is good at science teach him the laws of motion and the equation of laws of motion now take that student and give him JEE Mains paper of that which includes the question from these laws of motion what he's going to feel in those questions he's going to feel that Even though he knows these laws of motion still not able to crack down these questions as they are based on the same concept so he's going to feel that there is something wrong with him probably he is not smart enough but we all know that the problem is not about the smartness the problem is he just knows that syntax of that equation(formulas) he was never prepared gradually to crack down those tough levels of questions Coming to competitive programming it is happening the same when you see the questions on CodeChef, Codeforces, Atcoder, etc If you are unable to solve them exactly the same is happening just like the above situation Just by knowing the programming syntax and some basic loops and functions and seeing those questions which are really tough we are getting fries out and questioning our capability The most important thing that one should learn while solving questions is that they should move gradually so that you can crack down those problems. HOW TO GET STARTED WITH COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING ?? 1)Learn one language perfectly Taking any language would be fine but I personally suggest going with C++ because C++ contains STL which has built-in functions and these functions are fast compared to other programming built-in functions mostly many editorials and solutions of competitive coding contests are in C++. Even If you have started with another programming language it’s fine. C++ is faster than other programming languages in producing the results which are a plus for competitive coders. 2)Choose one platform to practice questions Keep solving easy-level problems first and then keep on leveling up. Some best platforms are as follows TopCoderCoderbyteHackerearthCodeChefCode studio 3)Participate in contests Many platforms keep conducting contests so try to participate in those contests. Don’t do contests for ratings Do contests to improve your skills. Some best platforms are as follows CodestudioTopCoderCoderbyteHackerearthCodeChefCodeforcesAtcoder Never worry about ratings do remember only one thing that you are solving questions to improve your skills. If a person is a self-learner then he/she can do above all things. If a person is unable to learn or unable to solve even after learning things then he/she must need a guide I personally suggest going with the CODING NINJAS competitive programming course WHY CODING NINJAS??

It's time to address a common misconception that has hindered many women from embracing their full potential: the notion that low testosterone levels make it impossible to build muscle. Today, we're going to debunk this myth, turn it on its head, and show you how to sculpt that gorgeous physique you've always dreamed of, all while having a good laugh along the way. So, let's dive right into the world of female muscle buildin! Hitting the Weights: Overcoming Low Testosterone Alright, ladies, let's address the elephant in the room: testosterone. Traditionally seen as the almighty hormone responsible for muscle growth, it's often portrayed as the secret ingredient to Hulk-like gains. But let me ask you this: does having a low testosterone level mean you can't build muscle? Absolutely not! Let's put it in perspective. Imagine you're hosting a potluck dinner. The star of the show is usually the main course, right? Well, in the world of muscle building, testosterone may be considered the main course, but that doesn't mean the side dishes (other hormones) can't shine. While women typically have lower testosterone levels than men, they have their own secret sauce called estrogen, which plays a significant role in muscle preservation and growth. Estrogen: The Hidden Hero Estrogen, often seen as the \\"feminine\\" hormone, deserves a standing ovation for its muscle-building prowess. Like a well-orchestrated dance routine, estrogen teams up with other hormones, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to promote muscle protein synthesis and enhance recovery. So, even with lower testosterone levels, ladies, you've got an ace up your sleeve! But wait, there's more! Estrogen helps maintain bone health, which is essential for overall strength and stability. It's like having a solid foundation for a beautiful house. You can't build a sturdy structure without a strong base, and estrogen ensures your skeletal system is ready to support the muscle gains you'll achieve. Train Smart: The Magic of Resistance Training Now that we understand the hormonal dynamics, let's talk about the most important tool in your muscle-building arsenal: resistance training. Picture this: you're driving a car, and resistance training is the gas that fuels your journey to muscular glory. With a well-designed workout plan, you can rev up your engine and unlock your true potential. When you engage in resistance training, whether it's with weights, resistance bands, or your body weight, you create micro-tears in your muscle fibers. These tears act as a signal to your body, prompting it to repair and strengthen the damaged tissue. Over time, with consistent training and proper nutrition, your muscles adapt and grow stronger, defying the limits imposed by testosterone levels. Nutrition: Fueling Your Inner Fire Now, ladies, let's talk about feeding the fire within. Just like a car needs the right fuel to keep running smoothly, your body needs proper nutrition to support muscle growth. But before you start picturing chicken breasts and broccoli for every meal, let's get one thing straight: you don't have to eat like a Spartan warrior to build muscle. Instead, focus on consuming a well-rounded diet that includes lean protein sources like chicken, fish, tofu, or beans. Carbohydrates provide the energy needed to power through those intense workouts, so don't shy away from healthy options like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. And let's not forget about the good fats! Avocados and nuts can provide essential nutrients for hormone production and overall health. Remember, building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. It's important to listen to your body and give it the rest and recovery it needs. Adequate sleep, hydration, and stress management are crucial elements of the muscle-building equation. So, don't be afraid to pamper yourself and prioritize self-care along the way. You deserve it! Unleash Your Inner Wonder Woman Ladies, it's time to shatter the myth that low testosterone levels can hold you back from building muscle. Embrace your unique hormonal balance, leverage the power of resistance training, nourish your body with proper nutrition, and cultivate a mindset of unwavering belief in your abilities. Now, go forth, conquer, and flex on, my strong and fearless queens! You've got this!

Friendship can be a real safety net in times where you have no spouse, your parents don’t understand you because of the generational differences, your children might have gone away and create their own life. In a deeper, more spiritual sense, friendship is a mirror of how well we really communicate with people, with those we don’t share the sexual attraction, the money, the same family name with. Basically, we are completely independent from them in a material world. But can we bond with people more spiritually?

Bhagat Singh belongs to Indian Sanatana Satanana Sanatani Hindu Sikh Sri Vaishnava Khatri Kshatri Kshatriya community to which all the ten Indian Hindu Sikh Sri Vaishnava Gurus such as Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Ram Dev, Guru Kishan Dev, Guru Arjun Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Tegbahadur, Guru Harkishan Dev, Guru Harigovind Dev, and Guru Gobind Singh belong. Khatris and Agarwals: Two Foremost Indian Hindu Kshatriya Vaishya communities of India Khatris are Kshatriyas who are descendants of Ayodhya Sri Ram, the former rulers and empire builders of India, the group to which all the Ten Sikh Gurus, including the founder Guru Nanak who undertook a Haj pilgrimage to Kaba in Saudi Arabia just as the most orthodox and conservative Muslims do, Guru Ramsingh, who built the holiest Hindu cum Sikh temple called Sri Hari Mandir Saab Temple in Amritsar, which is now called as Golden Temple because the greatest Sikh Emperor Maharaja Ranji Singh provided a golden cover to Sri Hari Vishnu Devalaya Temple in Amritsar, Guru Tegbahadur who was burnt alive by the Turish Mongolian Iranian Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb because Guru Tegbahadur did not accept to convert from his Sikh Hindu religion to Islam; and Guru Gobind Singh whose three sons were buried under the walls by the Mughal Emperor for fighting for his Sikh Hindu religion, Sikh Hindu, and other Hindu men, women, and children of India. Once the British destroyed the Sikh Hindu Empire by defeating the Sikh Hindu kingdom, Khatris lost much of their status, power, and money, and since they had to take to commerce and trade as the British and Indian princely states did not deliberately or due to the fear of incurring the enmity of the Briitsh, Khatris were also treated as belonging to Vaishya caste. So, the Veer Dheer Shoor Kshatriya Khatris, the pride of all Hindus, including Sikh Hindus of India, and the true patriots of India, are now also called as Kshatriya Vaishya community, in the same as Agarwals, the true Kshatriyas of India, the former rulers of India, the descendants of Ayodhya Sri Ram, and empire builders of India, who lost their empires to the invading Muslim rulers from Afghanistan, Iran (also known as Persia), Khazakstan, Uzbekistan, and Arab countries and later to the European British, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Dutch Roman Catholic and Protestant Christian colonizer rulers of India, took to business, commerce, and trade, and became known as Kshatriya Agarwals, or Kshatriya Vaishya Agarwals of India, who are found throughout northern, central and western India, mainly in the states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Bansals, Kejriwals, Bansalis, Kucchals, Kansals, Goels, Goyals, Goyans, Gargs, Mittals, Jindals, Dharans, Singhals, Tingals, Tayals, Mangals, Bhandals, Nagals, Airans, and Madhukuls are the different groups of Indian Hindu Kshatriya Vaishya Sri Vaishnava men, women, and children belonging to the Agarwal Kshatriya Vaishya community of India. Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Admi Party founder and president Arvind Kejriwal and Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the foremost national leaders of India’s Freedom Movement are some of the big names of the Indian Hindu Kshatriya Vaishya Sri Vaishnava Agarwal community of India.

This can potentially shift your body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. However, it's important to approach the keto diet safely and mindfully. Here's how you can incorporate the keto diet for rapid weight loss: Carbohydrate Restriction: Limit your daily carbohydrate intake to a very low level, typically around 20-50 grams per day. This forces your body to rely on fat stores for energy.High Fat Intake: Increase your consumption of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. These fats will provide the majority of your daily calorie intake.Moderate Protein: Consume moderate amounts of protein from sources like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy. Excessive protein intake can potentially interfere with ketosis, so it's important to balance it.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and support your body's adaptation to ketosis.Limit Processed Foods: While the focus is on fats, it's still essential to choose whole, minimally processed foods to ensure you're getting essential nutrients.Plan Meals Carefully: Create a meal plan that aligns with keto guidelines.

The procedure of removing stubborn fat from areas of the body that have not responded to diet or exercise is called lipo, lipectomy, or lipoplasty.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"instruction":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","output":"Physical violence being betrayed by the one who you live and thought was on your side is devastating, devastating to learn they put a target on your back, put you down by obfuscating context, like you’re larking around having fun, the other half presents it to her friends as a source of ridicule.

These are the opening words for the Spanish novel “El Capitán Alatriste”, the first of a series of novels that tell the story of Diego Alatriste y Tenorio, a Spanish soldier in the decaying Spanish Empire of the XVII century. The line is perfect, in that it tells you almost everything you need to know about the character. He wasn’t the most honest, meaning he was willing to be a little shady, but he wasn’t entirely dishonest. He wasn’t the most merciful, but he sometimes acted with mercy. But whatever the case, he was brave beyond doubt. This is a perfect description of the character of Captain Alatriste (who, by the way, is no captain at all, just a plain soldier, but he was so brave in battle, that they gave him the moniker “Captain” and everyone calls him that way… even his superior officers!). He struggles through the hardships of life of a retired soldier in a decaying Empire, while trying to make a living and at the same time taking care of the son of one of his best friends in the army, who died in the arms of the Captain and made him promise to take care of his son.

Even at the peak of its empire called the USSR, it claimed it was a power solely based upon the military it couldn’t afford, and the nukes it could threaten to destroy others with. The main problem it had was having to work SO hard to keep its citizens in-country and working for the common good. They wasted a LOT of money trying to control everything in and around Russia, money that was easily “lost” and placed in some guy’s pockets so HE could have a marginally better life: To “H” with everyone else. Corruption and lack of personal investment in Russia was, and is, rampant, endemic, part of everyday life in Russia. That limits their ability to grow as a power immensely. The Russians I’ve worked with over the years — we have a fairly large Russian community— were dedicated and hard-working (in the US), but had just “skated by” in Russia because there was no benefit in excelling. THAT makes a world of difference and dooms Russia to remain a 3rd-class power unless and until Russians really get behind the idea of excelling at whatever they do.

It’s quite common for babies to have minor skin problems from birth: dry skin, redness, irritation, bumps, diaper rash. Many children go through all these stages. So if you thought babies had flawless skin, you’re probably feeling a little distraught! Since newborn skin is especially fragile, parents are quick to seek the best products to minimize these small skin problems. But what exactly does your child need? How can you choose the best products for your little one? And most importantly, what can we really find in the formulas of baby products available on the market? Since delicate baby skin loses moisture more quickly than adults and its protective layer does not renew itself as quickly, many parents are looking for ultra-gentle, perfume-free, hypoallergenic products specially formulated for a newborn’s epidermis. However, none of the parents in our survey said they looked at the product label, namely because it’s difficult to make sense of the ingredient list. Products aimed specifically at babies are not necessarily the best for their skin and health. They may contain ingredients that are just as concerning as those found in household products and personal care products for adults. The many ingredients of concern found in most [LINKED_TEXT: baby products] [URL: https://funfamilygeneral.shop/] can penetrate their delicate skin’s natural protective barrier and be easily absorbed into their body.

They are pretty universal & not limited to an INFJ personality. We are prone to being overly analytical to the point of despair & ennuie. Our penchant to dive deep into our subconscious mind & obtuse philosophical concepts can lead to some pretty stark & angst ridden realizations. It's important for us to climb out of the cave to “look out & smell the roses\\" every so often. I'm one who's guilty of descending so far into the abyss, releasing all the monsters from the proverbial hell within. Now, they're intimate pals I occasionally let out if they behave. I've come a long way. Hobbies that give us the time & focus to sort out the weird maze & landscape of our internal life are truly beneficial. Things like: Journaling - or any writing pursuit (Answering questions on Quora?)Engaging in (or learning new) artistic creative disciplines or criticism: painting, music, creative writing, photography, etc. Taking up a new musical instrument.(even just partaking at a museum or going to the symphony) I volunteered as an art docent for several years.Some use digital media for therapeutic effect. Like coding, or minecraft. I had a H.S. algebra teacher who claimed she would do quadratic equations in the evenings because she enjoyed the puzzle of it??? (I don't think she was an INFJ.) Taking part in activities that get us out in nature where we can release pent up anxiety & stressors. The science is bountiful on exercise being good for stress reduction i.e. lower blood pressure, circulation, cortisol reducing-mood stabilization, weight loss, the list goes on. Probably going solo giving us time to ourselves & to recharge our batteries from the overwhelm we commonly experience is better suited to our personality for therapeutic effect. Activities include: Running, cycling & hiking, rock-climbing, GeocachingYoga, martial-arts, hip-hop dance classesSwimming, rowing, canoeingArchery Team sports are also good, but they won't have the rejuvinating effect of more individualistic activities. Having addressed the body, addressing the mind is essential as well: Learning & practicing meditation in a form that suits us.Reading about philosophical & psychological theories. These are broad subjects that can pique certain interests in physics & metaphysics, ethics, law, economy, ecology, etc. Listening to audio books or podcasts about these subjects.If your religous, really engaging in the moralistic & spiritual aspects of your religion. Opening up to other religious viewpoints to enhance your own. If you're atheistic, delving into science & the philosophies of skepticism & epistemology works much the same way.Read, read… & read some more! You can never learn too much. Of course we can find things that kill two birds. We of all people know that the mind-body problem is just a convienient illusion.

And yes, before anyone asks, I’m willing to pay a little more also. I’m perfectly willing to go back to Bill Clinton’s taxation rates, which gave us a nice budget surplus. And, we can raise the corporate tax rate back up, and the taxes wealthy people must pay. Our economy boomed under these tax rates in the 90s. Let’s wind down the wars—which Obama started to do. That’s a vast expense too. We spend more on the military than the next several nations combined. I’m sure we would be just fine if we only spent more than the next highest. Funny—Republicans never ask how they are going to pay for their massively expensive multi-trillion dollar wars and their grossly inflated military spending, and their tax cuts for the wealthy (yes, those have to be paid for somehow too). They don’t ask how we pay for it when it comes to killing people—only when we spend money on helping people—then, it’s “gee, how can we afford this?”"},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"Before I gave birth to my youngest child, I as working in a high pace, high stress position. I had been full time there for years, with tons of experience, great work ethic, and even did an extra “job” within the job that no one else wanted to do. I’m what I would call an exemplary employee. I work for a very large company, and my position is held in many different areas of the company. When I got pregnant, I had scaled back to ‘as needed’, because I could no longer meet the full time demands, which included working 24 hour shifts and 50–60 hour work weeks, weekends, etc. In that, I WANTED to work full time and did maintain full time hours for a period of time, but being classified as ‘as needed’, I lost ALL my benefits, including the over 200 hours of extended sick leave I had earned over 5 and a half years of employment. I knew if I went back full time within 1 year, I would get my 200 hours back, which I needed in order to have paid maternity leave… I applied for a transfer to a better department, which had a much better schedule, more relaxed work environment, and no weekend/overnight requirements. My application for transfer was ignored for WEEKS, while the position remained open. I called the HR recruiter over that department multiple times, and my calls were ignored. I finally went above her, inquiring why I hadn’t been selected for an interview. I just wanted to know why… I was called about 24 hours later for an interview and was told that the hiring manager wasn’t ‘motivated’ to hire, but I was given an interview. I wasn’t selected. At that point, I was about 4 months pregnant, and it was noticeable. I can only assume that’s why I didn’t get selected, because the hiring manager told me to let her know right away if I wanted the job and I responded the same day that I wanted it, but wasn’t selected. The job was taken down and reposted less than 2 days later. Fast forward to 6 months after I gave birth. I had no paid maternity leave, had to quit my job so I could cash out my 401k just to have something to subsidize our income while I was off work. We were in a really bad position financially. I started looking for a new job, and still needed something that worked better for a young family. When I was on line looking, I saw the SAME job posted again. What irony. Still hadn’t filled that position? Or the last hire didn’t work out? I took a stab in the dark, applied for the job, and got called THE NEXT DAY. I interviewed, and was offered the job 2 hours later. Nothing had changed on my end. I still had the same amount of experience, same education, etc. I’ve been here 4 months now, and I’ve joked with my manager about how she could have had me this whole time. She says she doesn’t even remember interviewing me… .You never know what will happen, but if you want something, you should go after it."},{"instruction":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule?

With that said, there are a few things to note: Logistically, it’d be impossible to take everyone’s guns (it seems even some Americans forget just how damn big our country is)No legislation has been passed or brought to a vote that intends to take gunsLegislation has been brought to a vote and/or passed to limit the availability of guns & gun types, who can purchase them (i.e., prohibiting felons, those with mental health issues, domestic abusers, etc.), and where guns may be taken A lot of the above has already been enacted but usually poorly enforced. In some areas (mostly red states) the laws have been reduced over the years to allow weapons in more people’s hands quickly (see Texas as an example by removing 200+ million to screen for and support mental health despite Gov. Abbotts’s promises to the opposite) and allow them broader range of where they may take them (churches, bars, etc.). If anything, recent years have put guns in more hands than not. If people actually paid attention instead of watching scare-tactic TV shows they might see that and stress less about people coming to get their guns and worry that there are some seriously unstable people out there with guns that otherwise would have been prevented to have them. Just because this issue and the amount of ignorance of gun owners to want to abide by any sort of sensible precaution, it’s fun to point out that guns are the leading cause of death for school children in Texas now and more than 2/3 of women killed in relationships are due to gun violence (this is a nod to the domestic abuser note in #3 which was a law that got repealed in some states and stopped from being enacted in others). All the above aside, there are notes about other countries where guns have either been severely regulated (see most Nordic countries) or severely limited/removed altogether (Australia, New Zealand, England, etc.) yet I don’t see any of those countries dropping into anarchy or totalitarian regimes. In truth, it looks like those countries where the guns flow freely tend to skew more towards anarchy (just take a look right here in the good ‘ol US of A), especially when guns and religion are mixed."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"Best freelancing sites are: 1.

Leasing is a fantastic option, but is not for everyone. Leasing a car is the most flexible way to buy a car. Let’s dig in. When you lease a car, it presents three options you would not have if you were going to lock yourself into a 60 or 72 month loan purchasing a vehicle. At the end of the lease you have the option to turn it in, and walk away. This is great if you are the type of person who gets tired of vehicles before the loan is satisfied, or you are not sure what your future looks like. Let me be more specific, let’s say you want this nice fancy coop but are not sure if you will be having a baby in the near future or your needs will change in someway. This is good because if you were to get involved with a 60 or 72 month loan, if three years later you hate the car or are tired of it, you would be very much upside down on this loan and have a hard time trading it without negative equity. Leasing eliminates this. The second major point is, if you continually lease a vehicle you will always have a vehicle with the newest technology in it, and always have a vehicle under warranty. Although you will always have a payment, you will never be responsible for major repairs. The third point is, if you are after a payment, you will be able to lease a vehicle significantly less monthly than a loan on the vehicle. In most cases with minimal cash down, you will be in a lease for the same money monthly that you would be with substantially more money down in a 60 month loan. I would say those are some pretty good pros to leasing, but there are definitely cons, and leasing is definitely not for everyone. Let’s take a look at why. If you are unsure of how many miles per year you drive or are not confident in safely overestimating how many miles leasing could be very bad for you if you go over miles substantially. If you were the person that tends to keep their vehicle for a very long time and have the intention of leasing the vehicle but in the back your head me know deep down you will most likely buy out the lease, it is almost never advantageous to do this because you’ll in most cases be able to find a used car identical to yours with lower miles perhaps even a year newer and with more equipment for what the residual or buy out on your lease is."},{"instruction":"Would you ever wear a Rolex submariner with a suit and/or blazer?","output":"Funny question as this is exactly what Rolex did to promote the Submariner! Have a look at this vintage ad below : On my side, I would add that the coolest thing with the Submariner is precisely its versatility. You can literally wear it on any occasion. T shirt, jeans, blazer, suit, under the shower, while diving, naked! It will always work! There are so little watches where this is actually true and its one of the reasons why this watch is considered as an icon. Personally, I like to break the formal look of a suit with a sportier watch and play on that contrast. This works pretty well, especially when you are quite young. Hey you know what?

Pretty messed up age. What all I am going to share is not just for a 17 year old girl but every girl irrespective of the age and maturity. Don’t compare yourself and don’t let others compare you. We have the tendency to look beautiful and compare ourselves with some celebs. I ask you why? Everyone’s life and situation is different. They are getting paid for being beautiful. If you leave your studies and the job you are doing and have lots of money, trust me you might look better than them. But you can’t! You have responsibilities to carry. Accept yourself the way you are to avoid that mental stress. Don’t feel insecure about looks. While I shared a picture of mine in an ethnic wear, I mentioned I am dusky, average looking girl and too photogenic and the picture I am sharing is filtered. A girl messaged thanking me for making me accept herself completely. So what if I am dusky? So what if I am short. Big deal? I need the world to know I am dusky and average looking. Why? Because my beauty lies in the confidence I carry, the smile I wear, the kind heart I have, the attitude of not giving up I pursue, and the aspirations I hold. It makes me beautiful. People will come and go, judge you with your clothes and look, but the one who will love you, will love you even when you lose all your teeth and your memory in old age! Remember that. Just try to change your flaws and try being nice. DON’T body-shame any girl/guy EVER! People mostly say that a girl is jealous of another girl and to some extent it’s true. Most of us try to portray a good image in front of men by portraying other girls bad and mean and by trolling their looks. This should be a big NO! Never be jealous of any girl. Also never demean any girl. There are people whom I know of have the tendency not to compliment girls. Change it! Trolling friends by addressing them with cute names as “Moti” and “Patli” is okay till it’s fun and should not be exaggerated. Don’t run behind trying to find a right guy. Take your time. Things happen automatically. No one knows the future. Be someone who understands what life is all about and certainly it’s not always about the “Guy”. Be ambitious. Be cautious. Be fierce and be simple. A girl with ambitions and trying to achieve one is the sexiest! Don’t ever get intimate with someone you don’t love/ Someone who doesn’t feel for you if you are emotional People wanted me to hook up casually after my break up. I knew it would destroy me since I am a very emotional person who believes in love. Being vulnerable makes you do stupid things which you will always regret later. Try to stay away from things that might hurt you in future. Don’t trust anyone who suddenly becomes close to you after your breakup because you never know your weakness. Don’t think it’s too late for you to pursue a different career Girls have the tendency to think that it’s time to marry else they won’t get any eligible groom after 25. They even continue with that career they are not interested because who has time to switch? Nope! Please do it. Situations might not have allowed you to pursue something you wanted but there is always a time you can go for it. Even I am doing PhD for the sake of stability. Marriage can wait, the right groom can wait but not your dreams. Don’t betray men! Or don’t let the man betray you. Falling in love is easy but maintaining that love comes from within. If someone loves you, love them back with the same passion if you are in a relationship. If you feel like the luster is lost, it’s better to let go of the relationship by mutual consent and talks. But yes, don’t dump or ditch a person without any explanation! Everyone deserves an explanation. It makes one go mad thinking about the reason of being dumped. Be true to your relationship or never be in one! Also, the day you realize you are being cheated, let go of that toxic relationship and feel happy about it.

It involves various techniques and strategies that are implemented directly on the web page to make it more search engine-friendly and user-friendly. The goal of on-page SEO is to ensure that search engines understand the content and context of the page, which helps improve its ranking in search results for relevant keywords and phrases. Key components and techniques of on-page SEO include: Keyword Optimization: Researching and selecting relevant keywords that users might use to find your content. Incorporating these keywords naturally in the page's title, headings, content, meta descriptions, and URLs.Quality Content: Creating high-quality, informative, and valuable content that addresses the needs of the target audience. Ensuring the content is well-structured with appropriate headings and subheadings.Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Writing compelling and relevant title tags and meta descriptions that accurately represent the content of the page. Keeping these tags within recommended character limits.Header Tags (H1, H2, etc.):Using header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure the content and highlight important sections. Including relevant keywords in these header tags.URL Structure: Creating clear and descriptive URLs that reflect the content of the page. Avoiding long, complex URLs with unnecessary parameters.Internal Linking: Linking to other relevant pages within your website to provide context and improve navigation. Using descriptive anchor text for internal links.Image Optimization: Optimizing images by using descriptive filenames and alt text to help search engines understand the content of the images.Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensuring that the web page is responsive and displays well on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.Page Speed and Load Time: Optimizing the page's loading speed by minimizing code, using compressed images, and leveraging browser caching.Schema Markup: Implementing schema markup (structured data) to provide additional context to search engines about the content, such as reviews, events, products, and more.User Experience (UX):Creating a positive user experience with easy navigation, readable fonts, and a clean design. Reducing bounce rates by delivering relevant and engaging content.Canonical Tags: Using canonical tags to indicate the preferred version of a page if there are multiple versions with similar content.Optimized URLs and Permalinks: Using short, descriptive, and keyword-rich URLs that are easy to read and share. On-page SEO is a foundational aspect of search engine optimization and plays a crucial role in helping search engines understand your content and rank it appropriately. When combined with off-page SEO (external factors like backlinks and social signals) and technical SEO (site structure, indexing, etc.), on-page SEO contributes to improving your website's overall search engine visibility and organic traffic. Certainly, here are a few more advanced concepts and techniques related to on-page SEO: Keyword Variations and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI):Beyond using exact-match keywords, incorporating related keyword variations and LSI keywords can enhance the content's relevancy and appeal to both search engines and users.Content Length and Depth: IN some cases, longer and more comprehensive content can rank better. Creating in-depth, authoritative content can attract backlinks and establish your website as an authoritative source.Content Optimization: Optimizing content not just for search engines but for users too.

Let’s try one interpretation. For definiteness, let’s imagine we are trying to compress a black and white picture which we’ll put up as a bunch of pixels/cells on our Game of Life board. How would we “use the game of life” to compress that picture? Well, we want to end up with either exactly that picture (lossless compression) or something close (lossy compression). We start with a blank array of pixels/cells and somehow “supply” the compressed value to it. Since the Life rules are set, all we can supply is instructions to set or clear any cell. We could either set up the initial values immediately, or we could do something more sequential, where we put down some set of initial cells, let Life run for some number of steps, then put down more cells, and so on. Now, clearly we could simply put down the exact picture and not run Life at all. That “works” but doesn’t do any compression. Or we could do the same thing but put down a JPEG compression of the image. That compresses but rather misses the point of the question. It would be nice if we could find some precursor state of the picture which is significantly smaller than the picture itself, but will evolve to it (or to some good approximation of it) over time. We could do a brute force search - start with the picture, consider every possible predecessor state, then for each of those every possible predecessor state, and so on. Keep going until either (a) there is no possible predecessor state, in which case we lose; or (b) we find a predecessor which is significantly smaller than what we started with, in which case we win. How often we get stuck due to (a) - and whether we can fix that by throwing away some details of the original, i.e., making the compression lossy - isn’t clear - but I’d guess it happens fairly often. Now, this is one plausible interpretation of “using the Game of Life.” Since the Game of Life is Turing-universal, we could instead use it to simulate a Turing machine and then run on it any compression algorithm we like. Done. That’s the problem with looking for solutions “using” some technique: It’s not a well-defined concept. I’m guessing this question was inspired by old ideas of using fractals for compression. Since simple fractal formulas can produce extremely detailed, highly complex, sets, it seems “obvious” to start with a detailed, highly complex set - like a photograph - and “work backwards” to a short formula that will evolve into it. There were tons of claims of success in doing this, but I haven’t heard much about this in years. The problem is that “work backwards” step doesn’t seem to generalize in any useful way. As Alan Perlis once put it: A picture is worth a thousand words; but few (meaningful) groups of a thousand words correspond to a nice picture."},{"instruction":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","output":"Creating your own website or blog on WordPress is relatively easy.

Palmyra Tender Nut. More commonly known as Palm fruit, or “நுங்கு” in Tamizh, it is the fruit from the palm tree. Every fruit normally contains three pods inside its shell. The pods inside are filled with juice on the inside, much like coconut and its water. And the tricky thing is, you’ve got to peel the white outer layer to taste the bliss within. Sure, there are a few gods I know who can swallow it whole, but I prefer it without the outer skin, as the bitterness obscures most of the taste. The peeled skin can be put to other uses, too. It makes a great face mask. But time is of the essence during this process. The more time the fruit remains outside, the harder it becomes, and it is useless to eat the fruit if it has lost all its slippery softness. The contributor to the most amount of mess is the water inside the fruit. I’ve never succeeded in drinking the water without spilling. It tastes sweet, but the struggle undergone to acquire it often makes me wonder if it is worth it. Coming to the “civilized” part, I don’t think anyone looks terribly dignified while slurping the water out of the fruit or peeling it without making themselves sticky all over. And I know I look like a kindergartner who’s been force-fed his lunch by his grumpy mum by the time I finish eating three fruits. Nandri!"},{"instruction":"ello!

The hydrant was blue and I thought it was a paranoid homeowner who installed a private fire hydrant for his own use. There were no red lines or signs saying no parking.","output":"Not parking within a certain distance of a hydrant is statutory in most places. (It’s written laws and no signs or lines have to be there.) Let’s say the law where you are is 15 feet, and you parked 14 feet, 9 inches from the hydrant, you could plead guilty (you were) with an explanation - that you don’t normally carry a tape measure with you, and it looked to be at least 15 feet when you parked. That might reduce the fine, or even get it suspended. (3 inches isn’t going to make much difference to the firefighters hooking up to the hydrant. But if you parked right in front of it? I’d still plead guilty with an explanation, and just say that you weren’t aware that hydrants could be any color but red (or yellow, or whatever is common there), so you thought it was some homeowner trying to guarantee himself a parking space - and you’ve been educated now. You’ll still pay, but the judge might lessen the fine a bit. But don’t try to plead not guilty if you were within 5 feet or so of the hydrant. If you can’t tell the difference between even 10 feet and 15 feet you shouldn’t be driving. And if you’re guilty beyond any doubt (which you would be if you were within a few feet of it), nothing you say can make you not guilty. (The only case I’ve ever seen of someone “beating” a fire hydrant ticket was one in which a cardiac surgeon saw a man dropping from a serious coronary infarction while he was passing the scene. [He was a cardiac surgeon - he knew the difference between “he’s having chest pains” and “he’s about to die” even at 10 feet.] He started to perform external cardiac massage [and went further - I won’t get gory], and kept it up in the ambulance that eventually got the victim to the hospital. Oops - when he stopped, it was about 2 feet from a hydrant. He came back later to find a summons on the car. He pled guilty with an explanation. [He was guilty.] The judge dismissed the charge and apologized, on behalf of the city, for having wasted the doctor’s time.

Most cup and core bullets are formed from flat copper cookies punched out of flat ribbons. They look like featureless pennies. They go through a series of punches to form cups that lead alloy pellets are pressed into. They then go through several other dies that create the point. Its very difficult to make a die with a sharply tapered precisely pointed hole to form a tip. To get a sharp point either requires a bullet to be machined or a special tip inserted and bonded to to the front of the bullet. Machining tiny sharp points is somewhat difficult because as you get to the sharper portion the material is thinner and tends to ride up onto the cutting tool. This requires that cuts be made in small increments which means time consuming. Time is money in any manufacturing. Lead cannot be formed into sharp points because its too soft. Another factor is how bullets are stabilized. When you take a long sharp point you change the center of gravity and it can cause yaw from its center axis. In an exaggerated sense picture throwing a baseball bat while holding the large end. The bat will want to wobble and flip. On the other hand throw a football. The football is more stable in flight. There has to be a balance. A new bullet recently introduced is the Hornady A-tip. It is very long and and sleek and fairly pointed. They get away with this design because a good portion of the front is aluminum. The tips are much lighter than the material farther back so it has a well balanced center of gravity. The point helps with its aerodynamic drag. They are very expensive. Usually around a dollar per projectile. The last factor I'll throw out is that narrow tips take a beating in the loading process going from magazine to chamber. Soft, narrow tips are easily bent traveling up and into a chamber. Semi-auto and automatic firearm loading is generally considered a violent mechanical manuever.

Even so, enough people are convinced that states representing 165 electors (of the 270 required for a majority) have already signed onto a compact obligating them to essentially move to a popular vote once 270 electors sign on: [LINKED_TEXT: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact] Even more so than most countries, rural parts of the US are at war with the urban.

And I’m only slightly exaggerating when I say war, since it has actually come to that in the past, and during the civil rights movement Northern civilians were attacked by police and State militias representing a particular point of view. And this is a mechanism placed into our constitution by an unfortunate compromise made with the slave trade. Don’t believe it?

Add in the 3/5 compromise, essentially assigning yet more overrepresentation to southerners, and you might thInk the pro-electoral-college arguments are just a smokescreen that’s been going for 240 years. Now, inevitably, someone is going to bring up that the founders never intended a popular vote. Which is true, but irrelevant. They are long gone, and it’s a very different nation now. I’m pretty confident that they would be far more outraged by our political parties (which they were adamantly opposed to) and the quality of people in office, than by proposals to get rid of the “small state” advantages, which many of them saw as an odious compromise— or a good one, if they were from a small state. If the founding fathers were here today, they might propose something very much like superdelegates (but across party lines, since there would be no parties), chosen from state legislators, governors and prominent people — who would get together in a room and pick a President with no public involvement. Like I said, it’s a different country today. And sure, people are extra outraged when an election goes so strongly against the popular vote — for the second time, since Al Gore won the popular vote by half a million votes while losing the EC, and now, Hillary won by 3M and lost the EC. And sure, the folks who got the short end of the stick are the most exercised about it. Nothing wrong with that. Not trying to relitigate the election, but I do wish we could fix this for the future. Between this and the gerrymandered house— where Democrats are also consistently winning the popular vote while winding up with a minority of seats— and one person, one vote looks like a bad joke— it’s more like 1 Wyoming person, 4 votes. And as the nation further urbanizes and further concentrates into the big states, New Yorkers, Californians, and Texans will screwed over more and more each year until it gets fixed.

Apple has stated that the Mac's traditional input methods, such as the keyboard and trackpad, are more efficient and precise than touch screens for tasks such as typing, selecting text, and navigating menus. Another reason why Macs don't have touch screens is because the macOS operating system is not optimized for touch input. Unlike iOS, which is designed specifically for touch screens, macOS is designed for use with a keyboard and mouse or trackpad. Adding touch screen support to macOS would require significant changes to the operating system, which could potentially compromise its stability and performance. Finally, Apple may also be hesitant to add touch screens to Macs because it could cannibalize sales of its iPad and iPhone devices, which are designed specifically for touch input. By keeping touch screens exclusive to its mobile devices, Apple is able to maintain a clear distinction between its desktop and mobile product lines."},{"instruction":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","output":"I'd ask him if Peter Thiel keeps his A.I. “consciousness” on servers at Quora, or at his fortress in New Zealand, or does he use Facebook's?

The Sex Pistols were a train wreck. Sid Vicious was charged with murdering his girlfriend and then died of a drug overdose. The Eagles apparently were so dysfunctional while making “The Long Run” that they had to replace members who quit in the middle of the album.

Review: ‘Dil Bechara’ is the Hindi film adaptation of John Green’s popular 2012 novel, 'The Fault in Our Stars'. In fact, the book’s Hollywood adaptation with the same name in 2016 met with much critical acclaim. ‘Dil Bechara’ sets itself in Jamshedpur and introduces us to the Basu family. Kizie Basu (Sanjana Sanghi) suffers from thyroid cancer, which has now affected her lungs, requiring her to be on oxygen support almost all the time. With rock solid support from her parents, Kizie takes life as it comes, even taking the bleak, daily multiple hospital visits in her stride. But what she craves for, is a normal life like any girl her age – with regular problems like boyfriends, crushes et al. Instead what she ends up doing is attend funerals of people she doesn't know, to feel a connection of the inevitable that lies ahead of her. She meets Immanuel Rajkumar Junior or Manny (Sushant Singh Rajput) in college at first and later at a cancer support group. And given her quiet, introvert nature, at first, she is wary of his high energy, exuberance and cockiness. Manny has his own story – he has survived osteosarcoma and his cancer is currently in remission. The two strike up a beautiful bond as a smitten Manny manages to wriggle his way into her heart, despite Kizie trying hard to avert a heartbreak for him, eventually. Their cutesy chemistry grows on you as they zip through the lanes of Jamshedpur in his scooter. And also as they shoot a Bhojpuri film together for Manny's close friend, Jagdish Pandey (Sahil Vaid), whose dream is to direct a film before losing his eyesight to cancer. When Manny decides to go all out to fulfill Kizie’s long standing wish of meeting her favourite musician, Abhimanyu Vaid (Saif Ali Khan), she realises she has fallen for him, too. But little does she know that a tragic twist in the tale awaits her. Given its poignant premise, ‘Dil Bechara’ makes for a very emotional watch. Even as the story’s underlying message, of celebrating life despite knowing the inevitable, injects it with an infectious energy. Especially in the form of Manny’s character who wants to literally grab every moment of the day. Sushant Singh Rajput, navigating the depth of his character, shines with a stellar performance that is sensitive, intense, lively and vulnerable. It is with a heavy heart that one watches him effortlessly get under the skin of his character and exude a natural charm. With this, the fine actor adds to his legacy of commendable work in a short span of time. And watch out for his brilliant moves in the one-shot title track, choreographed by Farah Khan. Sanjana Sanghi who makes her debut in a leading role gives an assured, confident performance. The supporting cast, especially Swastika Mukherjee and Saswata Chatterjee as Kizie's parents are superb and Saif Ali Khan in a cameo is noteworthy. The soundtrack (composed by A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya) is peppered with some fantastic, foot-tapping music – particularly Khulke Jeene Ka, Taare Ginn and the title track, Dil Bechara. The chemistry between the lead pair is refreshing to watch, especially in the beautifully shot (cinematography by Satyajit Pande) sequences in Paris. Director Mukesh Chhabra and writers Suprotim Sengupta and Shashank Khaitan ensure the narrative flows, taking you through some tender, touching moments between Kizie and Manny and Kizie and her parents. And be prepared for some heartbreaking scenes and dialogues that will definitely bring you to tears. Even though the film’s spirit and breezy pace triumphs, the melancholy that augurs it, will leave you in a puddle of emotions and with a heavy lump in your throat as the end credits roll. ‘Dil Bechara’ will always be remembered as Sushant Singh Rajput’s swan song. Watch this movie simply to witness Sushant Singh Rajput’s last act. A brilliant one at that."},{"instruction":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","output":"There are many websites where you can find cheap flight tickets.

Somehow, they’ve done the impossible, making everyone hate it. I think this is one of the few times that fanatics in both Comicsgate and SJW’s despise something (though for very different reasons). For Comicsgaters and people that care about left-wing politics (in particular identity politics), this is the perfect example of what they believe is wrong with comic books these days. Left-wing politics that create shallow characters that are simply there to fulfil an agenda and tick the boxes in ‘how to be Woke’. POC (check), Non-binary (check), breaking stereotypes by having a plus-sized hero (check). Seriously, with characters like ‘Snowflake’ and ‘Safe-space’, Marvel is essentially making the argument for Comicsgate. For SJWs and those that believe diversity should be more prevalent in comic books, these characters come off more as mocking and joke characters. ‘Snowflake’, I believe, is supposed to be non-binary yet they make them look like a freak. I know it’s comics but it’s still pretty stupid to seemingly drive the narrative that all those that aren’t hetero-normative are somehow weird and look weird. People in those communities already have issues of their own and Marvel, in their quest to be ‘Woke’, did the exact opposite of ‘representation’ and made a joke of a character. Then There’s This Guy: Personally, I think it’s BRILLIANT how tone-deaf Marvel is. ‘Screentime’ apparently gets his powers from ‘experimental internet gas’. How quirky and ecCENtric. I can just imagine how funny the writers thought they were being and how ‘IN’ they would be with the ‘kids’. They must’ve thought, “People these days care about movements and diversity! It’ll totally be a hit with the younger generation!”, without understanding their readers, the current culture and the new generation at all. These writers probably never understood that we’re in the era of cringe. Regardless of leaning left or right, our new generation loves to stand by and cringe at how stupid people can be (especially past generations especially when they try to appeal to the kids by being ‘cool’). This time they’ve truly gifted everyone on the internet something to laugh at in these trying time. (Thank You, Marvel!) Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!

Here are a few commonly discussed drawbacks: High initial costs: Developing and implementing robots can involve significant upfront costs, including research and development, acquisition of hardware and software, and training. This cost factor may limit access to robotic technologies for smaller organizations or individuals.Limited flexibility and adaptability: While robots excel at performing specific programmed tasks, they may struggle with tasks that require complex decision-making, adaptability to dynamic environments, or fine motor skills. Robots are often less versatile compared to humans in handling unpredictable or novel situations.Job displacement and socioeconomic impact: The automation of certain tasks through robots can lead to job displacement for human workers. This can have socio-economic consequences, such as unemployment or the need for reskilling and job transition for affected individuals. Ensuring a smooth transition and addressing potential inequalities arising from automation is a significant challenge.Ethical considerations: As robots become more capable, ethical concerns arise regarding their decision-making, accountability, and potential impact on society. Questions about robot rights, safety, privacy, and the potential for bias or discrimination in AI systems require careful consideration and regulation.Maintenance and technical challenges: Robots require ongoing maintenance, regular software updates, and skilled technicians for repairs. Managing and troubleshooting complex robotic systems can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and resources.Dependence on technology: Relying heavily on robots can make systems vulnerable to technological failures, cyberattacks, or disruptions. A loss of connectivity, power outage, or system malfunction could temporarily halt operations and necessitate alternative plans or redundancies. It's important to note that these disadvantages are not inherent to all robots or robotic systems. Advancements in technology, continued research, and appropriate planning and regulations can help mitigate many of these challenges. Additionally, the benefits and advantages offered by robots, such as increased productivity, efficiency, and safety in certain applications, often outweigh these drawbacks, leading to their continued development and adoption in various industries."},{"instruction":"w did you end up in the San Francisco Bay Area?

I was casually aquatinted with another male teacher (different school) in the complex because our kids would be at the complex swimming pool together. I once had dinner at his home with a group of other people. We were both politically active in the gay community. He was tragically murdered by a young man he picked up (a trick, on other words).

The cops went to my boss and i was fired for “associating with known homosexuals.”. I sued. That pretty much killed my chance of ever working in the state again.

In folk Catholisism you turn to the archangel who is most fitted to be of help with your specific problem. Michael's name means \\"Who is like God\\" and Gabriel's name means \\"Power of God\\". There is also a third archangel, Rafael, whose name means \\"God has healed\\". This means that you turn to Michael with problems that are extreme or next to “impossible”, and especially for protection (he is the guy with the sword, remember). To Gabriel you turn when you need help with problems related to education, work, income, etc., (his lantern and scroll, for instance, are clues to his areas of specialisation). And you turn to Rafael with problems regarding health and the heart (he is often depicted holding a potion flask, and in the Bible you can find him as a healer). All three archangels are patrons of a lot of other things than these, of course, and have many other attributes and areas of specialisation than the ones I mention here."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"BLANK PAPER TICKET this is obviously one of the amazing features of indian railways. let's see about it thoroughly. When to avail the BLANK PAPER TICKET? Suppose you have to travel between Mathura and Ballia ( I am taking these two cities as example as i used to travel between these two when i was in my college , my home town is Ballia and my college was in Mathura). There wasn't any direct train between these two stations , if i had to travel to Ballia from mathura then i would come to Allahabad or Varanasi from one direct train and then to ballia in other train. in other train's case after deboarding the first train i would go to railway ticket counter , would take general ticket for ballia and would wait for next train to Ballia.(You can take reservation in other train between Varanasi and ballia but it's only 140kms and most trains don't allow reservation for such less distance ). This whole complexity used to make my journey very inconvenient and arduous. Let's come to the topic PAPER BLANK TICKET - It was the solution which made my whole journey very easy. This ticket allows you to cover your whole journey in a single ticket. For availing this type of ticket you have to do nothing but simply go the railway reservation counter and give your journey details in the reservation form, write above the reservation form \\"PAPER BLANK TICKET\\" and fill all your details. let's take this simple example again - Your journey is in between Mathura and Ballia.A Direct train is available between Mathura and Varanasi.An indirect train which comes from some other route ( suppose from Mumbai to Ballia) is available from Varanasi for Ballia. Now given the above scenerio , in BLANK PAPER TICKET your reservation will be booked between Mathura and Ballia , but a seat will be alloted between Mathura and Varanasi only because a direct train is available in this route and that's why a seat will be alloted in this route only. From Varanasi you can travel in any train's reserved coach but a seat will not be alloted to you in that particular train , you will have the right to enter the reserved coach of that particular train and reach your destination but no any specific seat will be alloted to you. you can sit at any seat by requesting any fellow passenger. You can see in the attached image how to fill the reservation form or you can ask at the counter about filling of form. The only con of this system is that you will have to book your ticket on railway counters only. it can't be booked online."},{"instruction":"w much would it cost to crowdfund a mission using SpaceX to catch up and explore Oumuamua?","output":"It’s not possible, cost is not the issue."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

You could be a sober, in-control person who is choosing to go too fast (which is illegal, by the way), or you could be an intoxicated, out-of-control person who is going to kill themselves or somebody else if they are allowed to proceed. If you had not responded to his warning, he would have concluded you were a menace to society and made an effort to take you off the road. You noticed him and his warning, so stopping you wasn’t as high a priority. If he had been going the same direction as you and had nothing more important going on, he would have pulled you over. He was going the other way, and may have been responding to something more important than a speeder, so he just gave you a reminder. You got lucky."},{"instruction":"Why is programming so high in demand but so hard to get a programming job?","output":"Although there is a high requirement for experienced programmers in the field, lucrative programming jobs are hard to land. This is generally why so many programmers are left unemployed. The main problem is that many programmers lack the soft skills and technical skills required to be an effective employee. India is a hub for IT and software companies so there are a lot of opportunities available in India for programmers. Personally, I would recommend expanding your knowledge domain in regards to various programming languages. You can learn new languages on various platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Simplilearn, and others. Aside from this, programmers should focus on developing various soft skills such as: Leadership and delegationSociability and OpennessOrganizational SkillsTeamwork and CollaborationTime Management SkillsEmpathyActive ListeningProactivityPlanning and Coordination SkillsTaking Personal Accountability"},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

Some Sony Xperia models can even play high-resolution audio files (up to 24bit/192Khz). But simply connecting headphones (regardless of whatever their “hi-fi”- credentials) directly to your phone won’t reveal all the nuances of even ‘standard’ 16/44.1 FLAC audio files. The limiting factor is the phone’s built-in DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and amplifier. Since physical space and battery life are at such a premium when designing a phone, manufacturers are forced to compromise in their choice of DAC and amp silicon. Most of the time this isn’t an issue - most end-users will be happy with the sound coming out of their phone/standard earbuds when playing compressed MP3s or streaming audio. Move on up to lossless or HD audio, and most devices will be found wanting. To get the best possible quality out of 16bit/44.1Khz (or higher) FLAC files on a phone you need to be able to output the untouched digital signal, then send it to a DAC and amp. Most Android phones sold today support direct digital audio output (i.e. bypassing the internal DAC and amp) usually by using what’s called a USB OTG cable. Note that any old mobile phone USB cable doesn’t necessarily support USB OTG - you’ll need to check. Then it’s a question of adding a mobile DAC/amp, and connecting that to your headphones/earbuds. Some names to look out for in the mobile DAC/amp world are FiiO, iFi, Chord, AudioLab, Audioquest, or RHA. Of course it goes without saying that you need to be using high-quality headphones or earbuds, that connect via a cable. Using any wireless Bluetooth device won’t give you as good a result, even from devices that use the latest [LINKED_TEXT: aptX-HD] [URL: https://www.soundguys.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-bluetooth-aptx-and-aptx-hd-19914/] or [LINKED_TEXT: LDAC] [URL: https://www.soundguys.com/ldac-ultimate-bluetooth-guide-20026/] codecs.

As a woman boarded the Mumbai-Bengaluru Udyan Express at Gulbarga, Karnataka, she noticed that the compartment was jam packed and with great difficulty she managed to find a seat. The ticket inspector or TC came and started checking people’s tickets. He turned towards her and asked her about the ticket. She replied “I have already shown you my ticket.” The TC said “Not you madam, the girl hiding below your berth.” It was when the woman observed that a young girl about 13–14 years old was hiding below her berth. When the TC yelled at her, the girl came out of hiding and she looked very scared and it appeared as though she had been crying previously. The TC tried to forcibly pull her away from the compartment when the woman intervened. She said “I will pay for her ticket”. The TC was surprised and the woman paid for that girl’s ticket and the TC left the compartment. Then the woman and the girl started talking. It was when the woman realised that the girl’s name was Chitra who lived in a village near Bidar district of Karnataka. Her father was a coolie and she had lost her mother long back. Her father had remarried and her stepmother ill-treated her. Now even her father had died and out of fear, Chitra had escaped. By the time the train reached Bengaluru, the woman got down from the train and saw Chitra’s sad face. The woman again took pity on Chitra and took her to her friend’s place. Her friend managed shelter homes for boys and girls, which were supported by the woman’s organisation. Chitra now had a new direction in her life. The woman frequently talked with Chitra and enquired about her well being. Chitra was a bright student and this woman wanted to sponsor her college studies. But Chitra politely said that she wanted to do a diploma in Computer Science so that she could immediately get a job. She completed her diploma successfully and obtained a job in a software company. With her first salary, she bought a new saree and a box of sweets to the woman who had guided her. Chitra then got the opportunity to fly to the US from her company. She called this woman, took her blessings and flew to the US. The two always kept in touch via email. After a few years, the woman went to San Francisco to attend a Kannada Koota meet which was organised by Kannadiga families living in California. She was staying in the same hotel where the meet was taking place. After the meet, when the woman was about to checkout from the hotel, the hotel staff told her that her bill had already been paid and pointed out to the person who had paid the bill. The woman then saw a lady with a young man who was her husband. This lady was none other than Chitra and both the ladies were filled with joy on seeing each other after a long time. Chitra touched the woman’s feet and took her blessings. The woman now asked Chitra “Why did you pay for my hotel bill Chitra?”. Chitra was overwhelmed with tears, hugged the woman and told her “Because you paid for my ticket from Mumbai to Bengaluru!” This woman has helped a number of Chitras come up in life. Many such Chitras have found a new direction in life courtesy this woman who is an inspiration to every Indian. This woman is a philanthropist and her social work covers healthcare, education, empowerment of women, public hygiene, art and culture, and poverty alleviation at the grassroots level. Her vision of a library for each school has resulted in the setting up of 50,000 libraries so far across India. She is helping out rural areas by building 10,000 public toilets and improving the sanitation. Through the chairperson of the organisation, she has helped in the rehabilitation of areas affected by natural calamities and she is a prolific writer in Kannada and English. Her husband is also very famous but it is the lady who undoubtedly is big hearted. She is very simple and down to earth despite her unmatched fame. This woman who has helped thousands of Chitras get a new life is none other than Mrs. Sudha Murthy, the Chairperson of the Infosys Foundation."},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"I’d like to know what the world would be like today if there had been no Hitler. No World War II. No fear of a Nazi revolution any time anybody says something rude about another group of people. No national fortunes plunged into buying a war machine. Just before World War I most of Europe and most of the world was enjoying a particular time of relaxation which brought about an explosion in the arts. By the end of the twentieth century fighting two world wars almost wiped out the economies of many formerly prosperous nations. Our economic and social landscape would look very different today. Ironically though, the alternative may be worse. The devastation of World War II may be what been holding us back from a far more serious world war with more recent modern weapons. Then again, if there had been no WWII, then the Americans might not have felt such an urge to develop nuclear weapons. The idea of a world with no Hitler raises many interesting questions."},{"instruction":"w do you deliver effective communication?","output":"In a quiet place, with a gentle tone, and with compassion.

Each department has its own pros and cons. Lets compare Indian Railway and Central Water Commission. PAY Scale - In both the department officers are recruited at basic pay of 56100 and Pay scale of 56100-177500 (Level 10, Group A officers)Place of Posting - If you want to live in a metro city then Central water commission is a right choice. In indian railway there are very few chances that you will live in a metro city and if you get chance then it will be for a very shorter period of time.Work Life Balance - Central water commission is far ahead than indian railway in work life balance.Powers - Central water commission lags behind than indian railway because Water is a State Subject.Transfers - there are frequent transfers in indian railway but same is not the case with central water commissionGrowth - If you are talking in terms of promotion then their is not much difference in Indian Railway and Central water commission. Promotion depends upon multiple things like how many officers are ahead of you in your batch itself and how many officers have been recruited in recent years etc. One more thing, even if you are not promoted, your salary will increase (as per Pay Parity Rule)Perks - Indian railway officers enjoys many perks that central water commission officers does not get. Like - Train pass for you and your dependent family members. But there is one shortcoming of this - Indian railway officers have to travel with Train irrespective of distance while central water commission officers are eligible to travel by flight on official tours. I think it is the time that matters when you are in service.Work - You will hear that there is no work in central water commission. It is completely wrong. I am working in central water commission and believe me there is sufficient work (more than enough). No need to tell about work in Indian Railway :) So you can see both department has their pros and cons. If you want to enjoy a good life with proper work life balance then go with central water commission and if you want to enjoy power and perks then go with indian Railway.

A debate is centered around a topic (in jazz the topic would be the “head” or chords and melody of the piece) People debating will “riff” around the topic agreeing or disagreeing with each other and sometimes elaborating on a point of view. In the same way jazz musicians will keep in mind the song that they are improvising over. Improvisers each get to have their “say” and often build on the previous solo or play something in response to it. But they have to remain aware of the “topic”: the chords, melody, tempo, time signature, where the “one” is, the form etc. (Note I'm obviously generalising here. This doesn't all apply to free jazz) I'll add a couple of other things here: the history of the music is important as it gives you an idea of where the music came from and what aspects it took from other styles. Music theory helps us analyse music. An improviser needs to be able to analyse chord progressions so that they can decide what notes to use. They do this analysis on the fly - it becomes second nature. Music theory can also teach how to create musical tension (and release) for composers and improvisers. It teaches how to build melodic lines and which notes clash or sound consonant in particular contexts. I don't know if I've answered your question properly. Music theory can't “explain” jazz. Jazz is a very wide genre these days and different styles of jazz have some things in common and are a part on other ways. Music theory can describe chord progressions in Roman Numerals (identify the quality and function of chords), how melody notes relate to the chords etc. But theory can do this for any musical style. It doesn't “explain” the style."},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"if thats what he wants to do let him do it."},{"instruction":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","output":"There are plenty of resources beyond just a google search.

The things i want from my life that requires me to wake up early. These things are- Healthy life:- I always want to live a healthy life. I want my mind and body always support me.For this first condition is to get up early everyday. To make body fit you need to do some kind of exercises on regular bases. And yoga makes your mind active. If you want the best outcome from exercise and yoga, practice them early in the morning. So, I can't afford delay. Believe in God:- I believe in God. And i like worshipping God on the daily bases. Morning is the best time for worshipping. It motivates me to get up early. Activeness:- I want activeness in myself. What you do in early morning proves for you. If you gets up by leaving the idleness behind,the existence of idleness remains no more for you. You become active. if you remain sleep, you feel sleepy all the day. So to be active is my another motivation. Making the mind sharp:- The habit of waking up early makes mind sharp. The atmosphere of morning session is always good for mind. This time helps mind to get sharpen. This thing motivates me to get up early. Doing more and more work:- I want to work a lot in my professional life. I find morning time most suitable for work. So, this thing motivates me to wake up early.

It's not a quick-fix or a get-rich-quick scheme that lazy individuals can bank on. Now, onto the best way to start making money with affiliate marketing. The first step is to identify a niche that you are truly passionate about. Do not choose a niche solely based on its perceived profitability. You need to have genuine enthusiasm and knowledge in order to create valuable content that resonates with your audience. This will set you apart from the countless other affiliates who are merely chasing trends and copying each other. Next, focus on building an authoritative online presence. Establish a high-quality website or blog that provides insightful information, product reviews, and engages with your target audience. Invest time and effort into creating valuable content that educates, entertains, and solves problems for your audience. This will not only attract organic traffic but also position you as a trusted authority in your niche. Once you have built a solid foundation, it's time to select the right affiliate products to promote. Research and choose products that align with your niche and audience's needs. Avoid promoting anything that you wouldn't personally use or endorse. People can sense authenticity, and if you're just pitching random products for a quick buck, you'll quickly lose credibility. Additionally, leverage social media platforms and email marketing to expand your reach and engage with your audience. Build an email list, create compelling content, and establish a strong social media presence. Engage, interact, and build relationships with your audience, as this will significantly increase your chances of converting leads into sales. As you progress in your affiliate marketing journey, always monitor your results, test different strategies, and adapt accordingly. Be persistent, stay consistent, and never shy away from investing in yourself and your knowledge. Remember, success in affiliate marketing comes from hard work, perseverance, and a genuine desire to provide value to your audience.

I have one spoiled VC relationship -- all the rest I consider pretty strong. Here's what happened to me: I told this Top Tier VC what the valuation was, my Ask. I was 100% clear on this in every way, shape and form.The First VC nevertheless wrote me a term sheet at a lower valuation.The First VC also wrote in this term sheet granting his firm 3/5 of the Board seats at Series A.I didn't respond in any way, at all. The First VC then left to go vacation on Some Expensive Island.The Second VC then gave me the term sheet I asked for, the asked-for valuation, and 1 Board seat.Before accepting from the Second VC, I called the First VC, who was still vacationing on Some Expensive Island. I told him.The First VC became outraged, and said at his Top Tier VC Firm, no one had ever not closed a signed term sheet. Ever.I told him I'd never signed it (I hadn't), we'd never even discussed it -- and that it wasn't what I'd asked for, and that we'd never agreed.The First VC got so mad, he went to the Second VC, and insisted they not fund me.Which created huge drama. Ok so what happened? Did I do anything wrong? Was I less than transparent, ever? No. Of course not. Not only did I sign absolutely nothing, but my ask wasn't met. And I was completely, 100% transparent in the process. To my detriment, in fact, such that the First VC went and tried to force the Second VC not to do the deal. But what did happen is the First VC was convinced in his mind he had a done deal. Even though we clearly did not. The learning: just make sure VCs know exactly where they stand. Be 100% crystal clear, in writing, in email. >> Don't let VCs think they have a deal if they don't. Even completely inadvertently. That spoils the relationship."},{"instruction":"EU chiefs have failed to clinch a deal for a new 96% effective Novavax Covid19 vaccine. The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels.

They could just change the law, give themselves emergency powers and all Novavax would be left holding is a piece of paper.

But thinking about what I’d tell my fourteen year old self if I could, I’d tell her to take it easy. For me, high school was the toughest. Way tougher than college. I say that because I’m sure my stress levels were through the roof compared to now, and the number of hours of sleep I got was much lower than my current number (which is way in excess of how much sleep is recommended a night). There was a lot of pressure and self hate on myself when I was in high school, and I had such a negative mindset. I wish I could look my fourteen year old self in the eyes and say “it WILL get better.” That phrase is a cliché, so I had heard it many times, but of course seeing my future self say that would’ve been proof that the phrase is true. There are still things about being fourteen, however, that I appreciate now looking back. I was still very much a kid, I didn’t have to act like an adult. I wasn’t expected to be one. I was also privileged that I didn’t have to grow up so fast. Sure, it might be frustrating feeling like no one trusts you because they just see you as an immature kid, but that’s exactly what I was. Past high school, at least for me, I’m expected to be a competent adult. Well, my protective parents are just as protective over me as they were six years ago, but otherwise, in a lot of the spaces I find myself in, I’m no child. I have to have my sh** together. I’m a certified EMT, and I’m in the final stages of my paramedic program, so I better know - at the very least - how to properly do CPR because someone’s LIFE is on the line. Okay sure, a lot of people as young as fourteen know and get certified to provide basic life support, but it’s still a big deal. And it definitely has to be a no brainer for anyone working in EMS, or any medical setting. Point is, despite how hard it can be to be a kid, it still has its pros that end up disappearing growing up. Sorry, veered off the subject a bit. Yes, I’d want to tell my fourteen year old self to take it easy, but I’d still want to emphasize to myself “but not TOO easy.” To me, I’m still exactly what I was upset about all the adults seeing me as - an immature kid. I now fully agree with them. No one ever stops maturing for as long as they live anyway. There’s always a lesson to be learned; always wisdom to be earned. So. Since I’m still young and naïve yet know more than I did when I was fourteen, I’ve realized that preparing early won’t hurt. I’ve realized that it’s especially important to hyper-absorb as much as possible from the standard school subjects, but more importantly the nitty gritty lessons from just getting through the day to day and learning from those older than us, when we’re in our teenage years. Even when we think the world is against us (which is honestly kinda true), even when we think life is so unfair and nobody understands us, we have to give a damn. We have to try to start putting the pieces together. We have to own up to the responsibility of learning and improving (it never ends). We have to take our lives SERIOUSLY. Because after that, even though we all know we’re still immature as hell into our twenties, a lot of important people will expect us to be proper adults and have our sh** together - even though those same people know we really don’t. We OURSELVES will expect those same things within us. Just look at how much pressure is on young people these days, both from within and outside of ourselves. But these high expectations exist because other people know, and we as young people sort of know, that we HAVE to learn to survive independently in this world. Everyone knows it’ll push us to figure things out, to have goals, to do our jobs right to contribute to a positive difference, to have lifestyles where we can sigh with relief when we look in the mirror, knowing that we’re doing the best we can. It’s cheesy! I know. But how GRATIFYING is that - self-assurance?! A pat on the back! Progress! It’s a damn PLEASURE. To put it more simply to any fourteen year old out there, work hard and take your goals and responsibilities seriously; it will help you in the long run because criticism and mistakes are inevitable. But you have more room to mess up at this stage in life. Also, don’t let the days just pass you by, because if you’re privileged enough not to be expected to act like an adult, like I was, do as kids your age do (as long as it’s safe and responsible haha) because you won’t have the same kind of fun at twenty four versus fourteen. Just a couple other things that came to mind just now: I wish I could tell my fourteen year old self to start learning what my boundaries are, what I stand for and what I do not stand for, and most importantly, not to let even the slightest move pass from someone else to take advantage of me. I wish I started to boost my self-respect, strengthen it so I wouldn’t let anyone walk over me - to let someone charge right through my boundaries to hurt me. I do know though that it’s always bound to happen, but it would certainly help to have a tougher front. As we get older, since I’ve said repeatedly we will be expected to be adults, we are more susceptible to being hurt. I believe there’s more protection when you’re a kid. So please learn to stand up for yourself. Remember, you are as valuable now as you were when you were born, as you will be when you’re twenty, then twenty-four, into your sixties, even when you’re so old you can hardly move or talk or hold your pee in (I’m sorry I’m gross but that’s a common reality actually!). So always treat yourself right, and get as much as you can out of the world for your benefit (and the benefit of anyone else you love).

You should eat simple carbohydrates that will provide you with sufficient blood sugar to perform. Your muscles need sugar to contract. When blood sugar is low, your performance is compromised. Yes, pop tarts and kool-aid will work, but bananas and Gatorade are more preferable choices. You don’t need much. Just enough to raise your blood sugar level. After the workout is where protein is needed. Within 20 minutes after the workout, you’ll need a post exercise meal of carbohydrates and protein. The carbohydrates replace muscle glycogen and the protein not only helps get sugar (glucose) into muscles (as glycogen,) but it also assists with muscle recovery. Examples include chocolate milk, Carnation Instant Breakfast shake, etc. Liquid sources, such as these, are better as they absorb faster. You have to eat within 20 minutes as the receptors on your muscles will “retract” after awhile and you won’t be able to replace all the nutrients into the muscle as efficiently if you wait too long."},{"instruction":"What is the best theory on how most of preIndoEuropean languages disappeared but some survived despite the population changing in the same way?","output":"Because it precedes writing there is no good model that could predict events; it only takes 2 or 3 generations of rulers marrying into locals to adopt a local tongue or not.

The Stones were a carefully managed product. With some exceptions, they rarely got out of their box of blues (Sympathy for the Devil, Gimme Shelter, 2,000 Light Years from Home). The Who were explosive, unpredictable, hugely more energetic and lyrical. They had no box to be in. They invented stuff (feedback, drums and bass as \\"lead\\" instruments, unusual arrangements, unusual topics for lyrics), a stage presence that had never been seen. They just broke so many molds in such an exciting way. The Stones stood there and said, “Aren’t we cool?” We smirk, play blues riffs, and sing about sex. And we’re absolutely glued to plodding along with whatever Charlie and Keith can manage to do. The Who pulled down the house — not just with antics, but with pure joy in playing and inventing and breaking rules, not like “punk,” but with Townsend’s barely contained management and structure and much more adroit songwriting. The Stones were always in control, supplying a version of a well-known product. The Who were like a nuclear reaction in a containment facility always about to break down. Much more exciting and interesting. My opinion. I found the controlled chaos and lyrical structures of The Who much better (more interesting, more fun, better entertainment, more poignant) than the boxed-in, rarely surprising, too-careful, dig-me Stones."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

Kalyanasundaram was born and brought up in Melakaruvelangulam village, of Nangunari taluk in Tirunelveli district of Tamil nadu. When he was doing his library science in Madras university in 1963. During Indo China war Nehru was requesting for donation in FM, Kalyansundaram felt the need of Indian army went to Kamaraj ( then cm of Tamil nadu) and donated his gold chain. It was from this point in his life that he started his selfless service to nation by donating all he can to the education of poor. He later joined Kumarkarupa Arts College in Tuticorin as librarian and spent 35 years there, and the best part is he donated every penny of his 35 years salary to the district collector for betterment of poor ( every penny) and also he donated all his part of ancestral properties. For 45 years, Kalyanasundaram's social work focussed on children. However, in 1998, after retirement, he decided to expand his service and, thus, Paalam was born. One of the first things he did was to direct the money he received as retirement benefit to social cause. Paalam serves as the link between donors and beneficiaries. Assistance is not only monetary. Children are helped in pursuing education, medical attention is provided to the needy, blood donation camps are organised and blood samples are reached to hospitals during emergencies, the unemployed, elderly, sick and handicapped are rehabilitated, and free counselling is provided. For all these services an American organisation recognised him as ‘ man of millennium ‘. He received 30 crore INR as award money and the best part is he donated all the 30 crore to society. Such a selflessman. And on the otherside we do have a citizen like this. A man who is curse to the Indian politics.

It is commonly built in two configurations - Foam based and Spring based. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. As a thumb rule, springs having diameter in the range of 1.3-1.7 mm (14 to 16-gauge) make up for a high quality mattress which provides the best balance between firmness and cushioning and provides the best support to the body.Whereas, the springs having diameters above 1.7 mm (12 gauge) make the mattress too firm and it no longer remains supportive or comfortable. Whereas, Foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or other who prefer body hugging comfort. On the other hand, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should decide on according to the dimensions of the bed and awareness about the ways by which some brands cut manufacturing costs and produce low-grade mattresses which cause several neck and spine issues too play influential roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 18th August, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration. Here is the one that I purchased 👇"},{"instruction":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","output":"My worst fear in a hostel would be ADDICTION. Hostellites get addicted to sleeping all the time, alcohol, weed, procrastination, bunking lectures, yada yada yada."},{"instruction":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","output":"The first thing you must understand is that social security and Medicare have nothing to do with the deficit. Republicans are very good at trying to pretend that a is connected to b when there's nothing at all between the two items. Social security and Medicare come out of your payroll check. There is no money borrowed to fund either one of them. They are self-funding. So when someone tells you it affects the deficit go tell them to screw themselves. Now that we've got that explained. Secondly those politicians that you mentioned don't give a damn about the deficit. Why? Mitch McConnell said it himself and I heard him say this. Oh the deficit is not important when we are in control. The reason they want the money from social security and Medicare. Is because they don't give a damn about the common man who worked all his life to pay into those systems. And it drives them absolutely crazy not to be able to put their hands on monies floating in the government that they cannot control. If you're talking about deficit spending, then you are talking about a totally separate item, the general tax fund. They're in many cases when we take taxes in, not related to social security and medicare, through normal payroll deductions, we get sometimes less taxes in and more consumption or discretionary spending of that money going out. There are many ways to reduce the situation, without taking money from Seniors citizens and a totally different pot. For example the inflation reduction act now allows us to negotiate pharmaceutical prices. . Do you know the Republicans didn't want that to happen, because they would rather give their pharmaceutical friends more of our tax dollars. That way the pharmacies will then turn the money around and give it back to the Republicans as donation kickbacks."},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

No one in the UK wants them back…And frankly as an American I don't want them either. Race never had anything to do with their attitudes. Just a card to play"},{"instruction":"it worth buying a laptop for Ubuntu or Linux in general? What are some good brands to buy from, and what should be considered when buying one (battery life, weight, etc.)?","output":"For Ubuntu, Lenovo, Dell and HP are the best. They participate in the Ubuntu Certified program, where Canonical has people testing the hardware to make sure everything is working perfectly. This testing takes time, so currently, there are most laptops certified for Ubuntu 20.04LTS. The website is not good for shopping, because it doesn’t allow you to browse by feature or price range. But it is good to check against before you buy. Of course, even if a laptop isn’t on the list, it doesn’t mean it won’t work with Ubuntu. Most laptops will work just fine out of the box, but if you’re buying one specifically for Ubuntu, I would stick to the certified ones if possible.

This answer is about the day, 1 Nov 2022. Waking up and getting ready I slept at 11:30 the previous night. My roommate woke me at 6:00 am, but then we both decided to sleep for 15 mins more, then he woke me at 6:15 am and then went to brush his teeth. I slept again due to my sleep crisis for the past few days, when he came, he again woke me at 6:30 am to which I finally woke and went to brush my teeth. After getting ready by getting chance to use the washrooms (the quality of which can’t be expressed in mere words) after hell lot of waiting, I got ready at around 7:20 am. Then at 7:30, I went to have bfast with my friends and left for the labs at 7:50 am. Lab I reached the stationary shop to find that my pre-ordered lab coat was not arrived yet. So I decided to take the manual and go for the labs. After a while, I finally figured out where it was and then I was alloted a partner and experiment to do. The instructors told about how to do the experiment, which I understood after a lot of difficulty since there was 1 person for about 10 people, so it was difficult to see, even hear since they spoke softly. After getting to know about the first few steps, I along with my partner started to execute it, little we knew that it would take hell lot of time as there were so many groups of 2 for the same practical and apparatus were limited. After hustling through the process of listening, understanding and then executing around 3 times, finally I got the final result of the experiment, got the sign of the instructor and left the lab at 12:10. I was in great hurry to finish off the things, since it could not be carried in the next lab and our lab started at 10:00 am rather than 9:00, thanks to the formalities, intro and partner distribution. I was exhausted a bit, went to take my bag out of the shelf and to add to my exhaustion, on removal of the bag, my plastic bottle fell and broke, leaking all the water from the bottle. I was thirsty at first, and also exhausted and when the bottle broke, I was even more angry, rather helpless I should say. Then I went to the stationary shop to get the lab coat and the engineering drawing kit. Now, there was a bunch of people around the shop as everyone wanted to buy these. You see I was already exhausted and I had to hustle through the crowd to get the 2 things. After 10 mins I got the 2 things and decided to go to my hostel. Little did I know that I forgot to take a left turn. I was on my cycle with an inclined seat which was to be fixed, I was holding the kit on one hand and using cycle with the other and it was a few mins later that I found, I reached the KV. Can you imagine in the scorching sun with hell lot of issues getting to know that you are lost? I asked the security guard to guide to my hostel and then finally I reached my hostel with extreme tiredness and thirst. Lunch It was around 12:45. I came to my room, changed clothes, sat for a minute or 2 and then went to the mess taking a new bottle to fill from my room. Had lunch, filled my bottle and went to see my cycle. You see, the lock of my cycle was hell bad and took a long time to open. I was thinking to change the lock but wasn’t getting the time to do it. I managed to open it somehow and then went to go to the class at 1:50 pm. Classes I reached the lecture hall at 2:05 with cycling at the maximum possible speed I could. You see, after cycling so much that too at a high speed in uphill roads, I was even more tired. When I reached the lecture hall, there was not even a single seat in the front or middle rows. I sat at the second last row alone. You might be thinking that why I am not with friends. Well, I am a slow eater, I take a lot of time at the mess so since I have a group they go altogether and I just sit alone to finish my lunch. Now we had an intro class of engg drawing. I was so tired that I dozed off for a few mins until the person sitting next to me woke me to fill the attendence sheet. Then I attended the class. It was supposed to end at 2:55, but it ended at 3:00. I called my friends to see if there was a seat empty near them so that I could shift there to which they replied in the positive. I was just going to shift but then the prof of EE arrived. So I remained seated at my place. The class was light as it was dealing with basics of NOR NAND gates, so not some heavy acads. Then it ended on time, and I shifted to a seat near my friends. Now, we had a chemistry class. Since organic was my fav, I was hoping to get an organic class which could lighten up my mood, but we had a physical class. The class’ content was boring, very boring rather, quantum mechanics, involving eqns that are so long and I heard them for the first time. The prof was good and kind enough to leave us at 4:50. My legs were paining like hell due to lot of cycling. I was tired. So, I convinced my friends to stop at a tea shop and have tea. After having tea, I reached the hostel with my friends. Hostel I reached the hostel, went to the stationary to get a new lock for my cycle. My friends were busy in downloading the provisional ID card which just came out, so they sat in the lobby of the hostel. I was so tired that even if I wanted to go to the lobby, I couldn’t. So, I came to my room, relaxed for an hour and then went to the lobby to see that they had already downloaded the ID. I had FOMO. Then I came to room and downloaded it alone. It was around 8 pm when I finished downloading it. You see, I did not do a single productive thing after classes. My friends went to do dinner, again I could not go with them as I had to bookmark the lecture slides link in my laptop. I took a long time to do it since I did not use laptops till now. I used tab for my online classes. I had a banana shake alone and then I went to do dinner, had it and I was so tired that I slept when my friends were playing TT. Outro I am a very slow eater and do things slowly. I mess up a lot and always do things with some kinds of discomfort. I am not able to cope up with so much hectic schedule and what makes me sad is that my friends keep enjoying and cope up easily. I did not even go to a DJ night on 31st when all my friends were there. Today on 2nd Nov, I am sitting alone in my room writing this answer and I don’t know where my friends are and what they are doing. As of now acads are easy as they have just begun. I fear how I would cope up in following years when acads get intense aka non-JEE and how will I manage CP with acads. My parents keep asking me about process of branch change and here I am struggling with inorganic, maths, digital electronics and engg drawing. IITs are fun until you enter one. The big campus excites you until you realise how tiring it is to commute. The beauty excites you unless you realise there are so many mosquitos,earthworm,lizards and spiders in the washrooms. There are lot of clubs, sport courts, food shops, events, fests but one needs time and energy to get involved in these which is apparently missing for me. God knows what is planned for me. Hope following week goes well. Signing off."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"I will be talking of very basic stuffs. Every Integrated Circuit has a number that has specific meaning. Like one below: 2. Notice the chip above, it has an arrow mark, it signifies the 1st pin of IC, and then the second pin will be the one below it. This numbering will go anticlockwise. 3. Sometimes when your house is running on inverter in your house, and suddenly the light comes, you can hear a click sound. That is a Relay which acts like a switch 4. In rural areas, electricians use fuse in neutral wire and not in live wire. So be careful even if you have put down the mains. 5. The 4 wires that are in the electrical pole have 3 phases carrying same voltage. Many people think that the one of the wires carry more voltage as people use it for AC, Heavy machines. It is not the case, it is just like one wire has been kept separate to keep load balance on all the three wires. 6. You can create a mobile charger just in 50 rupees with replaceable 12 V cell. 7. Its not like that if your fan at speed level 1 will take less power than at speed level 5. Its the high resistance at speed 5 (as compared to at speed 1 ) which will eat the power. 8. This two will work the same. You can try with your mobile charger. In addition it will give you more grip.

Is it really profitable?","output":"Hi! What is Dropshipping? If you’ve spent some time on the internet, then you’ve probably heard of dropshipping. The term combines an action that suggests giving up responsibility, with another sexless term that describes the least desirable part of shopping online. Using your powers of induction, you can probably figure out what it means. Dropshipping is a business model where the business in question sells another business’s products and, when an order is placed, “drops” the latter’s product onto the end consumer by way of shipping, without ever having any inventory. Is Dropshipping really profitable? Dropshipping can be a good source of income if you do your homework, meaning sufficient market research to identify the right product, the right supplier, and the right shipping services to deliver your goods. You should be aware that dropshipping isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme, at least not anymore. Dropshipping has become highly competitive, often with razor-thin margins and challenging supply chain management issues that’ll make you wish you were still working a 9-to-5. It is still possible to be successful at dropshipping, however, as long as you’re willing to dig in for the long haul. In time, once you’ve gathered enough experience dealing with suppliers and other logistical issues, you may find it more profitable, and fulfilling, to start your own DTC brand and sell your own products!"},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Do you think there should be an all female Avengers movie and would you go watch it?","output":"In the beginning, I think most of the team would be sullen and introvert. But after a few adventures, thew would grow more accustomed to each other. There team would also be very intense and maybe even violent. I mean, wouldn’t be so awesome to see Wasp and Gamora fighting a squad back to back. Imagine how cool the fight choreography would look. Of course at some points some people would be upset at themselves because of their past such as Gamora and Black Widow, but that’s what the team is for,support. Also, it would be even more cool to see two skilled assassins arguing against each other on the best way to infiltrate a base. I think the all-female avengers would mostly take place in space though. I don’t know why but I feel like that would just make things looks so much cooler."},{"instruction":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","output":"Thanks Om for A2A :-) I am scared of insects, dogs and monkeys.

My bags were checked at Odessa airport and Boryspil in 2012 and 2013, and maybe 2014 - not sure about 2014? Everyone’s bag was checked against a baggage receipt in Russia, when I visited there in 2013.

How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","output":"Top Mutual Funds need not be best performers. When inward fund flow is huge, during high bull market, they may not be wise to allocate the funds. During a downturn, they will be the most affected. Thus it is wise to choose a good Mutual fund, read features of each category, choose the one, which matches to your investment profile. Choosing multiple MFs is not advisable.

As you grow, the law of diminishing returns will inhibit the actual growth of tissue due to many physiological and biomechanical reasons. muscle over-growth can be unfunctional over time and reduce life expectancy due to not being able to function properly in nature as a hunter-gatherer, and due to stress placed on other organs. thats why hypertrophy inhibitions serve us, are important, and are overridden by unnatural chemical compounds used is sports (and have detrimental effects to health if abused and used for long periods of time), or genetic defects ([LINKED_TEXT: for example] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myostatin-related_muscle_hypertrophy]). as a former soldier, and current competing natural and tested doby builder and powerlifter, who trains competitors as well, i can tell you that when training for combat and war, you do many functions other than the muscle-growing specific work mentioned above. dont get me wrong, if you are un-trained and go into the military as a combat soldier, you will put significant amounts of muscle on, but far from maximal amounts and if you grew a lot of muscle prior to drafting in a muscle growing specific training, you might even lose macle. bodybuilders train in a very muscle-growth-specific training that is meant to override the muscle growth inhibitors and maximize muscle growth triggers. all those means will probably not have a sufficient amount of cardiovascular stamina, muscle stamina, or other metabolic functions that the body will have to perform in order to cary out other functions necessary to survive and “get the job done”. BTW, Hollywood acters are renowned for using hormone therapy in order to maintain and fit different roles. id bet my hard earned monet that at least the rock is using hormones to maintain a super human physique. vin diesel is a little more questionable…"},{"instruction":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","output":"I have a story from my own life that I believe best describes the how of leadership.

Can someone explain it in simple words?","output":"Networks uses different technologies based on distance, speed, maintainability. MAC addresses are used on Ethernet network. Everybofy knows MAC adresses because its the most common used by computers. But its limited to 100 meters. Your Internet provider needs to cover many kilometers. Ethernet can’t be used outside to connect homes to central office. They can use copper twisted pairs DSL, coax Docsys, Optical fiber, wimax, Cellular radio, etc… these uses different format of interface addresses. Ethernet MAC changes from network segment to the next. The IP addresse remain the same accros the Internet as packets travel from Technology to rhe next. In your house, besides Ethernet, you are probably using Wifi. Wifi router uses 6 bytes MAC on their wired Interface. But the radio MAC address measures 18 bytes. So MAC adresses are not compatible between technologies. You might be using zigbee also. Zigbee is the wireless network for IoT. Slower than wifi, more reliable, longer range. Zigbee uses 1 bytes device adresse, 2 bytes group adresses. Zigbee adressing scheme works differently than Ethernet and bluetooth.

Does anyone have any comments?","output":"The other answer, which I just read, is right on the mark. I just want to supplement it with a brief reminder that there is a upper size limit on any uranium fission device, whether implosion or gun type (ignoring for the moment that the question implied some type of non-existant merged implosion/gun type technology) as the energy source for the presumed gamma ray laser. And that limit is that the individual uranium componnts of any such device must remain subcritical during manufacturing and assembly. Whether consisting of a projectile and target (gun type) or hollow sphere or cylinder (implosion), if any component by itself or in proximity with other materials exceeds the critical mass for whatever isotopic makeup, geometry and chemical form the uranium is in, it would pre-detonate - a fizzle perhaps compared to weapons, but certainly enough to melt/vaporize itself and gamma/neutron irradiate the location. The maximum yield of a device composed of “just subcritical enough” components is … 1950’s technology. (We use tritium - boosted fission and lithium duteride fusion to exceed this limit). Then harvesting this fission energy as the trigger for gamma ray lazing? Even with 100% conversion efficiency, your gamma ray laser output is hundreds, of not thousands of orders of magnitude too small. If the entire earth was the uranium device, it would be too small. The entire output of the sun is too small - supernova are too small. Gamma ray bursts are known to be GALACTIC sized phenomena - one possibility being the result of galaxies merging and the coalessing of their central super-massive black holes. So, when speculating what could generate gamma ray bursts, it behooves one to learn first what gamma ray burst are. A single pulse in our direction, if there happened to be a burster nearby, would be an life extinction event - as in blowing off our entire atmosphere. No worries, there aint one anywhere in our local galactic cluster… (PHEW!)"},{"instruction":"What TV series are worth watching?","output":"Best playlist [LINKED_TEXT: Watch List \\"Stranger Things\\" (Netflix) \\"The Crown\\" (Netflix) \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" (Netflix) \\"Breaking Bad\\" (Netflix) \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" (Hulu) \\"Ga...https://shashankmax1498.blogspot.com/2023/01/watch-list.html] [URL: https://shashankmax1498.blogspot.com/2023/01/watch-list.html]"},{"instruction":"f I proved th","output":"There were MANY big floods in History in many places But The GREAT flood or Noah’s flood in The Bible was from a Middle Eastern perspective … The usual Timing of it according To The Holy Book was around 5000 years ago during Noah’s Time … Scripture said The Flood came when he was 600 years old ( Noah lived into his 900s … like Adam ) and scientists who are studying rock sediments on This all agreed it was a huge flood but not global … here is an Article : If the 3.4-meter–thick layer of flood deposits in southeastern Mesopotamia (MacDonald 1988) represents a huge flood of ancient times, and if it is the remnants of the one described in the early Babylonian epics, then the authors of these epics were likely survivors who lived in a village on natural levees on the lower parts of either the Euphrates or Tigris Rivers where the flood waters covered their village, natural levees, and adjacent flood plains for distances of 160 to 320 kilometers so that no land could be seen, and their \\"whole world\\" would have been under water…….

Are we discussing physics or perception? Acceleration is not gravity. Acceleration is a behavior of physical matter; gravity is always present whether or not the physical matter is present, as gravity is a property of space. The “thought experiment” of being in a box and not being able to discern the difference between acceleration and gravity is not physics. It is imagination. There is no physical world significance in knowing a person’s perception when working in physics. This is not to say that our perceptions cannot be quantified, as we clearly see that our perceptions can be quantified, such as with optics and the Doppler effect. But just because we can change our perception of a distant galaxy and make it appear closer to us does not make the galaxy physically closer. And neither does the movement of an observer relative to the medium change the speed of waves or frequency in the medium. When we allow our perceptions to taint our understanding of physical reality, we begin to see things that do not physically exist. There is no equivalence of gravity and acceleration just because a human cannot discriminate between them while enclosed in a box."},{"instruction":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","output":"I don't worry over my neighbor's lawn. mind your own business."},{"instruction":"What could have been done to make season 7 and 8 of Game of Thrones better?","output":"Season 6 could have been better too. After season 5, the quality of Game of Thrones gradually worsened. The sub plots became sillier and more effort was put in production values than the script. As a result, previously intriguing and smart characters like Tyrion, Little Finger and Varys stopped being so, becoming mundane and dull instead. I missed the witty lines of Tyrion and LF in the latter seasons. The character development of Daenerys in Essos was horrible and I'm never going to forget how the show did Stannis so dirty. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for action and gruesome battle scenes like Hardhome, Blackwater and Castle Black, all are absolutely thrilling and masterfully executed. But that shouldn't come at the cost of good writing. Because when that happens, we get crappy battle episodes like those in season 8. I feel that if the show runners had stuck to the books, the series would have been much better. They could have portrayed The Great Northern Conspiracy, saved Little Finger's potential by pairing him with Sansa to take over The Vale, and establish more concrete relations between Daenerys and Dorne. Let's just hope they don't butcher House of the Dragon as they did with GoT and The Witcher.

In Mahabharata, the warriors are multifaceted. Their goals keep changing every day. Someday everyone is trying to capture Yudhishtira. While on the other days, they are trying to protect Jayadratha etc. Hence, there is a lot of chaos added in the epic. I will probably rank them in following order. 10. Bheema - Bheema is only on the list who isn’t Maharathi. He is physically most powerful of this list. Bheema did try to stop Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwathama from time to time. Even though he has been defeated many times, he was never killed. It is said that any army which had Arjuna or Bheema will never be defeated. Bheema has been protector of Yudhisthira in the entire war. He has killed many Kaurava sons including Duryodhana and Dushasana. He has stopped Drona from capturing Yudhisthira. 9. Abhimanyu - Abhimanyu is worthy warrior. He battled Bhishma on the very first day and almost stalemated him. He has constantly defeated Duryodhana and rest of the members of Kaurava army save Bhishma, Karna and Drona. When Arjuna is taken away from the army center, Drona had created Chakravyuha which would have surely captured Yudhisthira and ended the war. Abhimanyu broke all 7 layers of the Chakravyuha killing thousands of Rathis and Atirathis. A chakravyuha is very complex battle formation to break. He was finally surrounded by Drona, Karna, Ashwathama, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Dushasana and Shalya (Dushasana’s son). Getting surrounded by multiple warriors is a routine occurrence during Drona parva. He was killed because he was alone. 8. Bhagadatta - He was repeatedly occurring character during the war. He killed more than 1 Akshauhini Pandava army. He did fight Arjuna multiple times. During their battle, he used Vaishnavastra on Arjuna which Lord Krishna countered. Arjuna didn’t know the counter for it so he was saved by Krishna. He was killed afterwards by Arjuna. 7. Satyaki - This Yadava warrior was student of Krishna and Drona. In the Kaurava army, he is probably the second most feared warrior after Arjuna. He has constantly taken on heavyweights of Kaurava army (Bhishma, Karna, Drona, Ashwathama). 6. Ashwathama - He is son of Drona. During the 18 days of the battle, he killed more than 1 Akshauhini army of Pandavas. He was routinely battling with Arjuna, Satyaki and Bheema (Panadava heavyweights). He is immortal. When Drona is killed unfairly, he becomes very angry and defeats almost all Pandava warriors except Arjuna. He uses Narayanastra and creates havoc in Pandava army. 5. Ghatotkacha (night time) - Ghatotkacha was present since day 1 in the battle. But during the daytime, he was not as feared as the Maharathis. During the night battle, being Asura, he could use all the illusions. He created Havoc on the 14th day during the night battle. Arjuna was battling with Drona. The entire Kaurava army was getting routed by Ghatotkacha. He faced Karna who was more than his match until Ghatotkacha started using his illusions. He killed Karna’s horses and Sarathi. Karna started becoming helpless and had to use Vasavi Shakti to kill him. Vasavi Shakti is once only usable Astra so Ghatotkacha did big favor to Arjuna by attacking Karna. 4. Drona - Now we are in unreal realm. All these warriors are almost unbeatable. It used to be said that Drona is unbeatable if he had even 1 weapon with him. He was very experienced Army General who used his army strategically. He has fought with Maharathis like Arjuna, Satyaki, Virata and other warriors like Bheema every day. He routinely defeated Dhrishtadyumna who had to run away every time. Although, he is ranked below the other three for two reasons. First is under him, all the rules of battle were broken. Multiple warriors started fighting a single warrior. The battles started going into the night. Astras like Brahmastra become frequently used in the battle. All these escalations finally lead to the killing of Abhimanyu under his leadership. Second reason is he was unable to capture Yudhisthira even in the absence of Arjuna. And when Arjuna was trying to kill Jayadratha, Drona didn’t follow him saying Arjuna’s speed is too much for his old body. 3. Karna - He was most feared warrior from Kaurava army simply because he had vowed to kill Arjuna. Bhishma was unbeatable but he fought softly vs Pandavas. His results on the battlefield are mixture of good and bad results. He wasn’t allowed to enter the war until 11th day. From the day he had entered, he routinely fought vs Satyaki, Bheema, and Arjuna. He used to take on many warriors together, at one time taking on all the above mentioned Pandava warriors single handedly. He had stalemated Arjuna on some occasions while Arjuna was more focused on Drona or Jayadratha other times. He defeated Bhima, and other Pandavas but let them go. On 14th day during battle vs Ghatotkacha, he was really into his element. He was countering many illusions created by Ghatotkacha and holding his own while entire Kaurava army was routed. He killed Ghatotkacha in the end. He also entered day 17 with Vijaya bow for the first time. That day the battle became so fierce that even Arjuna fainted for a brief moment. Ultimately Karna was killed when he was trying to remove wheel of his chariot from the ground. He had participated in Duryodhana’s plans and had sinned which resulted in him getting multiple curses. Despite those curses, he held his own during Kurukshetra war vs Arjuna. 2. Bhishma - He was the grandfather of Pandavas and Kauravas. Being the eldest Kuru, he fought softly vs Pandavas. He routinely defeated great warriors like Satyaki, Abhimanyu, Bheema and all. He was invincible in the battle. Under him, the Kurukshetra war casualties reached 100 million. He was never beaten in the whole 10 days and always protected his army. He might be great warrior but his indecisiveness was the reason Kauravas could neither win nor lose the battle. His fame came when on day 3, Lord Krishna broke his vow to attack him. 1, Arjuna - what else can be said about this warrior? He is the best among the best. He is equal to Karna in fierceness. He is equal to Bhishma in invincibility. He is equal to Drona in war strategies. He is one man army. He single handedly routed Pandava army on multiple occasions. Where Arjuna’s chariot went, destruction followed. He was feared like lord Mahadeva himself. Arjuna battled vs all heavyweights of Kauravas including Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwathama, Bhagadatta, and others. He killed Jayadratha in a single day of epicness, running from one end of the Kaurava army to other end battling vs all the warriors and ultimately killing Jayadratha. An entire army of Kauravas was not able to save Jayadratha when Arjuna was angry. Ashwathama and other Maharathis ran and hid from the fear of Arjuna. He was probably the most compassionate warrior from this list. He didn’t want to kill Drona because he was the teacher. He didn’t want to hurt Ashwathama because he was son of Drona. He didn’t want to wound Bhishma because he was the grandfather. Krishna had to encourage him to fight vs his family members. The kauravas had very good number of maharathis but one by one they started dying. When Bhishma was wounded, they still had Karna entering the battle. When Drona was killed, all hopes were on Karna. But after the death of Karna, they were morally defeated.While Pandavas had lost Abhimanyu, Ghatotkacha, Panchala and Virata kings. But they always had Arjuna. Arjuna is bigger than an entire army so Pandavas were never in doubt about who will win.

I guess it was 4 or 5 years ago when we were struggling with no income and no work but only paying money for studying at the college, monthly rents and all these basic life huge expenses. Back then, a friend of my mom told us about a center (which was more like an office) where you can register for a course (English, French .. extra) by only paying 20 JD and in return, you get the course with a certificate and 200 JD per month. According to the owner of the center, these courses were funded by an Emirati prince and it was one way to help refugees get money and being educated at the same time. The owner, who was a female professor in one of these big universities (Her name is Safa’a), brought Brochures that proof she is not lying. And of course, anyone who needed help, like us and many other refugees, believed her. So, we paid around 100 JD (My sisters and I applied). We started attending these courses, they didn’t have good teachers so they hired my big sister to teach English and to work full-time as a secretary. My mom told all her Syrian friends about this center and I think around 30 people or so applied to this center, they didn’t even attend the courses or needed the certificate, they just needed the money. After less than a month, my big sister felt unsafe with Safa’a’s attitude, since Safa’a used to leave her office for long hours, go to a cafeteria near the office and spend her time smoking shisha, then she would come back to the office, meet with many people arguing with her and then leave her office with anger. A couple of times my sister witnessed situations where 2 or 3 families were asking for their money but Safa’a kept saying “If you want money I will sue you and will put you in Za’atari camp”, people would feel afraid, give up and leave. My sister finally discovered that this lady was lying and there wouldn’t be any money for refugees, so she worked there for a month as an English teacher then she quit her job. When she left, she told Safa’a “I know you are lying and I am telling everyone about you”. After a couple of days, my mom’s friend called us and said that my big sister has stolen all the money from Safa’a’s office (that’s what Safa’a claimed to anyone who would call her office to ask for the money). Of course, no one believed that since all of our friends knew us for a long time. We couldn’t even defend ourselves since Safa’a had a lot of connections and if you want to sue her, she would use her connections to kick you out of Jordan forever. So we had explained the situation for others via social media and just prevented many people from applying to this center. After a few months, we heard of a guy who wanted to sue Safa’a because he faced the same problem with her and he needed people to help him witness that Safa’a is a fraudster in a session at the court, my sister agreed on going to the court and help this guy. Before the date of the session at the court, we were informed that this guy was imprisoned and the session was canceled. We couldn’t do anything to help him get out, but we heard that he left after a few weeks. Currently, this lady is still doing the same frauds to other people but she uses different tricks. All we can do is telling people about her frauds and what she did before. Thank god people believe us, but I am not sure what happened for those who have already fallen in her tricks."},{"instruction":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","output":"You don’t even understand what it is you are so against.

It transcends the boundaries of time and culture, yet its true essence remains a mystery that defies our attempts at complete understanding. In its vast complexity, love intertwines elements of philosophy, psychology, sociology, and spirituality, weaving a tapestry that continues to fascinate and confound us. From a philosophical perspective, love sparks contemplation about its very nature and purpose. Philosophers have grappled with questions such as: What is the essence of love? Is it a force inherent in the fabric of the universe, guiding our interactions and shaping our destinies? Or is it a construct created by human perception, an emotional response to our longing for connection and meaning? As we explore these inquiries, we encounter a labyrinth of interpretations, each revealing a fragment of love's enigma but failing to capture its entirety. Delving into the realm of psychology, we confront the intricate interplay of emotions, motivations, and neural processes that underlie the experience of love. It manifests in an array of forms - from the euphoria of new romance to the profound bond of familial love and the enduring connections of friendship. Love influences our thoughts, colors our perceptions, and profoundly shapes our sense of self. Yet, as we endeavor to comprehend the mechanisms behind love's captivating grip, we encounter a web of complexities that resist complete elucidation. The impact of love extends far beyond the individual, reverberating through the intricate tapestry of society. Love shapes our interpersonal relationships, serving as a cornerstone of human connection and social cohesion. It permeates cultural norms, rituals, and traditions, embedding itself in the very fabric of our communities. Love has the power to bridge divides, heal wounds, and ignite positive change, yet the dynamics by which it exerts its influence on a collective scale remain elusive. Furthermore, love ventures into the spiritual realm, captivating seekers of truth and enlightenment. Across diverse faiths and belief systems, love is regarded as a profound spiritual force, transcending the boundaries of the material world. It is seen as a unifying energy, a divine essence that permeates all creation. Love becomes a pathway to transcendence, an avenue for connecting with a higher power or achieving a deeper understanding of the self and the universe. Yet, as we explore the spiritual dimensions of love, we encounter the limitations of language and human comprehension in capturing its transcendent nature. In acknowledging the limits of our understanding, we embrace the expansiveness of love's mystery. We recognize that love cannot be confined to a set of definitions or fully grasped by the rational mind. It beckons us to explore its depths, to surrender to its enigmatic allure, and to open ourselves to its transformative power. Love becomes a journey, a continuous exploration of the intricacies of the heart and the connections that bind us to one another and to the world. In the very recognition of love's unfathomable depths, we find liberation and inspiration. We are called to cultivate love in all its forms - love for ourselves, for others, for the natural world. We learn to navigate the complexities of vulnerability, to embrace compassion and empathy, and to honor the sacredness of human connection. Love becomes an invitation to transcend our limitations, to embrace the unknown, and to embark on a lifelong quest for understanding and growth. As we journey through the mysteries of love, we encounter joy and heartache, passion and sacrifice, unity and longing. We are reminded of the profound capacity within each of us to both give and receive love, and the transformative power that lies within its embrace. Love becomes not merely an intellectual pursuit but a profound and deeply personal experience, a force that shapes our lives and gives them meaning. So, as we ponder the depths of love's immeasurability, let us surrender to the journey, embracing the wonder, the complexity, and the sheer vastness of this inexplicable force. Let us cherish the moments of connection, nurture the bonds that enrich our lives, and strive to embody love's essence in all that we do. For in the pursuit of understanding love, we embark on a lifelong exploration of the human experience, forever entwined with the uncharted territories of the heart and soul."},{"instruction":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","output":"Stir-frying is usually at the highest temp to which you can crank up your stove.

One of the most interesting aspects of Iran Constitutional Revolution was the participation of Caucasians in the struggle. Georgians, Russians and even more Armenians and Caucasian Muslims (who later were called Azeri) had an important role especially in the battles against the Shah in North Western Iran. But unfortunately the history went in a way in 20th century that 2 nations (Iran and Azerbaijan Republic) got far from each other. Bolsheviks took power in Russia. The same intellectuals that had helped us (Rasul Zadeh, Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, etc) named the country ‘Azerbaijan’. This created hostility between Iranian nationalist intellectuals and them.Modern nationalism emerged. Iran tried to emphasize on just Persian while Azeris in north of Aras and their literature was influenced by Russia.Hostility between USSR and Iran cut off the relation more than before.Since 1990s that nations in the Caucasus gained their sovereignty, Iran and Azerbaijan Republic were not in good relation. Iran of course has its own role in terrifying belligerence. Yesterday someone commented below one of my answers. I went to see that how much this claim is true. Before starting to explain more, I should say as a Turk from Iran, I respect Armenian nation and their sovereignty. I also know a little about Armenian history and noble dynasties. I believe Armenians as a nation with unique culture (different religion and language) who were able to preserve their culture in centuries were and are entitled to an independent state. So referring to population of Yerevan is not for questioning Armenian nation’s sovereignty. Yerevan was always Armenian land and will remain Armenian land.

And Yerevan just 40 years later was annexed to Russia. For the mosque's construction, various dates from the mid-18th century are cited in literature. As reported by 19th-century traveller H.F.B. Lynch, the Blue Mosque was commissioned to be built during the reign of Iranian ruler Nadir Shah (1736–47) by Husayn Ali Khan. George Bournoutian names Husayn Ali Khan as the patron of the building, but places his reign in the years 1762-83. According to Vladimir M. Arutyunyan et al. construction started in 1760 and was completed under Husayn Ali Khan in 1764-68. Also just have a look to population of Yerevan در سال ۱۸۹۷، در شهر ایروان ۲۹،۰۰۶ نفر سکونت داشتند، که ۱۲،۵۲۳ از آن‌ها ارامنه، ۱۲،۳۵۹ نفر را آذربایجانی‌ها تشکیل می‌دادند. [LINKED_TEXT: با توجه به سرشماری امپراتوری روسیه] [URL: http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/emp_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=570] در سال ۱۸۹۷، آذربایجانی‌ها (تاتارها) تا ۱۲،۰۰۰ نفر (۴۱٪) از ۲۹،۰۰۰ نفر جمعیت ایروان را شامل می‌شدند. با این حال، در دوره پاکسازی‌های قومی سیستماتیک در طول سال‌های بسیار و مهاجرت ارامنه از ایران و امپراتوری عثمانی، پایتخت ارمنستان با جمعیت فراوان ارمنی روبرو شد. با توجه به سرشماری سال ۱۹۵۹، ارامنه تا ۹۶ درصد از جمعیت کشور و در سال ۱۹۸۹ بیش از ۹۶،۵ درصد را شامل می‌شدند. و آذربایجانی‌ها تنها ۰،۱ درصد از جمعیت ایروان در سال ۱۹۸۹ تشکیل می‌دادند. تغییرات جمعیتی اجباری در ایروان با کمک ناسیونالیست‌های ارمنی از حزب \\"فدراسیون انقلابی ارمنی\\" اجرا شد. آن‌ها جمعیت ایروان به نفع ارامنه با تهدید و ارعاب مسلمانان محلی تغییر دادند. به عنوان نتیجه یک پاکسازی قومی، نه تنها آذربایجانی‌ها از ایروان دور رانده شدند، بلکه مسجد آذربایجانی‌ها در ایروان نیز نابود شد. In 1897, population of Yerevan was 29006. 12523 of which were Armenian and 12359 were Azerbaijani. In the census done by Russian Empire in 1897, Azerbaijanis (Tatars) constituted about 12000 (41%) of Yerevan population. However due to ethnic cleansing in years and migration of Armenians from Iran and Ottoman Empire, Armenian population in Yerevan increased. Based on 1959 census, 96% of Armenia were Armenian and in 1989, 96.5% of population was constituted of Armenians. Azerbaijanis constituted only 0.1% of Yerevan population in 1989. Compulsory demographic changes in Yerevan was done by the help of Armenian nationalists from “Armenian Revolutionary Federation” party and by threatening and Intimidation of local Muslims. Due to ethnic cleansing not only Azerbaijanis were expelled from Yerevan but also their mosque in Yerevan was ruined. با خروج کامل آذری‌ها، زندگی و فرهنگ آذری نیز در ارمنستان متوقف شد. همچنین اقداماتی مانند تخریب مسجدی در خیابان واردانانتس ایروان به سال ۱۹۹۰ توسط بولدزر انجام شد. مسجد کبود ایروان که تنها مسجد باقی‌مانده در ایروان است پس از دهه ۱۷۶۰ در اختیار آذربایجانی‌ها قرار داشت، که پس از استقلال ارمنستان و اخراج آذری‌ها، اداره مسجد در اختیار مسئولین ایرانی قرار گرفت. و نام‌های جغرافیایی با ریشه ترکی به نام ارمنی تغییر یافت. علاوه بر این از سال ۱۹۳۰ به بعد نیز تمامی اماکن جغرافیایی با ریشه زبان‌های ترکی‌تبار به زبان ارمنی تغییرمی‌یافت. برخی عناصر نیز سعی در پاک کردن واقعیت تاریخی سکونت مسلمانان در بخش قابل توجهی از ارمنستان را از نظر جمعیت محلی آنجا داشتند. By complete immigration of Azeris from Armenia, Azeri life and culture stopped in Armenia. Also a mosque in Yerevan (Vardantes street) was destroyed in 1990 Bulldozer.

I take it that you mean: Is it more feasible to live on the ceiling of a fast rotating asteroid than on a specially constructed colony station? Let’s limit the cost and just compare the utility. Advantages of the space colony: We have designed the colony to rotate at a certain speed and that creates the desired 1g gravity. The station is big enough that we are not distressed by the different gravities at our head and feet levels. The station has an additional track that allows us to gradually get up to 1g. After a long space journey the two tracks enable us to get ready to return to Earth’s gravity. They also allow us to get used to walking. Probably this would be designed to be ideal for getting used to returning to Earth’s gravity and walking. It would be surprising indeed of an asteroid could be found to do this job and be an Earth satellite as well. On the other hand a hollowed out asteroid could be selected so as to block radiation. Here we have a space environment that could be designed for living indefinite periods of time. For long trips in the solar system this might be ideal.

The average Canadian has 6.8 interactions with the healthcare system per year. The most obvious way that the system regulates unnecessary visits to the doctor is that the doctor will tell the patient that they don’t wish to see the patient for a period of time unless something serious occurs. Doctors are busy and pointless visits cost them potential income. If a doctor wishes, they can simply ask the patient to make an appointment for a specific period into the future. This gives the patient the feeling that their concerns are being looked at, but relieves some of the anxiety that may result in excessive visits. Some provinces have instituted a common EMR system, where the entire health system has access to the patient’s health history (with strong privacy measures). This one-patient, one-chart system means that every visit can be tracked, identifying those who require closer scrutiny to identify the reason why a patient is using the health system at above average frequencies. Some of these patients may qualify for extramural programs. Extramural programs involve visits by healthcare professionals outside the doctor’s office or hospital. These nurses, paramedics or therapists can significantly reduce visits to the doctor or emergency department. As a whole, the higher number of visits to the healthcare system in Canada result in better prevention and better outcomes than in the US. Unnecessary visits constitute a relatively small number of health system interactions."},{"instruction":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","output":"Napalm Girl by Nick Ut This picture immediately came into my mind when I saw this question. It is one of the most recognised pictures in the world. It shows a little naked Vietnamese girl crying as she runs towards the camera; she is crying and screaming in agony after a napalm attack incinerated her village, her clothes, and later her skin. It is often the picture that people associate with the slaughter of innocent women and children in the Vietnam War. The little village in South Vietnam was hit by South Vietnamese forces, as it had been reportedly taken over by North Vietnamese forces. Unfortunately, South Vietnam ended up injuring many of its own civilians. Many people think that this was the end of the story and assume that nothing else was done to help the people in the picture. However, the story continues. The girl is called Kim Phúc, she was still running when ITN (later BBC) journalist Christopher Wain stopped her and poured water over her while directing his crew to record the terrible scenes. Christopher helped Kim Phúc while his crew continued to capture the horrific scenes. When speaking about the experience he said: \\"We were short of (camera) film and my cameraman, the late, great Alan Downes, was worried that I was asking him to waste precious film shooting horrific pictures which were too awful to use. My attitude was that we needed to show what it was like, and to their lasting credit, ITN ran the shots.\\" Nick Ut then took Kim Phúc and the other injured children that we can see in the picture to the British-run Saigon First Children's Hospital. When she got there it was determined that Kim Phúc’s injuries were so severe that she would need an extensive hospital stay, and would be lucky if she remained alive. In total it is estimated that she stayed in hospital care for 14 months and had 17 surgeries in order to get her into a fit state to return home. It was not until later in 1982, after having treatment in a specialist German clinic that Kim Phúc was able to move fully again. There are lesser known pictures taken by other photographers that show the before and after of the ‘Napalm Girl’ photo, and can be used to further tell the story. Many of them were taken by Alan Downes. Kim Phúc now lives in Canada with her husband after being granted political asylum. On November 10, 1994, Kim Phúc was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador; she has used her platform to talk about how the Vietnam War affected her not just physically, but also spiritually. In 1999 Denise Chong released a biography of Kim Phúc’s experiences thus far called ‘The Girl in the Picture’. She has gone on to establish the Kim Phuc Foundation, which provides medical and psychological assistance to child victims of war.

It’s the NHS that contacts patients reminding them that it’s time for a breast scan, or cervical smear, or to provide a sample of faeces to check for colon cancer. It’s in the interest of the NHS to catch cancer early, preferably before the patient even knows about it, because that is when it’s easiest, cheapest and most effective to treat it.

If you are hoping to get the same performance, resolution, and band sharpness from agar as you do from agarose you will be disappointed. This is because agarose is purified to be free from (or low in) charged molecules that can interfere with band migration. Also, if you are trying to use DNA fragments isolated from gels in cloning then the impurities in agar may inhibit the enzymes used. However, if you are looking for a low-cost alternative to agarose for a teaching lab then it may be ok to use agar as a demonstration of electrophoresis. See the article below on setting up a low-cost demonstration lab using materials that can be found in stores such a grocery or hardware stores and pet supply stores. They use agar, a hand-made gel box made from a plastic tray and aluminum foil, fish tank buffers, and a power supply made from five 9-volt batteries hooked up in series: [LINKED_TEXT: Inexpensive and safe DNA gel electrophoresis using household materials] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596] Horizontal submerged DNA gels are typically made of agarose, a purified form of agar composed of only neutral carbohydrate chains. One concern with using agar, rather than agarose, for gel electrophoresis is that charged carbohydrates in agar could cause bands to become diffuse due to electro‐osmosis [[LINKED_TEXT: 13] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596#bib13], [LINKED_TEXT: 14] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596#bib14]]. This has not been a noticeable problem for the agars examined here. Agar is a vegetable (algal) gelatin powder, often called agar‐agar, available in natural or Asian food stores and online. While Now brand agar (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) or BactoAgar (Difco) are suitable, Telephone brand agar‐agar (Sirian International, Bangkok, Thailand) performed best. Agar‐agar from Eden Foods (Clinton, MI) and Desi Mills (Toronto, CA) did not perform as well.

Since losing the election on November 3, 2020, Trump has besmirched the presidency and America itself through continuous seditious actions. Events last Wednesday further represent the culmination of his despicable conduct since mid autumn. Yup, Trump has crossed the line numerous times the past couple months, but what transpired on Jan 6, 2021 is totally unacceptable for a civilised nation. At a certain point soon, Americans must confront an uncomfortable fact: that they basically elected a criminal as their 45th president. Sure, politics is most often a sloppy affair, but Trump has drug it below the lowest levels of cesspools. What should one conclude from Trump’s endless attempts at undermining election results? The plethora of nonsensical litigation doesn’t reflect a pursuit of justice, but an aversion toward it. Finally, I’ll note how Trudeau commented about “the common greater good”, and contrast that with an American ethos the past four decades that’s viewed it in hostile terms. Trump has been many things the past four years, but America’s president isn’t one of the them; quite the contrary, he’s been the president of his congregation only, and America currently languishes on account of this.

See Mumbai, despite being Maharashtra’s capital, Hindi is widely spoken and understood. Thus it attracts people from North. In-fact during summer vacation even railway officers are unable to get tickets to the North. Since UP/BIhar people are poor, they are ready to cut corners and work for a very low pay. Besides 90% of the labors leave their family behind and move to Mumbai, thus they could dedicate long hours besides lower pay. Thus business men prefer to employ them. This in many case rubs the localites in the wrong way. However the real issue starts when these people form a significant number and try to dominate. AKA get into politics. SP leader Abu Azmi gave provocative speech and started flexing muscles in Maharashtra, thus directly triggering regional parties like MNS, etc. The same issue is feared by people from rest of the country.

Josef Mengele published some works about hereditary diseases before the war, but he took his documents from Auschwitz when escaping and they probably were destroyed later. So no known “great progress” in any science were done by him. From what is known from his former co-workers, his experiments on humans were probably worthless from a scientific point of view."},{"instruction":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","output":"Your question makes no sense. Immigrant is a status of citizenship. Foreigners who want to enter the US legally have many options available to them depending on what they plan to do here. These status’s include, immigrant, migrant, refugee and asylum seeker. These status’s are given to foreigners who have applied for them and been approved. This means, they have legally entered the country and have the documents to prove it. There is no such person who can be described as an “undocumented” immigrant. All immigrants are documented. The only foreigners in our country who are undocumented are referred to as “illegal aliens”. When you view immigrants as undocumented your showing your ignorance and creating racism.

While individuals like Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel have muscular and visually impressive physiques, they have achieved those bodies through specialized training, nutrition, and often with the help of professional trainers and dedicated time for workouts. On the other hand, elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo rigorous training programs that focus on developing a wide range of physical attributes, such as endurance, strength, agility, and speed. Their training involves a combination of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, flexibility training, and skills specific to their operational requirements. Maintaining an extremely muscular body like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel often requires a specific approach to training and nutrition that might not be conducive to the demands of military service. Elite soldiers and Navy SEALs need to be able to endure long periods of physical exertion, carry heavy gear, perform complex maneuvers, and adapt to various challenging environments. Their training is designed to enhance overall performance and combat effectiveness rather than to prioritize bulking up for aesthetics. Moreover, having an extremely muscular physique can sometimes be a disadvantage in certain military operations. Bulky muscles can limit mobility, increase fatigue, and hinder performance in tasks that require agility and flexibility. Soldiers and Navy SEALs need to be versatile, capable of performing various physical tasks efficiently, and able to sustain high levels of performance for extended periods. It's important to note that while elite soldiers and Navy SEALs may not have the same physiques as actors like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel, they possess exceptional levels of fitness and possess the skills necessary to excel in their respective military roles. Their training and conditioning focus on functional strength, endurance, and combat-related skills rather than solely on aesthetics."},{"instruction":"Can an employer continue to ask for help once an employee has resigned?","output":"Sure can.

I popped into quora to find a spot to bring this up and this will work. They seem to stand by their word of being.. charitable. Let's use that. They try to help those less well off than they are. It's not why I'm looking at becoming a member insofar as taking advantage of that, not financially. Wasn't really looking for a job either. I despise work. But, when they came to me it wasn't long before something about a dream job came up on my end. My guys brought it up, and its gotta do with those masons. My occult brought them to me so the real world masons may or may not know how it is. On their own world, they see it as an interview. Them checking my qualifications and what not. Could be I've got that, I dunno. All I know is they ask that I be truthful when that happens. Nothing is always true. Saying nothing is my only hope. They asked. But it puts me in the position of being a part of this team. They say they are all the same but I'm having a hard time holding this one up. I hear after joining they begin learning about you. They want your input, and they use symbols to get that. Powerful way to do that, being as they don't know anything about it either. It being you or me or whatever. That Process is gonna give them power over you. So I guess that's it. You'll be at a disadvantage. That's the thing. They've got arcane knowledge, probably loaded with it. Being as I handled your question I'm going to use the rest of my time here to handle my end. I've got something to say, no idea how to even broach the subject with them, and fact is my truth isn't the whole one. I'm not in the position they are. Not really. But our circumstances are the same and from the looks of things they've had as much luck as I have. They want to change the problem, erase it. A help them help themselves thing. It's what they say. Knowledge is power thing. Show them how to do it, for themselves. They've changed who they fundamentally are, erased the problem. Changed who they are, the goal being to erase them. It is what it is. And they want them to do it to themselves because they've figured out that's the only way to actually make it happen. It sounds good. Sounds. Until one looks at what really happen. They've wiped them out. And got them to do it to themselves. Sure, they're ‘better off’. It's what they wanted, right? Or is it? Having the perspective I have, I'm poor too, and also being I wasn't born in a disadvantaged family, like many of them weren't I have a bit of both ends. I managed to drag myself out of the worst of it but still qualify as poor and disadvantaged. My disabilities to the same conclusion through other means. So, these masons and I have even more in common. They're good for me to get to know. Now let's look at where I'm at. Well, part of it. I'm alone. Family gone, no friends. A big part of why I've got no friends is I chose needy ones and tried to do the same these masons are trying to do. Had a little luck but nothing to brag about. The fact I compare myself unfavorably wasn't exactly an asset either. I don't know what to do. Done a lot of that nonsense and I'm interested in being able to do it with my own experiences hoping to find out otherwise. Being a charity case, well the poor will take what they can get but kinda makes them feel bad. For a few reasons too. Charity has its place but I think it's being misused here. The end game doesn't really look charitable either. It looks like extinction. I've a proposal in regards to this. I think it wouldn't hurt to try this out but it would put me in a big position to work with the right people to get a job that would work for me and test it out. That could be this dream job my guys are so excited about. Personally I'm not sure if it is a good idea. It's how they look at me when I tell you what's up. They are, no doubt. The me I am right now, it's not good enough. I'm a good person, even better I've got a heart of gold, but that kind of better isn't what it boiled down to do that for me. It wasn't enough, it made things even harder. For me and those around me too. I don't want trouble with that once I get it to do what I need to do. Make a difference, and one that everyone can get behind. A difference perspective if you want to see. Lemme illustrate something with the other people in this thing. First off, it's not a bad idea. It's not. But, it's gonna take away your customers. No poor=no charitable in this thing. It's not needed, problem handled. Is that really the goal here? The thrill of accomplishment will fade. The business will be more successful suppressing the way you do it. And I get it, you don't want to have them tugging at your pants leg all the time asking for it. It's infuriating. I can't take it. I still try here and there but this isn't sustainable for me. I'm losing. I get triggered faster and react faster. Might be they feel differently, I dunno. The only option I see is… well, as the saying goes nothing is for free in this world. Saying more here is just giving it away and no one really wants to be a part of that. It looks like it. I'm betting there's is a chance it's so obvious they missed it. Under their nose. And what do I know, right? That's my dilemma, the disadvantage being I'd likely have to change or something like that. I've been known to try and clearly it doesn't work for me or others. I'm choosing to believe I've got something. Why not, right? Haven't seen it myself yet. I'd probably need to give them their chance to at least do their process with me. Process. My friend said they do that. I'm familiar with something called the process. Stripped me to make sure that the only thing I would have had to give is the power of my own experiences. Experience is what I've got, and that.. well it's suited for me to get to work with and then I will have a good idea about what to expect from my end. Well that is what I have been working on and I don't want trouble with it anymore. Found out about it and shared it with the world in a way they did not want me in the real world. I need a better understanding of what they'd like to go through with me. So thats my job for now.

Most important aspect about the placebo effect is it exists even without a placebo, i.e., operates regardless whether the Rx is a highly specialized and well-validated drug with a known mechanism of action or a real procedure on the one hand or placebo or sham procedure on the other. In other words, ipso facto, drug effects include placebo effects. For those that wish to cure Parkinson's naturally without hamrful medication, you should [LINKED_TEXT: check this tutorial] [URL: https://cutt.ly/zGqOzqJ]. I have good results with it. I trudged around for 40 months taking a full amount of PD drugs; i.e., Sinemet, Mirapex, Amantadine and Comtan, then Stalevo and several others from time to time. The retail value of these drugs calculated at the frequency and strength prescribed was 1,000 per month. I have followed that method and as a result, I now have a strong sense of well-being. . . It is now so difficult to express the joy which flows from feeling well after having previously asked the daily question, 'Am I ever going to have a good day again?' Before starting that method I had suffered from a general malaise and depression for about four years. I had poor posture and poor motor skills, such as cutting meat on a plate, trouble rolling over in bed. I was stone-faced with little or no expression. Basically, all that (symptoms) has abated and gone. I can smile just like the pretty girls now. I can roll over in bed. However, for too long, placebo effect research got bogged down in what placebos are, i.e., placebo pill or sham treatment content took precedence over the context in which treatments, be they real or placebo, are given. Placebo context or placebo ritual encompasses all the disparate elements of any treatment environment including beliefs, expectations, past experiences, not just the patient's but also the physician's (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 1] [URL: http://www.thblack.com/links/RSD/Lancet2010_375_686_AdvancesOfPlaceboEffects.pdf]) and everyone else involved in it. The focus of cutting-edge placebo research is to uncover and understand the components and processes of this effect. Change in focus from placebo content to context is not only unprecedented but has the potential to truly revolutionize medicine, if it gets the attention it surely deserves like none other but which it unfortunately doesn't get, given the perennial short-sightedness of biomedicine funders, and biotech and pharma companies. And of course, the medical community also needs to get on board with what the latest in placebo effects research teaches us about how medicines actually work, as in how much a person's psychological response to being treated plays a major role in a treatment's effectiveness. How To Study Placebo Effects [LINKED_TEXT: Randomized controlled trial] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial] (RCT) which are also [LINKED_TEXT: Placebo-controlled study] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study] don't help understand the placebo effect since that isn't really their focus. Rather they merely seek to account for the placebo fait accompli in order to more accurately assess the 'real' treatment's effect. As well, many of them don't include the key no treatment group necessary to assess the magnitude of the placebo effect separately. However, comparing placebo and no treatment groups doesn't fully reveal the entirety of placebo effects either. An early placebo effects RCT (2) found the cholecystokinin antagonist [LINKED_TEXT: Proglumide] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglumide] to be more effective against post-operative pain compared to placebo. So far so good. However, this study, done by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Fabrizio Benedetti] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Benedetti], included a further group, those who got proglumide but weren't told about it, i.e., a hidden treatment group. Such patients reported no alleviation of their pain, even though they'd received the same dose of painkiller! How to explain this? When given openly, proglumide presumably interacts with and enhances expectation pathways, i.e., one type of placebo effect. In other words, proglumide doesn't act on pain pathways itself and thus is only effective when combined with psychosocial mechanisms operating during physician-patient interactions. A Representative Example Of Experiments That Uncover & Study Placebo Effects Separately From Placebo A pioneering placebo effect study by the groundbreaking placebo researcher, [LINKED_TEXT: Ted Kaptchuk] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaptchuk], in this RCT on 262 [LINKED_TEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome] (IBS) patients, placebo effects were separated into their 2 main components or combined together and compared to no treatment ([LINKED_TEXT: 3] [URL: http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/336/7651/999.full.pdf]). Placebo ritual alone: a validated placebo acupuncture device which retracts into the needle handle instead of penetrating the skin.Placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The latter consisted of a prospectively scripted process that entailed attention, warmth, confidence and thoughtful silence. 3 weeks into the trial, using a validated measure for IBS, patients reporting improvement were 28% in the no treatment group.44% in the placebo ritual group alone.62% in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship. The 62% improvement seen in the placebo ritual plus patient-clinician relationship was similar to that seen in an earlier RCT where patients were treated with [LINKED_TEXT: Alosetron] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alosetron], a drug used for IBS Rx ([LINKED_TEXT: 4] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Camilleri7/publication/12572423_Camilleri_M_Northcutt_AR_Kong_S_et_al._Efficacy_and_safety_of_alosetron_in_women_with_irritable_bowel_syndrome_A_randomized_placebo-controlled_trial._Lancet_20003551035-1040/links/55a4ec1508ae00cf99c932af.pdf]). In other words, this study's placebo effects were just as effective as active IBS Rx was reported to have been in a previous study. What kind of experimental design helps uncover, maybe even quantify, placebo effects, which operate regardless of real medication or placebo? The Open-Hidden Study Design. First, to consider that any medical treatment has specific and non-specific effects. The latter could ensue simply from knowledge that a treatment's being given, i.e., expectation.Second, assess the treatment's effectiveness byEliminating its specific effect, i.e., a placebo study: No active Rx, only placebo.Eliminating non-specific effects, i.e., hidden treatment: Active Rx but patient doesn't know. Called the Open-Hidden Study Design (see below from [LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf]), this experiment design has thus far best elucidated magnitude and duration of placebo effects, and uncovered their two main drivers, expectations and classic conditioning, i.e., learning. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Expectations Of Symptom Improvement Consider a physician-administered drug. In open treatment, the physician injects the drug into the patient openly with normal verbal and contextual interactions, i.e., complete representation of routine physician-patient psychosocial interaction.In hidden treatment, patient gets the drug infused via a computer pump in the absence of a physician and the therapeutic context. Hidden treatment patients only know they're supposed to get a drug injection at some point, not when. Thus they don't experience the expectation component and other contextual factors associated with their treatment. With such a design the placebo component is defined as the difference between open and hidden treatments, even though no placebo is given ([LINKED_TEXT: 5] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/8229264_Overt_versus_covert_treatment_for_pain_anxiety_and_Parkinson%27s_disease/links/542bfc650cf27e39fa91c712.pdf], 6). Several open-hidden studies on painkillers such as [LINKED_TEXT: Buprenorphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac], [LINKED_TEXT: Metamizole] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamizole], [LINKED_TEXT: Morphine] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine], [LINKED_TEXT: Tramadol] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol] found hidden treatment markedly less effective compared to open treatment. One study had open versus hidden pain treatment groups among both healthy and post-operative patients ([LINKED_TEXT: 7] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/12124633_Response_Variability_to_Analgesics_A_Role_for_Non-Specific_Activation_of_Endogenous_Opiods/links/09e41505b1605c85e3000000.pdf]).Healthy volunteers (n=86) subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]): Hidden treatment group had higher pain ratings.Post-thoracic surgery patients (n=278) with post-operative pain: Hidden treatment group needed much higher doses of pain medication to reduce pain by 50%. One study examined effect of open versus hidden treatment with morphine among 42 patients with post-operative pain, open versus hidden treatment with [LINKED_TEXT: Diazepam] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam] among 30 thoracotomized patients with anxiety, and open versus hidden stimulations of the subthalamic nucleus in 10 Parkinson's patients (8).In all these cases, pain medications were much less effective in the hidden treatment groups.In all these cases, the open treatment condition differed from the hidden one in three important parameters, namely, patient was aware of the treatment, the therapist was present in the room and thus patient had an expectation of the outcome. Studies on painful rectal distention balloon in IBS patients given local anesthetic or placebo found subtle manipulation of expectations directly influenced placebo response magnitude. In one study (9), patients were told they 'may receive an active or placebo agent’.In the other study ([LINKED_TEXT: 10] [URL: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.4595&rep=rep1&type=pdf]), they were told 'the agent you have been given is known to significantly reduce pain in some patients’.The second study with the more specific instructions elicited stronger placebo responses. Implication: Better defined, more specific instructions may improve treatment response. One study ([LINKED_TEXT: 11] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/11934203_Response_expectancies_in_placebo_analgesia_and_their_clinical_relevance/links/0912f505b1444f1bab000000.pdf]) assessed post-operative pain alleviation. Intravenous (iv) saline was the placebo, buprenorphine on request the standard analgesic Rx. Patients were divided into three groups Group One was told iv saline was a rehydrating solution.Group Two that it was a powerful painkiller.Group Three that it may or may not be a powerful painkiller.Group Two took 33% less buprenorphine compared to Group One.Group Three took 20% less buprenorphine compared to Group One. Implication: Active Rx plus placebo effects could reduce total analgesic usage. Open-Hidden Study Design Reveals Placebo Effects Can Ensue From Learning To Expect Symptom Improvement, i.e., Pre-Conditioning For long, the assumption prevailed that in order to work, placebos required deception or concealment. Pioneering placebo effects studies show this isn't so, that they entail learning processes that allow placebos to work in reducing symptoms even with patients knowing about them. In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 12] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Colloca/publication/7079500_How_prior_experience_shapes_placebo_analgesia/links/0deec5204375cbc27c000000.pdf]), 30 healthy right-handed volunteers were given pain stimulus (electric shock) to their non-dominant hand. At the same time, placebo effect was introduced by surreptitiously reducing pain stimulus to make volunteers believe an analgesic Rx was effective. This subterfuge yielded real 3 to 5-fold pain reductions that lasted as long as 4 to 7 days later, as assessed by repeat experiments when patients knew they were getting placebo, not drug.In one study ([LINKED_TEXT: 13] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424173/pdf/nihms675070.pdf]), 54 adult female volunteers were told the study compared analgesia from a topical cream compared to placebo. Patients were randomly assigned to long (4 days) or short (1 day) pre-conditioning, i.e., surreptitious Rx with placebo cream. Placebo effect, i.e., perceived analgesia relief, persisted in the long pre-conditioning group even when they were later openly treated with placebo. Implication: Reinforcing treatment cues with positive outcomes can create placebo effects independent of expectations, i.e., placebo effects can also be learned. In a study [LINKED_TEXT: (14] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martina_Amanzio/publication/13417422_Amanzio_M_Benedetti_F_Neuropharmacological_dissection_of_placebo_analgesia_expectation-activated_opioid_systems_versus_conditioning-activated_specific_subsystems_J_Neurosci_19_484-94/links/0912f505b177c89d12000000.pdf]) by Benedetti's group, 229 adult volunteers were subjected to experimental ischemic arm pain (combination of venous blood draw and [LINKED_TEXT: Esmarch bandage] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmarch_bandage]), and conditioned with either opioid morphine or non-opioid [LINKED_TEXT: Ketorolac] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac]. Placebo effect associated with morphine but not by ketorolac could be reversed by [LINKED_TEXT: Naloxone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone].

Implications: Placebo effects associated with different drugs tap different neurochemical pathways. Implications Of Placebo-Associated Learning Effects: Placebos As Drugs Have Potential To Reduce Drug Costs, Dependency, Dose, Side-effects, Tolerance In a pioneering randomized, two group, open-label placebo study ([LINKED_TEXT: 16] [URL: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015591.PDF]) on 80 IBS patients, Kaptchuk et al openly gave sugar pills to one of the groups as 'placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes'. Both groups involved similar patient-provider interactions, the only difference between them being that one got sugar pills.

Though I am also male, I am smart enough to know that the seven-day week has nothing to do with astronomy, bibles, or patriarchal religion, and it has little or nothing to do with the moon. The important universal in human time measurement is the menstrual cycle, which averages 28 days in all known human groups. The only simple factors of 28 are 4 and 7. Thus most human groups have a 4-week month (from both “menses” and “moon”), though some have a 7-week month of 4 days. These are the only systems convenient for midwives, who were the inventors of early math. The 28-day month makes an average human pregnancy 9 months, or 36 weeks, which is correct as measured from time of the last missed period. 36 weeks is also one tenth of 360, the number of degrees in a circle, as probably invented by midwives."},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"I bought my son a phone on my family plan and it gave me a 200 in store gift card that I then used to get myself an Apple Watch."},{"instruction":"What is the future tense of teach?","output":"I teach ( simple present) I taught ( simple past) I will teach ( future)"},{"instruction":"Can you do a singing reveal?","output":"I try"},{"instruction":"Out of the 5 million illegal immigrants pouring over our southern and northern boarders, how many are criminals and terrorists?","output":"Hi Mike Miller, who posed this question, Probably very few. You can look up crime stats on undocumented yourself. Crime stats for the undocumented are lower than for US citizens. That’s because once here an undocumented, the last thing they want to do is to bring attention to themselves which would result in deportation. Mostly they work at low wage jobs, where they can’t complain lest they draw attention to themselves and get deported, and pay taxes because should immigration laws change, they want to show that they’ve been paying their dues, as it were. They don’t vote, again, for fear of drawing attention to themselves. Are there any criminals among the undocumented? Of course, but to repeat, the crime rates among undocumented are lower than among US citizens. You can check FBI crime stats to verify that.

However, it's important to remember that stocks can be volatile and there is always the risk of losing money. Bonds: Bonds are a lower- investment option that can provide a steady stream of income. They are generally considered less risky than stocks, but they also tend to offer lower returns. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are professionally managed investment portfolios that pool money from many investors. They can offer diversification and the potential for higher returns. Real Estate: Investing in real estate can be a great way to generate passive income and build long-term wealth. However, it can also be a complex and risky investment strategy. Retirement Accounts: Investing in retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can help you save for the future while also providing tax benefits. Ultimately, the best investment strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."},{"instruction":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","output":"The way man kind chose to go and live in sealed the deal of the coming of its end, while promising man upon it much suffering, chaos, destruction, pain before it does end."},{"instruction":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","output":"Yeah the hostel fears.

What good is confidence without morality, humility, empathy, ability, determination and other characteristics to compliment it? When one has too much confidence and too high a self-esteem they start to lose the ability to place themselves under the required scrutiny to not only enhance themselves and their abilities, but also the ability to evaluate how they treat others. The Dunning-Kruger Effect is actually strong scientific evidence of my points above concerning some of the negative effects of acquiring too much confidence. Obviously you need some level of confidence or fear will overtake you, but I also feel that fear and other traits have equally important aspects to them concerning our personal welfare and abilities that are much too frequently understated when compared to confidence. Motivation and determination are the most important things a person can possess, not confidence, as confidence is merely a by-product of this. This is why an old wise saying wisely states that the saddest person alive is the person who doesn't know what they want. I have found it sad, and quite frightening actually, that many people admire others not for their abilities, humility, compassion, morality, etc, but merely for their confidence. No wonder we have incompetent people in key positions, and have all of the problems we're experiencing with the world today, and these problems are definitely not due to a world shortage of confident people. I think we're heading down a dangerous path with this extreme emphasis on confidence over other traits, especially without nothing to compliment it."},{"instruction":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","output":"You can plug into iTunes, and if I the device had been previously connected to YOUR iTunes while unlocked, it should show you the name of the iPhone and even the apple ID.

You take your big suitcase to the moving belt and it goes through to another area. You then pick it up and exit customs to deliver it to the location where they take it to load the plane. In the second area where you pick up the bag to exit customs, I was waiting for my suitcase to come out. I kept seeing this other one that looked exactly like mine, except it had a bright lime green ribbon on it. Eventually, the room started clearing more and I started checking all remotely similar bags. That one with the green ribbon was still there but the tag on the bag wasn’t the one I put on mine (besides the green ribbon, which I don’t use). Multiple airline employees were helping me look through luggage, and kept their eye on the one that looked like mine but wasn’t. I eventually had to go exit customs to get to the plane. The green ribbon bag was never picked up while I was there. Mine was missing, so we assumed the other person grabbed mine on accident. They said that because of the bar codes on the their tags, my bag would not get on the wrong plane. The bar code contained the flight information for my destination, among other things. If the luggage handlers were doing their job correctly, they would scan the bag before loading it onto the other persons plane and it would flag an error to let them know it’s the wrong bag/wrong destination. They did end up finding my bag before my flight took off, and nothing was amiss. Now, were someone to grab my bag once we got home, that’s a different story. But at least I’d know they wouldn’t get much because I keep all valuables on me while travelling - never in the checked bag."},{"instruction":"On September 3, 2019, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring that the National Rifle Association (NRA) is a domestic terrorist organization.

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","output":"Growing up in Southern Illinois in the 80′s and 90’s, people talked regularly about sundown towns. Examples would be Anna, Benton and Harrisburg. I went to highschool in West Frankfort, IL and almost never saw black people there. My highschool of 400 kids had zero African Americans, even though there are black people in Southern Illinois in general. As to how dangerous it was to be in these towns at night, I’m not sure. I did have black guests in public there without incident, but I can't say it wasn't a thing to worry about. Actual sundown postings at the edge of towns did not exist in my times. I have heard that a particular blank sign near my house was one and was left up blank as a reminder. I should point out that things have changed dramatically in 30 years. West Frankfort is still racist but I doubt there would be violence. I erased that last sentence a couple of times before deciding to include it, which I suppose says a lot."},{"instruction":"BM just revealed a quantum computer for commercial use at CES 2019, which industries could get the most value from a product like that?","output":"None.

My student's simulator can handle 30 qubits. But IBM’s quantum computer makes errors, and this limits depth. With limited depth, you can simulate a lot more than 30 qubits on a laptop. And even more on a server with decent memory. So, IBM just announced a shiny (literally) toy."},{"instruction":"Who is headless CMS for?","output":"A headless CMS is a powerful and flexible way to manage your content. This makes editing faster and allows you to manage content from multiple channels. This gives developers the flexibility to choose their own front-end tools and makes scaling easier. Additionally, a headless CMS enhances security by separating content from the presentation layer. Headless CMS Benefits: Faster Editing Experience.Manage Content For More Channels.Developer Flexibility.Easier Scaling.Enhanced Security. So Why You Really Need A Headless CMS? Today a headless CMS is the right choice for most growing businesses and many use cases. They have three key competitive advantages over traditional CMS’s. Offering a bespoke editing environment with advanced authoring and publishing workflows. Structured content to enable reuse across multiple platforms like an app, website and print media. And managed infrastructure with scaling and security for peace of mind. However, traditional CMS’s still have their benefits and can fit where someone with a non-technical background needs to launch a website without paying a developer. Think small businesses, local brick-and-mortar stores, and even some basic e-commerce. The plugins and themes offered by a traditional CMS are packed with features and offer tremendous value."},{"instruction":"f I have a solid cat carrying point gene and I'll breed it to a solid one (noncarrier), will kittens still carry the point gene?","output":"This is a question to ask a vet geneticist, as he may be able to answer this."},{"instruction":"What are your arguments for chess to be or not to be considered a sport? And what are your arguments for eSports to be or not be considered a sport?","output":"What are your arguments for chess to be or not to be considered a sport? And what are your arguments for eSports to be or not be considered a sport? First of all, there’s nothing fundamentally at stake in the question. It makes no difference to the universe if we include chess in the list of sports or not. There’s nothing important about carefully distinguishing between sports and non-sports. But there is something at stake in deciding what to do with our time, and where to spend our money. If someone wants to watch physical athleticism on TV, and see the greatest athletes in the world do things we ourselves could never do because we’re on a couch watching TV, then it might make a great deal of difference to us whether chess and other non-athletic activities are included. For example, if “too many” such things are included, we may realize we’re wasting our time watching the event, and we would want to seek out some other event that has more athletic sports and less chess. So to that extent it makes sense to have sporting events that include athletic events and exclude things like chess. I know there’s an argument to be made that chess requires physical fitness and athleticism and so on and so forth. But first of all… that’s false. It’s simply false. You could easily find a chess world champion who had no particular physical fitness and in fact was quadriplegic. But you might counter this by saying that even if fitness isn’t required, it’s still highly recommended. The greatest chess players all seem to agree that peak physical fitness is a requirement for being able to sit all day long in that chair and think hard for 6 hours. And this is true. But in that case, I wouldn’t say that chess should be included as a “sport”, I would say the preparation for chess should be included as a sport. Let’s have Magnus Carlsen and Ding Liren do their daily exercise routine on TV. That would be a sport. Chess would be the non-sport thing they do after doing their sports. So you might counter this by saying, no, chess is the sport, and the exercise is just the training. And I’m fine with that, but in that case we’re still just looking at two people sitting in chairs. I’m doing the exact same thing right there in my home while watching them do it. I’m doing it for exactly the same amount of time they are. And in fact once they finish doing it, I’ll still be doing it because I’ll switch over to netflix. Look at my amazing athleticism! When we can look inside the brain of Magnus Carlsen, and watch his thoughts as he exerts himself in his chosen sport, then I would say yes, we should include chess among other athletic sporting events. But until then, chess may indeed be a sport, but it is a sport we lack the technology to observe. And as long as we lack that technology, chair-sitting will remain a very silly thing to consider a sport. ADDENDUM I love chess. I love all the great masters through history, and I’ve studied the game and appreciate its brilliance and its beauty. I analyze chess games using modern engines, I watch agadmator’s analysis of modern and ancient games. And I invent games that take inspiration from various sources including chess. But come on! The only reason anyone wants to include non-athletic activities in athletic sporting events is because of money and prestige. And money and prestige are simply not the determining factors of whether something is athletic or not."},{"instruction":"Which is the most unbiased news outlet?","output":"Ryan Cristian …the last American vagabond is the most accurate news source I have found to date I’ve fact checked a lot of his work, some may not agree with his opinions but, the news he reports on is solidly fact based."},{"instruction":"Do you prefer Netflix and chill or night out dancing and partying?","output":"Both in all honesty haha.

Does mommy still tie your shoes everyday?"},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"Now that McDonald's does breakfast all day, I'm often in the mood for my favorite sandwich, an egg McMuffin with a sausage patty substituted for the Canadian bacon. The bacon can't be bitten thru by people with unsharpened teeth, so you have to eat the entire slab of bacon in the first bite, because it slides out of the sandwich, or you have to grip the sandwich tightly enough to tear a piece of the bacon off with your teeth. Squeezing the sandwich turns the egg into a crumbled mess. Enough other people feel as I do that my sandwich is on the regular menu, inside and at the drive thru. Instead of calling it Egg McMuffin With Sausage, for some insane reason the menu lists it as Sausage McMuffin With Egg. Here's why I'm putting this in an answer to this question: at McD restaurants all over America, I keep having employees respond to my order as if I had asked for eggs Benedict or a souffle or strawberry crepes. It's as if they've never heard of such a thing. I get their nasty greasy biscuit with their flat square egglike thing and sausage, or an English muffin with just the sausage. Now, if I'm ordering inside, if I see that the counterwight is confused, I point to the lighted menu high on the wall until they see that I'm asking for a thing on their regular menu. Ordering outside, I watch the screen on which they display my order. A few nights ago, on US220 on my way toward Roanoke, at a McD where I've often stopped, I watched the screen list my order correctly, and then CHANGE to some weird biscuit sandwich. At the window, I explained to the kid that on his register screen, there's a button called Sausage McMuffin with Egg, and that's what I ordered, using the name exactly as it’s written on the screen outside. I'm afraid I didn't keep the impatient condescension out of my voice, and he got more and more flustered until he called over the night manager. After I explained it to her twice, she found the secret magical button, pressed it, et voila: my sandwich was ordered. I explained to the kid, as he gave me my change, that he wasn't unusual — I've had McD workers be just as baffled as he was, practically everywhere. This did not make him like me any better, and I drove on to the pickup window, where they served me the correct sandwich. Anyway, my point is that time after time, my order of an item exactly as it is named on their menu has turned out to be a McD employee’s weirdest order ever. I wish that at every McD that offers breakfast all day, they would take employees, one at a time, to a place where they can see the menu, and make them read out loud the words “sausage McMuffin with Egg,” and then explain to the employee that when a customer says those words, then that is the sandwich they should ring up and then make and then serve. Then they should walk them outside to the drive thru menu and repeat the process. Every single employee. Maybe then my order won't sound so shockingly strange to them the next time. And, just to clarify, “completely unfamiliar with the menu” does not imply a substandard intellect. It implies a lack of training. There's nothing wrong with McD servers. It’s management’s fault if employees have never heard of an item that's on the menu."},{"instruction":"Andrew Tate said, the elites want to push women into the job market at any cost, because they want no more families and children, and because women spend more money on trivial things.

It means they either have bad pay-working conditions on offer or it's a company on bad reputation. Now to your question, personally I wouldn't. Thankfully for my level of knowledge of work on CNC machines I'm capable of always having a few options or just going somewhere to be a assistant for something more complex. But if I really, really, really wanted the job and got rejected first time I would look who's in charge of applications. Depending on the company size it could someone in HR, resource manager, general manager, heck it could be even the owner and try to get my resume to them or even talk over the phone or face to face with them. At my current job the owners wife heard what I did and said they needed someone with that skill set, but she couldn't take me in so I should come in on Monday morning and wait for the owner. Monday came, six AM sharp I was there, since I was gonna wait I just decided to work a bit and see how it goes. By 12 I was a bit hungry so I went to eat and the owner just rushed thru(he was in a hurry). So I only got to the interview on Thursday, funny but I'm there for almost eight years now Just try to judge how to approach a situation, like one of the other answers said, doing something multiple times the same way and hoping for a different results is stupidity.

I suppose that’s where the term “rogue planet” comes from. Although, that could just as easily apply to something that was once a planet, and was ejected from its solar system. In order to be defined as a planet, it has to be in orbit around a star. Sort of like, in order to be a “moon”, a body needs to be in orbit around a planet. There are plenty of things in this solar system that are moon-sized, or moon-shaped, that are in fact, not moons, simply because they do not behave as moons behave. In addition, the moons of Mars are almost the same in size and composition as many billions of asteroids.

The best investment strategies depend on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and current economic conditions. Here are some of the best ways to invest money: Diversify your investments: Diversification involves spreading your money across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) and within each asset class. This helps reduce risk because not all investments will perform the same way at the same time.Stock market investments: Investing in individual stocks or through stock index funds can offer long-term growth potential. Stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long run, but they also come with higher volatility.Bonds: Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks and can provide a steady income stream. They are debt securities issued by governments or corporations, and they pay interest over a fixed period.Real estate: Investing in real estate properties or real estate investment trusts (REITs) can provide both income and potential appreciation over time.Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): These are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets.Retirement accounts: Contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can help you benefit from tax savings and grow your investments over time.Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding: These platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or small businesses in exchange for interest payments, providing an alternative investment opportunity.High-yield savings accounts and CDs: While not high-return options, they are low-risk and suitable for emergency funds or short-term goals.Education: Investing in yourself through education and professional development can lead to higher earning potential in the long run.Start a business: Entrepreneurship can be a way to invest money in your own ideas and efforts, potentially leading to significant returns.Consult a financial advisor: If you're unsure about investing or want personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a customized investment plan based on your individual circumstances and goals. Remember, all investments carry some level of risk, and it's essential to align your investments with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations and focus on a long-term investment strategy. Regularly review your investments and adjust your portfolio as needed to stay on track with your objectives."},{"instruction":"My 18yearold son is on the rental lease with me.

If the person continues to pet the other dog, she puts on a terribly hurt expression and slinks away like she’s been scolded. They act exactly like two spoiled children!

It keeps consumers actively engaged in their ecosystems for longer, and increases traditional “eyeball” Monetization.It is a lucrative source for additional data that can be monetized.It is a lucrative source for additional revenues.Lastly, it decreases friction for consumer transactions on the platform. Alibaba and Tencent have pioneered this with Ant Financial/AliPay and WeChat Pay respectively. Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google are working to catch up. All of them are careful about Regulators, and two of them (Facebook and Google) are also battling significant “trust deficits”.

After the war in Kosovo, one of my friends started working as the senior economic advisor for the United Nations administration. His boss was a Russian national from New York. The Russian was a really cool guy and we were soon all friends with him. As it turned out, “our” Russian liked to party a lot. He had rented a nice penthouse apartment in the capital and was organizing at least one party a week. Everyone was invited and he always said: “I don’t care who you are or what you are, come to my place and have fun!” So we went there: my buddy, two or three of his coworkers and me. His apartment was on the roof of one of the few buildings where still some Serbs were living and I remember that more than once, the remaining Serbs had some trouble with the rest of the population. Either their flat was burglarized or someone had burned their car. Of course, there were always a lot of Russians at the parties, not only from the United Nations or other International Organizations but also some guys from the Russian military and Intelligence people. While the military guys were all quite cool and usually drunk after a few rounds of Vodka, (I remember a night when I was drinking with the commander of the Russian KFOR contingent) the Russian spies were rather boring types. Unlike their American, British or French counterparts (those were around, too), the Russian guys never drank and never talked much, at least not with us. I remember especially one of them who was very tall, had a mustache like in some WWI movie. Andrej, so his name, always carried his gun with him in a small black leather bag. I thought that this was rather unprofessional. I never took my gun with me when I went to a party which was probably a good idea. When the parties were over, I used to take some of the Serb guests with me in my car and drove them to their homes in other parts of the city. They were safer with me."},{"instruction":"What are the ways the all you can eat rules are abused at buffets?","output":"Filling your plates sky high then only eating a few bites of it.

(Seen that happen a few times, mainly why I avoid buffets.) People, yes even adults put food on their plates, change their minds and put it back in the dish. Letting the spoon or tongs fall into the dish, touching all the food after many hands have touched it. Imagine how many people wipe their butts and don't bother to wash their hands.

In nearly all cases a look at the evidence quickly disproves what they believe. The conspiracy theorist label has increasingly been used over the years to write off people’s views and there is a danger in that. In September 2002 Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel of the Knight Ridder’s Washington Bureau questioned the rationale behind Bush’s invasion of Iraq. They were labelled as ‘conspiracy theorists’ and yet history has proved them to be correct. The Washington Post even publicly apologised for not properly investigating the claims made by the Bush Administration. The WMDs have never been found and Bush openly jokes about that fact in public events. Don’t forget also that if you suspect a couple of your relatives of organising a surprise party for you then you are, by definition, also a conspiracy theorist I can’t answer the question directly as I don’t personally know anyone who would fit the stereotype of a ‘conspiracy theorist’ but dismissing what someone says just because others have given them a label is just as ignorant as believing anything without first looking at the evidence."},{"instruction":"Why did Instagram launch threads?","output":"There are a few reasons why Instagram launched Threads. To compete with Twitter. Twitter is a popular microblogging platform that allows users to share short messages, or tweets. Threads is similar to Twitter in that it allows users to share short messages with a limited group of followers. This makes it a good platform for users who want to share more personal and private content.To provide a more personal experience. Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos with a wider audience. However, some users may want to share more personal and private content with a smaller group of people. Threads allows users to do this by creating a separate space where they can share content with their close friends and family.To attract new users. Threads is a new app, and it is still under development. However, Instagram hopes that Threads will attract new users who are looking for a more personal and private social media experience. Overall, Instagram launched Threads in order to compete with Twitter, provide a more personal experience, and attract new users. Here are some additional reasons why Instagram launched Threads: To test new features. Threads is a standalone app, which gives Instagram the opportunity to test new features without disrupting the main Instagram app. This could include features such as disappearing messages, end-to-end encryption, and location sharing.To learn more about user behavior. By launching Threads, Instagram can learn more about how users interact with social media. This information can be used to improve the main Instagram app and develop new features.To stay ahead of the competition. Other social media platforms, such as Snapchat and Facebook, are constantly innovating. By launching Threads, Instagram can stay ahead of the competition and offer users a more engaging and personalized experience. Only time will tell whether Threads will be a success.

Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"In France a priest will refuse to celebrate a wedding if you are not legally married first. Being religiously married has absolutely no legal value since 1791. Religiously marrying a couple who is not already legally married might result in as much as 6 months in prison an a 7500 € fine, although this would probably never happen. The only consequence would probably be that the couple would not be legally married. But what might surprise you is that it is the same in many western countries where religious marriage has absolutely no legal value. Others recognize religious as well as civil marriage, such as the UK. In the US, a marriage license must be delivered by a state judicial officer, except in Pennsylvania where this isn’t even needed, meaning you Only need a witness to be legally married."},{"instruction":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","output":"This is the Gilbert Hill and it is one of the greatest geological wonders of India! Formed during the Mesozoic Era about 65 million years ago, it is located bang in the middle of Mumbai. Forget outsiders, even most people of the city do not know of the existence of this 61 metre high hill located in the western suburb of Andheri. Well, many people see it regularly but they do not understand the significance of this piece of lava rock. Geologists would tell you that lava sometimes behave in a funny way. Usually, it erupts and starts creating layers while solidifying. In the case of Gilbert hill, lava erupted with great force and amount and created an enormous block. This is an extremely rare phenomenon and we Mumbaikars are fortunate enough to have this rare natural wonder in our wonderful city. Unfortunately, we have given it complete neglect. Oh, by the way, there was even a builder who wanted to destroy this hill so that he could use the land for his project. By bribing some local politicians and government officials, he even started the process using water jets but was stopped in time by a lobby of geologists who brought government pressure. By the way, the great geologist who studied the ‘different’ behaviour of lava was an American named G K Gilbert. Incidentally, the Hill is named after this American Geologist. By whom and when? No one knows. But it definitely is a worthy name. Most Mumbaikars do not even know that way back in 1952, Gilbert Hill was declared a monument of national importance by the Geological Survey of India to mark its pre-historic importance. On top of the Gilbert hill is a temple of Gaodevi, the guardian deity of the local village. Many local residents say that it is the only thing that is protecting this great geological wonder from complete destruction!

It's known for its soothing and moisturizing properties, and many people use it to address issues like sunburn, dry skin, and minor irritations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind if you're considering applying aloe vera gel on your face overnight: Skin Sensitivity: While aloe vera is well-tolerated by most people, individual reactions can vary. It's a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of your skin before applying it to your entire face. This can help you determine if you have any adverse reactions or allergies to aloe vera.Type of Aloe Vera Product: Make sure you're using a high-quality, pure aloe vera gel or product. Some commercial products might contain additional ingredients that could potentially cause irritation or other issues. Read the ingredient list carefully and opt for products with minimal additives.Occasional Use: Using aloe vera gel on your face overnight occasionally is generally safe for most people. However, using it every night might not be necessary and could potentially lead to over-moisturizing or other skin concerns. Listen to your skin's needs and adjust your usage accordingly.Allergic Reactions: While rare, some people might experience allergic reactions to aloe vera. If you notice redness, itching, or any other adverse effects after applying aloe vera gel, discontinue use immediately.Consult a Professional: If you have any pre-existing skin conditions or concerns, it's a good idea to consult a dermatologist or skincare professional before using aloe vera gel extensively on your face.Staining: Aloe vera gel can sometimes leave a slightly sticky residue on the skin, which could be a minor inconvenience. If you're considering leaving aloe vera gel on your face overnight, here's a recommended approach: Cleanse your face thoroughly before applying the gel.Apply a thin layer of aloe vera gel evenly on your face, avoiding the eye area.Allow the gel to absorb into your skin for a few minutes before heading to bed.If you notice any discomfort or irritation during the night, wash the aloe vera off immediately. Remember that individual reactions can vary, so it's always a good idea to pay attention to how your skin responds and adjust your skincare routine accordingly. If you have any concerns, consulting a dermatologist or skincare professional is the best course of action."},{"instruction":"Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?","output":"That wasn't why Roe v Wade was overturned. The Dobbs decision merely stated that abortion rights did not fall under constitutional purview, and so those decisions would be left up to the individual states. It is however in the Constitution that each and every person has the right to be secure in their persons. And pretty much every state in the Union has laws regarding assault, harassment, and stalking. Just because the Supreme Court made decisions you don't like doesn't give you the right to violate a citizen’s rights… even if they are Supreme Court Justices. Being butthurt doesn't automatically grant you the right to be a jackass, and just because you're offended doesn't automatically mean all actions are justified. The Dobbs decision violated nobody's right to privacy.

I've been driving for over 40 years and have seen how capricious the cops are in enforcing the laws of the road. Traffic laws are really just another way to raise revenue, else they would target those offenses that really put people at risk, and I am not talking about speeders, but those idiots who don't drive with their lights on in the rain, or during the hours of dawn and dusk. Those people who do not observe one way streets just to save having to make a U-turn. The legions of people driving around with defective tail and break lights or headlights. They usually get off with a warning. Do you think a pilot carrying passengers would get off with a warning if he was carrying passengers and took off in an airplane with defective safety systems?

Contact the Person Directly: If you know the mobile number belongs to someone you need to contact, the simplest and most ethical approach is to call or message them directly and ask for their name. 2. Online Phone Directories: Some countries have online phone directories or reverse phone lookup services that provide limited information about phone numbers. You can try searching for the mobile number on these platforms, but keep in mind that mobile numbers are often not publicly listed. 3. Social Media Search: If the person has linked their mobile number to their social media accounts, you might find their name by searching for the number on social media platforms. 4.

This was our first trip to Mumbai, a one day journey through train. We somehow reached Mumbai at 9/9:30 and then we started to explore the much talked about sites, the likes of the Taj hotel, Gateway of India, Fashion street, etc.. We were all tired by the end of the day and it was time to leave. We reached CST and even after continuously searching for the train to Pune we didn't find any, at last we boarded the passenger train to Lonavala. We found empty seats to our amusement, we sat or you could say slept on the the empty seats.. Slowly by each passing station the train was being occupied. We realized that it would be filled in the next 1–2 stations and it did. After almost an hour of travel we reached Kalyan station and we all 6 were sitting besides each other and suddenly a middle-aged man requested one of my friends to vacate the place, we didn't find his request to be a request rather it seemed like an order. The next thing my friend does was really not what we expected as he was a studious and a shy guy by nature and rarely did he reciprocate. Fellow passengers watching this joined in with the man and not did they request but actually ordered to vacate the place, as we all were young and could not understand the situation tried to respond in a similar manner and we backed our friend stating we would not vacate the place as we got the seats first. Quickly the whole compartment turned against us and few started to abuse so we had to take a step back and not only did we have to vacate one place but all the six. We didn't understand what had we done but we saw something unusual as all the people occupying the seats got up and vacated the place for the once standing. Later few stations ahead there was a group of men who explained what had happend to us. He stated that it is an unwritten rule in local trains of Mumbai that once the train completes an hour all those who are siting need to vacate their places for the once who are standing as it is more than 2 hours journey till Lonavala and people work for more than 8 hours a day and travel for more than 4 hours a day.

Although it was never said by Le Corbusier himself, there are some shreds of evidence. Even if he was not, the style he invented was clear totalitarian: cheap and quick to build, with its anti-bourgeois plain facades, well-thought interior designed so people are reduced to their work surroundings. If it’s a living building, it was designed to provide equal access to the sunlight and an equal amount of space for each of its householders. And there is one more obvious reason: nobody maintains those buildings properly, so their facades are blackening and crumbling over time, getting covered with graffiti that creates an atmosphere of urban decay. Together with other modern buildings, these “behemoths” seem to be quite inappropriate. As you correctly pointed out, only architects in the majority can see a particular value in the forsaken piece of concrete that has already become a shelter for wildlife.

National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War Also, I should mention that the negative perceptions around brutalism could be attributed to its word association, which connotes “brutal”, despite being originally a play on french “béton-brut”, meaning “raw concrete”. Among modern architects, though, brutalism has become a subject of renewed interest. It even found its way into interior design."},{"instruction":"Why did the army get rid of digital camo?","output":"I will assume you are referring to the “Universal Camouflage Pattern” (UCP).

Whether it’s using your advanced email marketing skills to cold email, activating your blogging powers, or even podcast like there’s no tomorrow, only you know your strengths and you only have 24 hours in a day, so don’t focus on 10 marketing channels. All you really need is 3 or 4 at most, which should include your strengths.They gain “compound interest” on opportunitiesAn opportunity comes in many different forms and not just from amazing past clients relationships where they will refer your services. From helping out a struggling local business in your community with launching their newsletters for free, sharing your insights on a content marketing topic on social media to a regular user or even meeting a fellow content marketer. Don’t think of these people as “leads” but as a way to connect with another human being. Sometimes, just by them liking you, you’ll possibly land your biggest client (if not by them, then a possible referral) or even your first ever client (which happened to me prior to me launching my growth marketing startup). Also it should just warm the heart to just help someone out sometimes.They give everyone a chanceAnd by everyone, I mean everyone. This should not be confused with setting wrong expectations because that’s entirely different. By everyone I mean people that are the right fit but just can’t afford your service. Just like you, they’re just starting out and trying to build themselves. My friends usually try to help out in other ways if possible, by helping them with the research process and sharing some blog writing articles for them to take it from there, etc. I’m not saying you should work for free because there’s a difference between a client and charity, but have a few times where you just genuinely wanna help in other ways.They find their special sauce and maximize on itThis is the biggest one. Let’s say that you’re very good at podcasting, and you keep people really engaged, then congrats my friend, you found your special sauce. How to maximize it? Using the same service you’re selling -> market that content! Because it’s your special sauce, this growth channel will be the easiest to build and expand and will generally provide one of, if not the highest returns. Think of as many ways as possible to market it, experiment with them by investing either a small amount of time or money, track its performance, then keep the winners as apart of your overall growth channels to focus on. Once done well, you’ll have more clients than you can handle. I have a friend that literally give clients away sometimes haha. CONCLUSION: As long as you put these 4 things into action , set goals and track your efforts on a weekly basis, then trust me, it will pay off very quick, as it did for some of my friends. If you want any more tips, some ideas of content marketing communities to join, or even for me to connect you with some of my friends, then you can reach out to me via my LinkedIn in my profile bio."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"\\"Dinner at 7,honey\\" I read as I walked into our room. It was kept with a red rose. A black tux was smiling at me wishing me for my third wedding anniversary. I looked at my watch. Its 6 now. I better hurry. But where is she? I tried to call her,but its unreachable. Anyway I don't want her to be angry on our day. It took me 20 min or so and I was ready. I walked out of the door and a message popped on my screen. \\"Cassandra Plaza, Park area 3\\" It was the venue. It was a big hotel. \\"She booked a seat there, interesting.\\" Talking to myself. I reached the place. Right on time. It was bright lighting outside the hotel, it was looking different. As I walked in I saw tables arranged in particular circular fashion with a centered space. As I moved on wondering what's happening,I heard, \\"Hey buddy, congratulations on your wedding\\" he was a old school friend. \\"A..a..thanks\\" I couldn't understand. Everyone was looking at me, like I m some sort of movie star. I could recognize some faces, some from school, some from college. But I still couldn't figure out what was happening. Suddenly a music started and everyone moved to sides clearing path for me. Now I could see it, Parth weds Mehak, it was my wedding. I walked toward the stage. Feeling a little embarrassed. I wanted to see her now. There she was, right behind the stage. I looked at her. She smiled and walked up the stage clinging the glass in her hand. \\"Most of you know that we are three year wedded couple, but I m very sorry that we were not able to invite you for our wedding.

We were in a relationship but I didn't wanted him to marry me when I was diagnosed with the disease. And I want to repeat his words, \\"You're not going to die, you're going to be my wife, and I don't let you choose death over me\\" He married me that day in court and spent every penny of his wealth over my treatment and I m here now living again. I..\\" She started sobbing. \\"I want him to be my husband for this and every life ahead\\" I was froze looking at her. She ran toward me in her pearly wedding dress. We both were crying.

I thought leftanarchism viewed liberalism as a tool of capitalism and statism.","output":"The responsibility is calling out the actions. If the violence perpetrated by antifa is to be abhorred then the left wing media needs to point it out. The responsibility of journalists is to report what is happening not to omit what they feel is counter to their agenda. As an example I don’t think I would have been aware of the Berkeley/Yiannopolis riots were it not for the online media. Omission is responsibility. If liberals continue to turn a blind eye then further unchecked violence becomes your responsibility. We all saw this on prime time when the media ran with the premise of weapons of mass destruction. It wasn’t a liberal agenda by any means but a failure of the media itself to discern the truth and thereby causing infinite misery. In the case of antifa liberals are responsible. The conservatives have been pointing out the violence since day one and the liberals have the power ( I think) to stop it."},{"instruction":"What are some of the best blogging tools?","output":"Hi there, There are many free SEO tools available, but the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and goals.

Just kidding! I am surprised at the assumption that ancient Persians were darker. In this picture of the Alexander mosaic, which is supposed to be a realistic representation of events, Darius III looks like he might be my uncle, that is he’s not dark, a bit sunburned maybe. Neither are his soldiers. And looking at Darius the Great I always imagined him as a modern day Persian: dark hair, long straight nose, high cheek bones, well defined eyebrows and large expressive dark eyes. Is it because of these guys here? Sure they look darker but do we even know who they are? Are they Immortals and where were they recruited from?

Plus, they are soldiers which means that they were exposed to the elements a lot. Look at this guy He is a Macedonian soldier (notice the hat and the sarissa, the extra-long spear) probably a veteran from the Persian war. Macedonians weren’t supposed to be dark and yet this guy is definitely not fair. Going to war in Persia is probably to blame. Also, I am pretty sure the Ancient Greeks being all too fond of fancy descriptions (see Ethiopian which literally means burned or “dark as soot”-faced) wouldn’t have left us in the dark (pun intended). I don’t know of any mention of Persians being so dark. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. Finally, I thought the Indo-aryans moved from Persia towards India.

Observation means the quantum particle interacts with a macroscopic system (governed by classical physics), and the process of this interaction alters the quantum state of the particle. This is the resolution to the Schrodinger’s cat paradox as well. As soon as the particle decays radioactively and triggers the Geiger counter, the poison is released and the cat is dead, whether you’ve looked into the box or not. It’s not in a superposition of alive and dead states. It was the interaction of the particle with a classical system that constituted the “measurement” here, not the opening of the box. If some apparatus is used to measure first the position of the particle, this alters its state, drastically increasing the uncertainty in its momentum, so that the outcomes of attempts to subsequently measure the momentum will be different (have a different statistical distribution) than the outcomes of attempts to measure the momentum of the particle first, followed by the position.

He was rude to her.","output":"Personally, I bet 100 if it was any other character in the Marvel Universe that the same people who are complaining about this scene wouldn’t bat an eyelash. WAIT I’ll prove it to you! Are the same people who are calling Captain Marvel a “villain” for squeezing that guy’s hand also calling Captain America a villain for throwing a normal police officer (who was just doing his job) out of his car?!? And then stealing said car. Oop, I heard crickets on that one, JARVIS. Or when Bucky Barnes threw a guy off a moving motorcycle and proceeded to steal it. Still nothing, JARVIS?! But wait Captain Marvel’s scene was a freaking deleted scene unlike these other very much canon scenes. Captain Marvel’s mild defense against a guy who was harassing her is not canon. So, don’t complain about her and express your grievances over these other poor guys who actually got hurt by our heroes. BESIDES, do you think that any other hero, including Captain America wouldn’t have done the same in that situation. But I bet if it was Captain America defending Captain Marvel then nobody would care right? Because they rather see her as the damsel in distress and THATS THE TEA.

These rating agencies such as CRISIL have their rating systems which are very obsolete. For example, many 5 star rated funds have an AUM of less than even 100 cr. They should have atleast a criteria of minimum AUM and other such criteria for proper ratings. Thus one should not blindly trust the ratings as they change their colour more often than a chameleon. I remember investing in L&T Emerging business fund in 2017 and it was rated 5 star back then and now in 2021 it's rated only 2 star. If by seeing the rating change I would have redeemed my money I would have lost around 20% of my investment. Thus only was to select good funds is by looking at management of AMCs and fund manager's performance. I personally like SBI MF most and then ICICI and HDFC.

Hugs are one of the most important communication of caring, comfort, and protection. So it would make sense that this is something you would want and imagine. Most therapists don’t hug their clients as a professional boundary, I am one who does hug. If your therapist has a professional boundary they practice then you will have to accept the imagination as enough. It may be comforting to think of when distressed. You can also ask your therapist if a hug would be okay. Hope this helps and that you will accept your therapist as in the non-hugging camp if s/he is.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection found almost in one-third population of Africa and South America. For Schistosomiasis or any other parasite infestations eosinophils are very important as they attach themselves to the baby parasites or schistosomiasis and they kill many of them.

If you believe that one is real, it pretty much follows that the rest are real too and vice versa.

It may be tempting to simply go with whichever material looks the nicest, but it’s important to know about the differences between granite and marble if you want your countertops to stand the test of time and give you maximum value for your money. Here’s a closer look at the main ways that granite and marble differ from one another. 📲 Call For Marble & Granite Inquire Now:- 91-9001156068 Granite vs. Marble—what's the difference? Granite has more defined lines, a coarse grain, and feels slightly harder. It’s also slightly lighter in color than marble. Marble is softer than granite, with an even texture that can sometimes appear veined. It’s a little darker in color, usually ranging from greyish-pink to white or black. These are all very general descriptions; how they look really depends on their variety (such as mottled or striped). But if you see two slabs side by side that are otherwise similar to the same color and pattern, say the one made of granite will be chunkier looking while marble will be smoother. So if appearances matter to you, be sure to ask questions so you know what you’re getting! Understanding Granite Varieties Granite has a more consistent color than marble, which makes it a better choice if you’re looking for something to match a particular scheme or interior design. Granite is more resistant to staining than marble, so it’s ideal for homes with kids or pets. But don’t worry granite stains can be cleaned up easily with some rubbing alcohol and elbow grease. 📲 Call For Marble & Granite Inquire Now:- 91-9001156068 Understanding Marble Varieties Marble isn’t just one thing. In fact, there are several varieties of natural and man-made marbles to choose from. Some have a polished or glossy finish; others have a matte or stone-like appearance. To make it even more confusing, these terms are often used interchangeably. Many people don’t know that there is actually a difference between different types of marble. Where to Use Each Type of Stone When it comes to countertops, there are a few different options to choose from. Granite and marble are perhaps two of the most popular choices, with each having its own pros and cons. You’ll have to weigh these against your own design preferences before making a decision. Granite is much more durable than marble but not as sturdy as natural stone. This means that it will be resistant to scratches, but can crack if you drop something heavy on it. 📲 Call For Marble & Granite Inquire Now:- 91-9001156068 Cost Considerations On average, you will spend more money on a traditional marble countertop compared to natural stone countertops. Granite countertops cost about 4-7 per square foot, but they can be much higher for certain finishes, such as polished or high-gloss. On the other hand, you’ll pay 10-13 per square foot for a solid surface or engineered quartz countertop. Maintenance Considerations Granite countertops require less maintenance than a lot of other kitchen surfaces since they are resistant to most chemicals. The surface will not warp or chip if it comes into contact with acids such as vinegar or lemon juice, however, you should be careful when using any type of oil-based lubricant on your counters. When washing your granite countertops, you can use mild dish soap, hot water, and a sponge without fear of damaging them. 📲 Call For Marble & Granite Inquire Now:- 91-9001156068 Final Thoughts on Granite Versus Marble When you’re out shopping for materials for your kitchen or bathroom, you’ll no doubt come across both granite and marble. Both materials are extremely durable, although marble can be more sensitive to everyday wear-and-tear. Granite tends to be more scratch-resistant than marble; however, if your countertop takes a lot of abuse, in other words, it becomes a kitchen workhorse the dark flecks of color in both stones will start to show through. 📲 Call For Marble & Granite Inquire Now:- 91-9001156068 Also, [LINKED_TEXT: Watch Your YouTube Videos] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/c/BhutraMarbleGranites] (Our Top YouTube Channel is Granite & Marble Knowledge In India With 80k Subscribers)"},{"instruction":"What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection?","output":"Plz go through the book, The unparalleled parallels, Author pramila Iyer."},{"instruction":"What is the slickest way a person has gotten out of a traffic ticket?","output":"The best way to get out of a ticket is to be connected, white, female, reasonably attractive, cooperative, polite, respectful, and well-dressed.

But when something bad happens, many people will immediately feel that they are also a victim, so as to avoid responsibility, learning to be responsible is life an important subject. The results of many things are often caused by your actions. When you fail or screw up a thing, instead of feeling sorry for yourself and shirk responsibility, it is better to learn from it so that you can do better next time. 02 Critical thinking In the Internet age, we are exposed to hundreds of times information every day, so how to evaluate this information becomes critical. We need good critical thinking to sift through trivial information. Potentially valuable information and connecting it to other information, with good critical thinking, can make you stand out from the crowd quickly. 03 Effective decision Effective decision-making is the bridge from analysis to action, judging what to do based on the information available. Lack of critical thinking in decision-making is very dangerous, as is over-analytical or indecision in decision-making. Responding quickly and effectively and taking action right away is the key to effective decision-making and the biggest difference between a doer and a dreamer. 04 Search survey No one knows everything about life, and in this era, you don't have to know everything, but when you encounter problems, you can quickly understand what you need to know.

Lets get into it. Hidan He is not Kage level.Yes he took down the two tails but we don’t know what actually happened in that fight and did Kakuzu help him or not.He can also easily be beaten with prep time and relies on one technique that can easily be countered. So he is Jonin to elite jonin but not higher. Kakuzu He is Kage level no doubt about it.He has the ability to take down bijuu.He can make his body hard as a diamond giving him super strength and durability.He has large scale wind, fire and lightning jutsu.He has those threads with which he can bind people and steal their hearts or finish them.He has the necessary abilities to take down a bijuu.His hearts can fight independently as a team with him so he can be a one man team in taking down a tailed beast. Deidara He definitely can take down a bijuu especially since he can cause village busting explosions with his c3.He also has that c4 karura.He even took down the three tails however I don’t know whether Obito had a part in that or not. So yeah he is.Also he does have a weakness against lightning but even with that weakness it was pretty hard for Sasuke to beat him which shows he isn’t weak. Sasori This guy also definitely is. He has a pretty dangerous poison that should work on tailed beasts since they do have proper body parts as when it was said ginkaku and kinkaku ate inside the nine tails stomach so he had to spit them out.He has the third kazekage puppet which has iron sand something that is considered very dangerous and is stronger than shukaku sand already putting him above shukaku.He can summon 100 puppets which makes him a one army so he could take down a bijuu by cutting each and every part of it and paper bombs, poison etc.He is Kage level without a doubt.Also even with an antidote to his poison and his grandmother being more experienced than him, knowing all his weaknesses and having access to the 10 strongest puppets in history, still couldn’t beat him and he let them kill him. Konan Now its hard to say whether she is Jonin or Kage level.She is too vulnerable to acid, oil type based attacks.I mean she was beaten and useless in the first seconds with Jiraiya.But she can summon a huge number of paper bombs that should be able to take down bijuu.Yes I know that was prep time but those were 600 billion paper bombs whereas in a fight she should easily summon atleast 1000 paper bombs which can cause pretty large explosion like that of deidara. Also she can make her paper as strong as steel so she can sever parts of tailed beasts. I think she should be Kage level as she is no Hidan. Kisame Might I even explain?This guy is basically a kryptonite to Tailed beasts as at the end of the fight he might be stronger than them by leeching on their chakra.He is also no one trick pony and cannot be beaten by prep time.He is Kage level. Orochimaru No doubt about it he is Kage level.He has one of the most powerful summonings as in Manda and we saw Gamabunta fighting Shukaku pretty good while Manda is much stronger than Gamabunta.He also has the 8 branches technique in which he is far larger and much stronger than Manda.Itachi had totsuka blade and Yata mirror both most hax weapons in history so no wonder he lost. Itachi Yup him too.He has the Mangekyou with which which he can put any tailed beast under his control even the nine tails so that means he already qualifies.He has Amaterasu that can take them down as well if you remember how Sasuke took down the 8 tails with and he escaped through a substitution.He doesn’t need susanoo for any tailed beast. Pain Again do I need to explain?He was in his weakened state able make three of Naruto summonings fly.He can absorb a tailed beast power making him useless just like Kisame and unlike Kisame he doesn’t have a limit as to how much he can absorb at a time.He has summonings.He has gedo mazo.He has chibaku tensei.He has his black receivers that can take over a summoning the way Obito did.He is Kage level without a doubt. Obito All I have to say is Kamui.He can kamui a tailed beast and finish him.He has mangekyou with which just like Itachi can take over any tailed beast as he as a 14 year old took over the nine tails. No doubt he is Kage level.

What do you make of this statement?","output":"There has been a lot of criticism of Richard Grant White in the answers, and in a way that’s correct. Most people would say “Who is Richard Grant White” or “Richard Grant White is talking through his hat” or something similar. Well, if anybody does a quick search he/she will see that Richard Grant White was a leading figure in the 19th century, and of course Linguistics has changed beyond recognition since then. It’s probably not even worth wasting one’s time to try to find out what he meant by “grammar”, but it certainly is nothing like what we mean by the term today. So any criticism of him is probably not really justified."},{"instruction":"Trump ordered the airstrike at BIAP to kill Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general. What do you think of this action?

Dormammu has absorbed entire dimensions into his own dark dimension, This makes him at minimum universal. He’s been stated to be an 11th dimensional being, This makes Dormammu High Complex Multiversal, The MCU also exists on a string theory, Which is also 11th dimensional, [LINKED_TEXT: 11th dimension - WikipediaThis disambiguation page lists articles associated with the title 11th dimension .

Dormammu is also stated to have infinite power, Although I highly doubt this since Strange was able to trap Dormammu with the time stone and Dormammu wasn’t powerful enough to break out of it, before anyone says Dormammu was powerful enough to break out of it but he didn’t because he didn’t know what time is… just don’t because Strange literally tells Dormammu what is happening, Or if you just want to role with Dormammu having infinite power then that still wouldn’t matter since the three infinity stones (power stone, mind stone, reality stone and soul stone) have been stated to have infinite power, And he’s even been straight up confirmed to be below the infinity stones (although I don’t know if this is even official but even if it isn’t Ultron having three infinite power sources > Dormammu only having one infinite power source), And even just by punching Ultron was changing all of reality, And was turning the multiverse into “a messy soup”, And the multiverse is infinite, And again this was just by punching. Conclusion: Infinity Ultron has better feats and statements and the fact that Dormammu has been confirmed to be below the Infinity stones just adds to the fact that Infinity Ultron is winning this fight. The Winner Is… Infinity Ultron: Med - High Diff.

Lily thinks of it the right way, “Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not the person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love.” Lily, the protagonist of Colleen Hoover’s It Ends With Us. Ryle loved Lily. It showed in his altering his major life rules for her, rejecting his highest career goal and supporting hers instead— all, however, did get squandered because his aggression dominated his affection, at times. Repeating his violent actions, Ryle was apologetic— a common reason why people do not leave. They apologize, and are granted chance upon chance, hoping for a change. He was genuinely sorry for having mistreated her. He never wanted to be the reason for her affliction. He never wanted to lose her. He had promised to never repeat it the first time he ‘accidentally’ hit her. Ryle loved Lily. But love doesn't allow violence, with no excuse whatever. Ryle knew he was problematic. It ached him knowing he caused her aches (I almost rooted for him, ngl). He lived through his childhood trauma, and thus, struggled with PTSD. But your sufferings, in no way, excuse you to make others suffer. Lily, at last, sought refuge in Atlas, her first love. The perfect guy, who isn't commonly found outside these tales. Another reason why people don't leave. There isn't everyone's true love waiting for them. They compromise, constantly hoping that their love will paint all red flags, green. I doubt if Lily would've been bold enough to ask Ryle for divorce if Atlas hadn't returned to her life. And the last reason— their child. Children are usually the reason why parents don't separate, no matter how toxic one of them turns out. They think it to be the best to let their child live with both parents together. But since Lily was such a child, she didn't want her daughter to do the same— view her father through a negative lens. She knew that the moments of her father being cruel are bound to leave an impact on her mind. She saved Ryle from being a villain in his daughter's eyes. They shared the custody of their child, but not their lives. There exist very many reasons to stay, but if physical or mental stability is threatened, it isn't worth taking the risk. It's worth rather taking excruciating pain to end it at the moment. “Cycles continue because they are excruciating to break.” ~Colleen Hoover, It Ends With Us."},{"instruction":"w did you end up in the San Francisco Bay Area? What's your story?","output":"Mine is pretty straight forward. I went to grad school at UC Berkeley. I didn’t actually have a very clear picture of what the Bay Area was when I applied in late 1997. I knew UC Berkeley, but not really. The hippy movement and free speech movements were vague impressions in my mind. This history is basically relegated to history books, but in 1997, it still was visible with many 20–30 year residents recalling the halcyon days from decades ago. I wouldn’t say that I loved the Bay Area on my first impression when I visited March 1998 — it was a pretty severe El Nino. My visit went pretty badly and I was pretty unimpressed. But I objectively looked at my other options and Berkeley had the best options for me and I jumped in and gave it a try. I grew to love the area and now have lived here longer than I’ve lived anywhere. My wife is from here and my daughter was born here.

Lady Godiva (Old English Godgifu) was an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon nobleman and wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. She was, by all accounts, a kind and generous soul and made many large donations to the church. But Godiva is best remembered for starring in a controversial 13th-century tale that said he was run naked through the streets of the city of Coventry. No matter what version of the story we're dealing with, it's still great. I mean, what more could any red-blooded American libertarian male in British myth want? Some jerks Tyrant's hot wife dares, takes off her birthday suit, and rides naked on city streets, on horseback, to let her long hair down so people stop paying so much tax. One can't help but feel sympathy for the big-hearted and bubbly heroine of the story. Not only is it an enjoyable and rather fantastic story, it's also a bit more plausible than many other myths and legends—and much thought it might.

Wind turbines generate electricity through the movement of wind, which turns the blades of the turbine. This rotation is then transferred to a generator that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. Wind turbines do not require any fuel, such as diesel, to operate, making them a clean and renewable energy source. Some wind turbines may have backup diesel generators for emergency power supply, but this is not typical and does not form a part of the normal operation of the wind turbine. Wind energy is a growing industry and is seen as a key part of the transition towards a low-carbon energy system. Wind turbines can be installed both onshore and offshore, with offshore wind being particularly attractive due to the higher wind speeds and consistent wind patterns found at sea. Wind energy is considered a cost-competitive form of renewable energy, with the cost of wind energy continuing to decrease as technology improves and economies of scale are achieved. In addition to being a clean energy source, wind energy can also provide other benefits such as reduced dependence on fossil fuels, local economic development, and improved energy security. With continued technological advancements and supportive government policies, the wind energy sector is expected to continue to grow in the coming years."},{"instruction":"Should Confederate statues and monuments remain in order to remind us of the dark past and to remind young generations how dangerous division is?","output":"Confederate statues and monuments should remain to remind us of the dark past when our own government, went to war on peaceful citizens who simply wanted to govern themselves.

You move the lever, the gears shift smoothly by one sprocket. There is no “guess a distance to move the shift lever then trim the lever to reduce drivetrain grinding/clicking”. Indexed shifting has also given rise to STI integrated brake / gear shift levers on road bikes, and Rapid Fire shift levers on mountain bikes, which aren’t really possible with friction shifters. The only real advantages of friction shifters are Able to shift many gears fast if you hit a steep hill. Not really a problem as people can shift “fast enough” with indexed shifters, especially if you look ahead at the terrain. Some indexed shifters are able to shift multiple gears at a time, and electronic DI2 shifters can be set to shift continuously as long as you hold the lever down.No requirement to tune-up shifters when indexing drifts out of alignment. Quality shifters don’t need tuning often, and bike shops are more than happy to sell you indexed shifters then make money off regular servicing.Lower purchase cost.

From where I lived, Australia was only reachable in the morning. Use online Dx spotting sites to find out who is on the air. The best thing is to google ham contests and get on the air on those days.

Ultimately I bought a spectrum analyzer that swept the band I was interested in, most 20 meters, and wherever it showed a blip it was either a station broadcasting or just static. The best skill you can have is in learning how to find hams on the air. You can park on a frequency and call out CQ. but I rarely did that. Even if you have to turn your frequency knob slowly, sweep the bands to see if you hear anyone.

Agarwal is known for his philanthropy deeds and is most enthusiastic about social and rural development of India. He has donated around Rs 1,796 crore in the past year. Wow!

Is it a trait that somehow selected for during domestication?","output":"A dog pants to reduce body temperature. Just as a human sweats for the same purpose. Releasing fluids, those fluids evaporating, reduce a rising internal temperature. The obesity is an issue because the extra weight causes the body temperature to rise quicker than if the dog were a healthy weight. Feral animals will be the correct weight and would need to expend more energy to raise their temperature. They also live outdoors which helps to prevent a rise in temp even when they are active. This being said wolves do still many just as a domestic dog. I imagine you haven’t had all that much time with a wolf during their day to day adventures to determine they rarely pant. Educational videos do exist that show wolves panting. Anxiety is another cause for panting but only because the anxiety causes a rise in body temperature as well."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"When it comes to choosing the best car under 10 lakhs in India, there are several fantastic options available that offer a blend of affordability, features, and performance.

It will be difficult for others to even name so many places in any other southern state. If Kannadigas are least known then I would say Tamilians are the most notorious and considered as someone representing the whole of South India. This is not to say that tamilians are rude but definitely perceived or stereotyped to be. Even here in Quora you can meet many of them and experience what I said. As far as Kannadigas are concerned, they do not appear to come Up to your face primarily due to their calm and simple demeanor. Rahul Dravid is a prime example.

Period. Their only fiscal tool is to cut taxes, that has left them with a very small toolbox. Now they do blame others, but that is not a tool, it is an excuse for their failure to do the impossible. Their last tax cut has resulted in greater deficits, no surprise there. They arbitrarily increase the defense budget. They attack programs for the poor, the needy, the powerless. The cuts don’t begin to cover their budget increases. When in power they are absolutely shameless, the gifts to the wealthy are without merit, yet there is no shame and no political cost. In their pursuit of a government “small enough to drown in a bathtub”, they are unconcerned of the consequence of their actions regarding the financial health of the nation. I am not aware of any instance when they have had power that they have in good faith sought to balance the budget. Their balanced budget arguments are only made when they are in a minority position. It is used as an attack on the Democratic majority. It is used to message to their voters.

The scientific world is highly competetive, however when Covid hit, this was lessened as it was simply bigger than getting bragging rights for a discovery. In the european union, widespread cooperation between agencies and nations was seen. Usually, ones discoveries are held tight to ones chest as to not reveal an inch to competitors and other scientist before a paper can be published and credit be acclaimed.

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

Minecraft, has indeed been written in Java, a language that is often criticized for not being optimized for high-performance 3D games. So why did Mojang Studios choose to use Java for Minecraft instead of recreating it in C++, which is often considered a more suitable language for 3D games? The decision to use Java for Minecraft was primarily driven by historical reasons. When Markus Persson, also known as \\"Notch,\\" first started developing Minecraft, he chose Java because it was a language he was familiar with and it provided cross-platform compatibility, allowing the game to be played on various operating systems. At the time, Minecraft was a small indie project, and the performance limitations of Java were not a significant concern. As Minecraft gained popularity and Mojang Studios grew as a company, rewriting the entire game from scratch in C++ would have been a massive undertaking. It would have required significant resources, including time, money, and expertise, to recreate the game in a different language while ensuring that it retained its core gameplay and features. Additionally, Mojang Studios would have needed to redevelop and optimize the game for multiple platforms, which would have been a daunting task. Moreover, despite its performance limitations, Java has several advantages that made it a viable choice for Minecraft. Java provides a high level of abstraction, which makes it relatively easy to develop and maintain complex codebases. It also has a large community of developers, a wealth of libraries and tools, and a robust ecosystem of plugins and mods that have contributed to Minecraft's modding community, allowing players to customize and extend the game to their liking. Another important factor to consider is that Minecraft's gameplay is not as reliant on cutting-edge graphics and realistic physics as some other modern 3D games. Minecraft's block-based world and simple graphics style do not require the same level of computational power as more graphically intensive games. This means that despite Java's performance limitations, it can still deliver a satisfactory gaming experience for Minecraft players. Furthermore, transitioning from one programming language to another involves risks and challenges, including potential bugs, loss of existing features, and changes in gameplay mechanics. Such a transition would also require players to update their game clients, and it could potentially alienate some of the existing player base."},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

Let me cite it with a true example. My father is a shop owner in india(tier 3 city) and whenever I visit my town,I sit with him for 3 hours daily just to help him with his work. Ours is a wholesale shop and there is lot of scope for bargaining and we decide the price according to personality ,body language, and style of talking and our relations with our customer.Suppose a candle is priced 20 1. A customer comes to buy 12 candles.I will see the way he talks,and how confidently he talks. If he is a regular customer of ours he will talk in a very confident way bcoz he knows the price which I will charge him that is 16 for one candle. So 16 × 12 = 192 for 12 candlesHe seems to be normal and has no anxiety on his face and body language seems to be alright so I judge him believing that he is our regular customer and he knows the price so I cannot charge him anything more than 16.So I charge him 16. (I visit my hometown only twice a year so I dont know who really our customers are,I have no other option rather than judging them based on their body language and confidence) 2. Comes a 2nd manHe asks for the price of 12 candles..I say him 18. He then bargains, to which I very politley deny selling beyond 17.5Looking at his personality and confidence in his voice, I judge him that at what price I can settle the deal and accordingly I settle it.Since I found this man grtting confused in his own tone.Rythm of tone varying and is not firm at his price, it seems he just wants to bargain and that too he doesnot appear to be good in bargaining. I quote my final price of 18 an he has nothing but to accept my quote.And ends up paying. All the prices that I offer are based on the person's confidence and body language.Sometimes I have to sell lesser than my least price 16.5 because the customer talks me in such a way ,denting me impressed and confused. Self confidence helps you a lot for your business to grow and will give you some added benefits which others dont seem to enjoy. If you have nothing but confidence on self, you can do anything.People judge you by your self confidence. The world is stereotypical and judgemental. The first and the foremost thing people will judge you will be based on your body language. Your body language is representation of your confidence. Your walking style,position of head, placement of shoulders,eye contact, feet movement. All represent your confidence. Self confidence results in positive body language and positive body language results in greater self confidence. **FAKE IT TILL YOU BECOME IT**- amy cuddy Check out TED TALK OF AMY CUDDY Self confidence will help you in every aspect of your life.Be it cracking deals, proposing your dream girl, talking a stranger, landing a job or whatever be it.

Should I learn servlet, JSP, any framework, or any other language? And what should be the sequence of language?","output":"Thanks for A2A Hey, nice knowing that you want to learn some new things. That is the beauty of computer programming, you can learn anything, all you need is right with you, your computer, dedication and a couple of good courses if you may. Since you mentioned that you have already learnt Java, JSP and Servlet I would assume that you would like to go forward in the direction of web development. If you want to learn enterprise software then I would suggest Spring Framework, and other helper projects like Hibernate, etc. I would suggest you to try Spring WebFlux which uses reactor library to make non blocking servers. Learn this one and if possible try to learn Spring Cloud Distributed systems are what will drive us to future and Spring Cloud helps you in that. If you want to try something new, I would strongly recommend MEAN or MERN stack. It is crazy good. I would also suggest looking into DJANGO which uses python, so learning that would make you well versed in that language. Another one that I have in my mind and I myself am planning to learn is Web Go which uses GoLang as it’s primary language. Go is super sick man, it’s goroutines are love. Now that was for web development from my side, why not go ahead and learn some new tech itself. Try things like Big Data, ML, Deep Learning, NLP, etc. In the end I would suggest to not worry about anything, you have all you need just practice and you will be good at anything you want. Try out new things, they won’t take much time to learn and while doing so you may come to know about something you love and focus on that moving forward.

I’ll stick with INFJs, simply because I understand them best, for my example. INFJs usually long to make a difference in the world, to help people. That is the what. The Enneagram covers the how. As a type 8, my passion is in defending and leading. Type 8 INFJs are determined to be some kind of motivational leader who fights to end injustice, because that is how type 8s respond to a challenge.

This way, the constant ringing of the clock will force you to wake up and get to your business without having to snooze. Second tip is to brush with your non dominant hand while bodily awake but with sleepy eyes. Brushing with your dominant or your primary hand daily will wire your brain to record it as a habit. Hence, your brain will subconsciously continue the act of brushing while you may still be in the drowsy mode. So try using your non dominant hand, i.e if you are right-handed then use your left hand and vice versa as your brain will sense a deviation in the usual activity resulting in your body mood shift. Make sure to occasionally switch sides when the method fails to wake you. Third tip is to allow light in the room. Be it sunlight or light in another form, try to allow some form of it into the room, preferably near your face. This will aide in waking you up.

Here are some general tips to help you manage your blood sugar levels: 1. **Healthy Diet:** Pay close attention to your diet. Choose foods that have a low glycemic index (GI), as they cause slower and more gradual increases in blood sugar. These include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. Limit your intake of refined carbohydrates, sugary foods, and drinks, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar. 2. **Portion Control:** Watch your portion sizes to avoid consuming too many carbohydrates at once, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. 3. **Regular Meals and Snacks:** Aim for regular, balanced meals throughout the day to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Avoid skipping meals, as this can cause fluctuations in blood sugar. 4. **Limit Sugary Drinks:** Avoid sugary sodas, fruit juices, and other sweetened beverages. Instead, choose water, herbal teas, or sugar-free alternatives. 5. **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve insulin sensitivity, which allows your body to use blood sugar more effectively. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, along with strength training exercises on two or more days per week. 6. **Weight Management:** If you're overweight or obese, losing weight can significantly improve blood sugar control. It can also reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 7. **Medication and Insulin:** If you have diabetes and are prescribed medication or insulin, take them as directed by your healthcare provider. Be mindful of the timing and dosages to manage your blood sugar effectively. 8. **Monitor Blood Sugar:** Regularly check your blood sugar levels as advised by your healthcare provider. This can help you understand how your diet, exercise, and medications affect your blood sugar and make necessary adjustments. 9. **Stress Management:** High levels of stress can affect blood sugar levels. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or any activity that helps you manage stress. 10. **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Lack of sleep can impact blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. 11. **Work with Healthcare Professionals:** Regularly visit your healthcare team, including your doctor, diabetes educator, and dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance and support in managing your blood sugar. Remember, individual responses to these strategies can vary, so it's essential to work with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan that suits your specific needs and medical condition. If you have diabetes, always follow your doctor's advice and attend regular check-ups to monitor your blood sugar control effectively."},{"instruction":"f Thatcher is so hated, why did Sky News Australia say Britain became great under her and said they liked her?","output":"Rupert Murdoch is a known right wing nut.

Without the monetary infusion coming from sales, capital will run dry and any hopes for improvement or expansion is nil at best. Several levels within the company will be affected such as the cost of operation and maintenance, employee salary, etc if there is no money available. Closing as many deals as possible should be one of the foremost priorities of every business that is hoping to thrive and succeed in their chosen niche. The significant amount of sales helps you regain your capital and pave the way for expansion and increase of operation. A webinar I have come across recently talks about how you can take advantage of three powerful tools and revolutionize your sales process to close more deals. Here are the following [LINKED_TEXT: tools] [URL: https://www.outsourceaccelerator.com/articles/10-best-free-bpm-software-tools/] mentioned: Process Street - is an API that can turn your daily processes into executable workflows. These tools can house all of your processes and procedures and hook them into any of your other tools via automation.Panda Doc - is a sales operation tracking tool that will help you monitor all the documents you send out to your clients such as proposals and contracts to streamline your sales team's activities and help them focus more on closing deals.Groove - a sales engagement platform that will help you manage your inbound and outbound sales process to be on top of them and manage your clients better. This is the sales platform used by giants such as Google, Slack, Asana, and Uber that helped them grow their sales pipeline efficiently.SaneBox - keeps your email inbox orderly by committing your behavioral pattern and determine which emails you consider important and which are not. This way, you do not have to scroll down your long list of emails to make sure you did not miss any or jumping from folder to folder in the fear that one of them might have gotten lost. Sanebox separates unimportant emails into another folder and makes sure that it keeps the ones you need right in your primary inbox. This helps you save minutes, even hours, from just sorting your messages.StayFocused - along with all the advantages the internet has afforded us when it comes to making our jobs easier, it has also opened doors for distractions and time-wasting. StayFocused helps drive your productivity even higher by blocking distracting websites during working hours helping you work more by focusing more, rather than having divided attention between work and social media.Dlvr[.]it - helps your productivity by allowing you to post on different websites without going through the trouble of logging in individually on every site.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"I don’t know if it is a war crime, but the use of the white flag or signalling your intention to surrender then taking up arms again is a violation of the Geneva Convention and is considered a criminal offence. As is the violation of the Red Cross. Examples of this actually happening occurred in the Falklands campaign. At Goose Green, some Argentine soldiers indicated their willingness to surrender, when some Para’s went forward, they were then fired on by a supporting trench who clearly saw what the other trench was doing. The trench indicating their desire to surrender then took up their arms again. The Para’s would have been within their rights after that point to ignore any attempts to surrender by the Argentine Forces. An Argentine gun crew opened fire and murdered two Army Helicopter pilots whose aircraft had been shot down. Once the helicopter crew were out of the helicopter, they inflated their life vests. Aircrew life vests are brightly coloured (usually a colour known as “International Orange” IIRC). This indicates that the aircrew are no longer to be considered as combatants. The Argentine gun group opened fired and murdered those defenceless aircrew. The ARA Bahía Paraíso - a hospital ship and displaying the Red Cross - abused the Red Cross symbol. While in port in Argentina it was filled with munitions and soldiers, all hidden by boxes of medical supplies. When Red Cross officials tried to inspect the cargo, they were told that it was too urgently needed for the Argentine wounded. The Red Cross official then let the ship sail. By carrying arms, ammunition and combatant soldiers, this was a violation of the Red Cross symbol."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Thanks for the A2A Sir! Well , here is a short story : There was a business executive who was deep in debt and could see no way out.Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy.Suddenly an old man appeared before him. “I can see that something is troubling you,” he said.After listening to the executive’s woes, the old man said, “I believe I can help you.”He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying, “Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.”Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.The business executive saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!“I can erase my money worries in an instant!” he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought.With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.“I’m so glad I caught him!” she cried. “I hope he hasn’t been bothering you. He’s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he’s John D. Rockefeller.”And she led the old man away by the arm.The astonished executive just stood there, stunned. All year long he’d been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, convinced he had half a million dollars behind him.Suddenly, he realized that it wasn’t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he went after."},{"instruction":"w does the Canadian healthcare system prevent people from going to the doctor excessively when they aren't sick, with no copays and deductibles?","output":"Why would someone who isn't sick go to the doctor?

The Tragedy of the Commons doesn't apply to everything."},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"If a male employee were to tell me that he refuses to meet individually or attend a business lunch with a female simply because he's married, I’d just say that's a load of bull. If in the other hand any male raises the very same concern due to fears of unfounded sexual harassment claims, I'd say they're completely justified. In this #metoo age, all men working with women are simply walking court-cases waiting to happen. All a woman need do is to raise a complaint against a fellow colleague for the most ridiculous reason and HR will fall for it hook, line and sinker. Of course many will say that if you don't do anything wrong, you have nothing to fear. However unfortunate experience has taught me that women will treasure their reputation and moral standing more than your career or more than your very life. If that extra flirt over that drink or that little episode in that business trip with you years ago ever makes it to the office gossip channels, you're done for. She can't of course admit to anything thrashy, so obviously it was all you. She never invited you back to her room, you had of course forced your way in there. For God's sake, she didn't even want to come on the trip all alone with you in the first place. She just went along with it because she was afraid it would have impacted her upcoming promotion and of course she never said anything all these years because she was intimidated. At the end it's just your word against hers and we all know how that will go. Bang, there goes your career and the wife you met and married a couple of years after the incident walks out on you and files for divorce. So yes, I can very well understand a man hesitant to place himself right in the line of fire and as a boss you should actuality anticipate such problems yourself and try not to place your employees in such potentially difficult situations. That said I did start this with if the guy says he wouldn't do this because he's married, it’s just a load of bull. So how can I then accept the very same thing for fear of harassment? Well because it’s the reason that counts. An employee unwilling to compromise because of his marriage is bringing his personal issues into the workplace. The same way this issue crept into the office, other personal issues will invariably soon follow and that's bad news. The latter on the other hand is fearing for his career and by extension showing respect to the company. Anybody finding excuses to fulfill his job is a liability. Anybody however who is concerned about losing the opportunity to be part of the team is worth hanging on to."},{"instruction":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","output":"Q: “Why did Will Smith just slap Chris Rock at the Oscars?” … There is a fundamental reason why this happened, and why you see the same thing happening all around the world. It’s a reason that nobody wants to consider, and the reason why humanity now stands on the precipice of self-destruction, … and the clock is ticking! First, here is a side-by-side photo of Will Smith and Chris Rock as they truly are: They are two prominent celebrities in the entertainment industry. Over the years they have helped us to laugh, cry, and think more deeply about life, who we are, and what we represent. They aren’t bad people. Will and Chris are both beautiful, wonderful individuals. And at their core, they are no different than you and me. The only difference is that “life” has moved them into the world spotlight. If you could rewind the universe to its earliest known origin, you’d discover what’s called the [LINKED_TEXT: hadron epoch] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron_epoch] which began a mere 20 microseconds after the Big Bang. This strange period in universal existence represents a cosmic struggle between hadrons and antihadrons: the fundamental building blocks of everything that exists today. A hadron and antihadron are simultaneously annihilated the instant they come in contact with each other. Yes, the universe was born out of conflict. This same cosmic war has been waging over the past 13.8 billion years in the form of positive and negative, matter and antimatter, strong and weak, predator and prey, life and death, science and religion, and ultimately evolving into love and hate. What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is a fully evolved version of “Existence” showing us who we are, how far we’ve come, and our inevitable demise should we fail to change our direction. Existence is offering us a movie about “us” and using two great actors to deliver its message. Humanity is unknowing dividing into two distinct particle types: Good and Evil. The only problem is that both sides consider their side Good and the other side Evil. Yes, we all have our fully justified reasoning for labeling the “other side” as repugnant, don’t we? However, at the fundamental level “Existence” doesn’t care one way or the other. Existence is indifferent. Existence operates by a set of fundamental properties that have existed since the beginning of time. When oppositional particles come into contact, mutual self-destruction ensues. What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is also taking place between Russia and Ukraine, Democrat and Republican, theist and atheist, gay and straight, black and white, and all other oppositional constructs we’ve unknowingly created over time. The only difference is that we live in a nuclear age where our existence as a species hangs in the balance. There is no doubt that any country that uses nuclear weapons against another will be met with a swift, opposite and equal “smack” because that’s just the way things work, … even at the subatomic level. However, there is hope! We represent the end result of a 13.8-billion-year-long evolution of “Existence” from its most basic, fundamental particles up to living, breathing, self-aware humans who can amazingly rewrite universal law. Yes, “we” have the innate ability to love each other, end our conflicts, and offer forgiveness instead of mutual self-destruction whenever we happen to collide. Will and Chris know what happened was wrong. You can see it in their faces. Chris never should have made that joke and Will never should have reacted as he did. If both could go back in time, no doubt this “particle collision” never would have taken place. All that remains is whether they can show the world that people can forgive each other when we err and continue to live in peace. These two wonderful individuals can turn a terrible event into a message of love and forgiveness that sets an all-new standard going forward. While we wait on the outcome, our wars will still be waging, our hatred will still be dividing us, our weaponry will still increase in strength, … … and the clock is ticking!"},{"instruction":"Do US soldiers keep their guns?","output":"No!

Helps greatly in closing gaps in city traffic than the conventional geared bikes.Storage space under the seat.I have seen people use it to transport anything from another person to half the stuff in home.Anybody with cycle balance can ride it, provide that they have throttle control also. Disadvantages : Average fuel efficiency is less than that of similar capacity geared bike.Top speed is less than that of similar capacity geared bike and it's also recommended not to ride at that speeds for long.Not a highway friendly vehicle. Very unstable at crosswinds.Since the engine is located to the rear there is a problem of handlebar becoming heavy when fully loaded. Also makes the scooter is less stable than a bike with engine centrally located.Cannot be ridden from long distance continuously because of engine over heating.Lower capacity fuel tank. (Enough for a 200-250 km trip)The self maintenance is a pain because mostly you will have to open up the whole scooter to access the engine, battery etc.Pricey compared to some 100cc geared bikes.The CVT can be laggy at times.Not comfortable for long rides. Seems like the disadvantages is more than the advantages. I ride an Activa just because I'm not comfortable on a geared bike. In stop and go city traffic a scooter makes most sense to me and for long rides a geared bike wins hands down. Hope this helps.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you clean your faux rabbit fur area rug: Shake out the rug: Take the rug outside and gently shake it to remove any loose dirt, dust, or debris.Vacuum the rug: Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum with a brush attachment to gently vacuum the rug, starting from one end and working your way to the other. Be sure to use a gentle suction and avoid applying too much pressure, which can damage the fibers.Spot-clean stains: If there are any stains or spills on the rug, spot-clean them using a solution of warm water and mild detergent. Gently blot the stain with a clean, damp cloth until it is removed.Wash the rug: Fill a large sink or bathtub with cool water and add a small amount of mild detergent. Submerge the rug in the water and gently agitate it with your hands. Avoid using a brush or scrubbing the rug, as this can damage the fibers.Rinse the rug: Once the rug has been washed, drain the water and rinse the rug thoroughly with cool water until all of the soap has been removed.Dry the rug: Hang the rug outside or lay it flat on a clean, dry surface to air-dry. Avoid exposing the rug to direct sunlight or heat sources, as this can cause the fibers to shrink or melt.Fluff the rug: Once the rug is dry, use a soft-bristled brush to fluff the fibers and restore its texture. It's important to note that faux rabbit fur rugs can be delicate and may require special care, so always check the care label on your rug for specific cleaning instructions or consult a professional cleaner if you're unsure about the best way to clean your rug."},{"instruction":"Can you tame an older feral cat?","output":"Yes, but it will take a VERY long time, longer the older the cat. Truly feral cats are naturally afraid humans and anything else that could harm them. That’s how they survive. Only long months, maybe even years, of gentle, trustworthy behavior on your part will relax this wariness. That means no scares from you, no attempts to touch, no confinements, etc. Feed the cat a desired food, calling it each time before you do. Provide a warm bed in cold weather. I use fiberglass baby pig warmer mats from the Farm Supply store in my barn. They have the right amount of warmth and are indestructible. I place a cardboard box or, better, a plastic tote, with one side cut off over one end of the mat. The other end is out in the open. That way, they are sheltered from drafts but do not feel cornered. If you have to set this up outside, provide a shelter with a front and back entrance, so the cat knows it can escape. The cat will soon associate you with the food and shelter. Gradually, over time, it will become used to you perhaps so much that you can touch it. Frankly, this is much more likely in kittens and adolescents. Adults are usually ingrained in their wildness, which after all has kept them alive so far."},{"instruction":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","output":"Yes."},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"We lose the fear of losing anything !"},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"Who doesn't enjoy the thought of making money without exerting any effort? That is the ideal, isn't it? Many people misunderstand affiliate marketing because it appears to be an easy method to make money. They believe that all they need to do is cry \\"Buy now!\\" to attract customers. But let's face it, you won't make much money if you're not providing something worthwhile. My experience as an affiliate marketer has taught me some valuable insights about what generates results and what doesn't. I'll share my observations with you now. 1. Clearly understand your subject. The primary focus of affiliate websites is product or service reviews. What is the main focus of these reviews? Real, useful information. If you aren't familiar with what customers want to know about two products, you can't make detailed comparisons between them. The fact is that you won't be able to offer that kind of insight if you don't have a thorough understanding of the topic. Users are intelligent, and they can tell if you're only partially informed. Sure, a little bit of expertise might trick a few people, but if you're serious about expanding your affiliate site, you must actually be an expert. This is especially true for affiliates in specialized sectors where knowledge is essential, such online gambling (which is a popular field for affiliates). 2. Pick a topic that interests you. You have a big advantage in affiliate marketing, but it may also be a disadvantage. You can advertise anything you want. The difficult part is to not choose a specialty just because it has a high conversion rate or makes you instantly rich. That almost never works out, and you'll probably end yourself writing about something you detest. It's common knowledge that pursuing your passions is a key to success, and affiliate marketing is no exception. 3. Refrain from pursuing extremely competitive keywords. Have you heard of affiliate marketers' \\"Holy Grail\\" keywords? They say things like, \\"Best [insert your niche keyword].\\" I can tell you from personal experience that trying to rank for these is a huge challenge. Depending on your niche and the level of competition therein, the challenge fluctuates. However, choosing keywords wisely and being aware of their intent are the keys to success for affiliate marketers. Using keywords intended to convey information in an article with only transactional intents is a major no-no. Focusing on evaluating new and less well-known products is a wonderful way to avoid highly competitive keywords. Instead of competing for old, difficult keywords, you may start ranking for related keywords right away. 4. Check out potential partners before working together. Let me reveal yet another fact. Not all companies will honor their promises to give you commissions. In particular in the area of online gambling, I have personally witnessed this during my affiliate journey. Certain sectors engage in questionable practices. Therefore, it's essential to conduct in-depth study and obtain information from Affiliate forums. Avoid companies that rip off commissions or have ambiguous or unreasonable terms and conditions.

However, a fall in the value of the currency often leads to higher inflation - which hurts people. For example, with a fall in the value of the rupee, the rupee price of oil goes up, even if the dollar price stays the same. This may lead to an increase in the price of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. People will notice that. The fall in the value of the rupee will make exports more competitive - because the same rupees as before now mean a lower dollar price. But, this benefits a limited number of people. No doubt Mr. Modi had criticized Mr. Singh when the rupee declined. Now, it’s hurting Mr. Modi. But, these are just talking points, which mean nothing to most people.

( Marvel’s all female Avengers. ) It just felt like the only reason this group of characters was thrown together was because of their gender rather than because they fit together in a way that serves a story. In contrast, I could easily get behind an all female Guardians. Gamora, Nebula, Mantis, Lady Sif, Valkyrie, Captain Marvel, with new additions like Angela, Quasar, and Moon Dragon on a cosmic adventure… Those characters would just work together. They all have agendas which would usually align and sometimes cross one another. Some take things too seriously and others not seriously enough. You have characters trying to forget their pasts on a ship with an empath. I mean… if you want an all female team, start on the cosmic end where you have enough established characters we’re invested in to build the core then pepper in ones which will sometimes compliment and sometimes antagonize the characters we’re already invested in ( or likely will be in the case of Captain Marvel. ) If you can’t picture Lady Sif joining that team. Or Angela Or Moon Dragon ( Drax’s long lost daughter; a psychic martial artist ) Or Phyla-Vell ( who has taken up the mantle of Captain Marvel and is off and on involved with Moon Dragon ) Even though I can’t recall seeing an all-female group of guardians… esp with the versions we’ve seen in the MCU, there would be stories to tell which grow from who these characters are and how they’d play off each other. Similarly on the Netflix end, I’d watch the fuck out of Daughters of the Dragon ( Misty Knight and Colleen Wing. ) They already have a relationship and their skills and experiences compliment each other in a way that can be better than the sum of their parts. On the Avengers end, who do you have. Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, and maybe a member or two from the Dora Milaje?

These are limited to professions with a shortage of workers in Canada — either skilled (doctors, engineers, nurses, specialized trades, etc.) or highly temporary. The later jobs not longer exist due to Covid and massive Canadian unemployment and even the former are difficult to find due to unemployment and the massive number of companies closing, not expanding, or losing money. If you did get a job offer, you can only bring spouses and dependent children with you. So, you can’t bring a brother — unless he is under 18, your parents are dead, and you are his legal guardian. If your brother is 18+, then he would need to apply on his own, meaning he also has a job offer."},{"instruction":"Why do Glocks and HiPoints look like they are rudimentary, and made for people who just want to say they own a gun?","output":"Exactly what is it you expect a gun to look like?"},{"instruction":"Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?","output":"The orange one did not pick the brightest judges."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"One cat, a beautiful black and white tuxedo, seems to have gone thru several homes before settling in with us.

We located the home before our neighbor. He spent a month at that place and left because a young child played very rough with him. So rough that when they asked if the child could see he was OK and we said yes, the cat ran under the bed the instant he saw the kid. We know there was at least one home before the “bad kid place”. When we decided to let him live with us, we had him thoroughly checked by our vet. He had been neutered and was around 7 or 8 months old! So there were at least three homes before us.

And also you can admit the mistake infront of someone, because admitting your mistake needs and strength, and feeling guilty is your prashchyatap, and not doing it again, is what you learnt from your mistakes. Anyone is not perfect, all makes mistakes, but the one who learns from it and never repeat it again, is really a good person. So, don't worry, Krishna already pardoned you.

So my views on this matter are predictably slanted, but hear me out because I haven't seen this argument made in any of the answers yet. Social Security and Medicare benefits should be doubled, at least. I know, it sounds self-serving, but my concern is not for myself or even for others in my elderly cohort, many of whom depend upon the admittedly meager benefits to survive. My concern is for the Gen-X and millennial generations. How often have you heard younger workers complain that they can't afford to buy a home, or even to rent a livable place because of their reliance on the “gig economy\\"? Their degrees seem worthless because they are barred from access to the most powerful wealth-building tool our society offers: home ownership. Why are they being deprived? Simple -- the older generations are not retiring and making room for them to advance. And why are older workers not retiring? I think you know the answer to this one: they can't afford to retire. That's why I'm still working full-time, even with SS benefits and three pensions between my wife and me. With higher Social Security benefits and more affordable Medicare premiums, I could give up my job, and so could millions of boomers in the same situation. Those higher-paying jobs could go to younger workers who would then leave openings for entry-level workers. As more younger workers advance, they can afford the things they're not buying now, like houses, and the trickle-up economy brings on a huge boom of prosperity. Limiting seniors to miserly benefits is holding back not only seniors, but our entire economy. The very idea that we should actually cut benefits should disqualify any politician from being elected."},{"instruction":"w can I disable security tags from Walmart?","output":"Well you need a special tool to remove the security tags.

However I would say that the best hotel I have ever stayed at was the Etap Marmara Hotel (as it was known then) in Taksim Square, Istanbul, Turkey, where I stayed for five nights, arriving on Wednesday, 16th September 1981 and departing on Monday, 21st September, as you can see from the card below. I also attach some publicity material for the hotel, which I picked up at the time I stayed there. This is in the form of a free standing card, consisting of two parts which fit inside each other. I had arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday, 16th September 1981 having flown from Heathrow Airport that morning on a Turkish Airlines DC-10 airliner and soon settled into my five night stay at the Etap Marmara. Actually I do not recall a great deal about the hotel and all of its facilities (as advertised in those pictures above) because when I stayed there I just passed through the foyer and slept in my bedroom, spending as much time out and about seeing as much of Istanbul as I could. I would make an early start each morning on day long guided sightseeing tours provided as part of the holiday and then I would go out again to different restaurants and night spots in the evening. On the morning of Monday 21st September I checked out of the hotel and flew with Turkish Airlines to Turkey’s capital city of Ankara, staying there for two nights in the Hotel Dedeman before flying home again on Wednesday, 23rd August. Today the hotel where I stayed in Istanbul all those years ago is known as the Marmara Taksim Hotel and I attach two pictures of it below :- I would guess that maybe it is not quite such a prestigious hotel now as it was back in 1981 when I stayed there, as other hotels will have opened in the meantime, or been upgraded. Perhaps someone who has been to Istanbul more recently or stayed in this particular hotel can add a comment on this. Anyway, you might well be wondering how I could afford to stay at a place like this when I did, but to let you into a little secret. I was not paying for it, because that whole week long trip to Turkey was a prize I had won in a competition. In those days one of my hobbies was listening to international short wave broadcast from the various countries of the world, and one station I listened to was the Voice of Turkey. The competition was one in which listeners were invited to write an essay about the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. I was very surprised to learn that my essay was one of the ten winning entries, and so I and all of the other winners were invited to spend an all expense week in Turkey, staying in Istanbul and Ankara. When I went I was accompanied by three other prizewinners – one from the U.K., one from France and one from Germany, and we became friends and got to know each other really well too. The remaining six prizewinners visited the following month. Even 37 years later now, I rate this week’s visit to Turkey as the best prize I have ever won in my entire life, because I have never been a great winner of prizes. I should say in conclusion that I have never returned to Istanbul (or Ankara) since that visit in 1981, and though I did return to Turkey it was not until 33 years later in 2014, this time flying to Antalya on the Mediterranean coast and going by coach to the surreal landscapes of Cappadocia. I was glad to have the opportunity to visit Cappadocia at last, because I had heard that the other party of prizewinners back in 1981 had been taken to Cappadocia whereas my party had not, so I had always felt rather envious of them. Also when I went to Cappadocia I enjoyed an experience that none of those prizewinners did, because I had a hot air balloon ride."},{"instruction":"What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?","output":"He will have to run away .... there is sequential system of managers ,they will kick the delivery boy (...)...... so he will run after the thief as i think, also my words might be just craps ...."},{"instruction":"Which is the best ethical hacking course?","output":"Hi, You can checkout this course.This course includes Practicals too, So you can easily understand everything.

I’m greatly intrigued by the widespread belief in the myth that the UK paid for Lend-Lease (and sometimes even the Marshall Plan). It’s fascinating that a modern people could believe in such legends. What they paid for were post-war loans from the US and Canada; indeed, anything they chose to keep AFTER the war that originated from Lend-Lease was rolled into these loans - at 10% of its production cost. [LINKED_TEXT: Anglo-American loan - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Loan from the US to the UK after World War II Signature of the loan. Bottom row from left: economist John Maynard Keynes , leader of the British negotiators; Lord Halifax , British Ambassador to the US ; James F. Byrnes , United States Secretary of State ; and Fred M. Vinson , United States Secretary of the Treasury . Future US Secretary of State Dean Acheson stands third from right in the back row. The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946, enabling its economy after the Second World War to keep afloat. [1] The loan was negotiated by British economist John Maynard Keynes and American diplomat William L. Clayton . Problems arose on the American side, with many in Congress reluctant, and with sharp differences between the treasury and state departments. The loan was for 3.75 billion at a low 2% interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US1.19 billion. The British economy in 1947 was hurt by a provision that called for convertibility into dollars of the wartime sterling balances the British had borrowed from India and others, but by 1948, the Marshall Plan included financial support that was not expected to be repaid. The entire loan was paid off in 2006, after it was extended six years. Background [ edit ] At the start of the war, Britain had spent the money that she did have in normal payments for materiel under the \\"US cash-and-carry \\" scheme. Basing rights were also traded for equipment, e.g., the Destroyers for Bases Agreement , but by 1941 Britain was no longer able to finance cash payments and Lend-Lease was introduced. The Lend Lease Act provided aid for free on the basis that such help was essential for the defense of the United States. Congress passed the final extension of the act on April 16th, 1945, extending the aid for another year while adding an amendment stating that no aid could be provided for postwar relief or reconstruction. Large quantities of goods were in Britain or in transit when the Lend Lease Act was terminated on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (constituting 55% of GDP in 1944) and had drastically reduced its exports. [2] The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities such as food while it could no longer afford to pay for these items using export profits. The end of Lend-Lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 cents on the dollar, giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.

He made his own way out to the frontier (the Western Reserve) and worked to support himself, all the while educating himself. When he returned to Pennsylvania a few years later, he badgered the school system to let him take an equivalency exam to get his diploma, which they didn’t want to grant. He passed it flawlessly.

Additionally, the physiques of actors like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel are often the result of a combination of genetics, intense training, and strict dieting. While elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo rigorous physical training, they typically have different priorities and goals than professional bodybuilders or actors preparing for a role.

Beauty has a limit on how much it can serve and entertain other people. Once you have served everything you have, there's nothing else that you can bring forth. After a certain period of time, your beauty isn't exciting, it becomes repetitive and rusty thus making it useless for you to use it as a weapon to sharp your personality. But, there's one weapon that never gets rusty, borning, repitive and unexciting. Your Brain. My advice is that rather than investing money and time for your beauty, invest for your brain. I am not asking you to roam like a witch.(Pun Intended). It is totally upto you how you want to look. But, I'm asking you to set your priorities right. And your priority should be sharpening your brain, not your beauty. May be instead of Maybelline New York or L’oreal Paris products, you can go with other cheaper options to save a lot of money. And then use that money to buy books or subscriptions of magazines or anything for brainstorming.

In addition to online travel agencies and airlines' official websites, there are also[LINKED_TEXT: several travel hacking strategies and rewards programs] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/] that can help you save money on flights. In this article, we'll explore some of these options and provide tips for finding the best deals. Travel Hacking Travel hacking is the practice of using various travel strategies and tactics to save money on flights, hotels, and other travel expenses. One of the most [LINKED_TEXT: popular travel hacking strategies] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/] for finding cheap flights is to use credit card rewards points. Many credit card companies offer rewards programs that allow you to earn points or miles for purchases, which can then be redeemed for flights or other travel expenses. To maximize your rewards points, it's important to choose the right credit card for your travel needs. Look for cards that offer bonus points for travel purchases or sign-up bonuses that can give you a head start on earning points. It's also important to stay organized and keep track of your rewards points, so you can use them before they expire. Another travel hacking strategy for finding cheap flights is to use airline alliances to your advantage. Many airlines are part of larger alliances, such as Star Alliance or OneWorld, which allows travelers to earn and redeem miles on multiple airlines. By strategically booking flights on different airlines within the same alliance, you can [LINKED_TEXT: earn more miles and potentially save money on flights] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/]. 2.

These programs allow you to earn miles or points for flights or other purchases, which can then be redeemed for free or discounted flights. To maximize your rewards program benefits, it's important to choose the right program for your travel needs. [LINKED_TEXT: Look for programs that offer generous rewards for frequent flyers] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/], as well as programs that have partnerships with other airlines or travel providers.

One of the most important tips is to be flexible with your travel dates and times. Flights can often be significantly cheaper if you're willing to travel on weekdays or during off-peak times. It's also important to book your flights well in advance, as prices tend to go up as the travel date approaches. However, it's also important to be aware of last-minute deals and flash sales, which can sometimes offer significant discounts on flights. Finally, it's important to compare prices across multiple platforms and airlines before booking. While it may be tempting to book the first cheap flight you find, taking the time to compare prices can often save you even more money in the long run. In conclusion, [LINKED_TEXT: there are many options available for finding cheap flight tickets,] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/product/e-book-how-to-travel-cheaper-smarter-and-safer/] from online travel agencies and airlines' official websites to travel hacking strategies and rewards programs.

For example “with a high IQ think a LOT faster”… how could you ever know? You cannot compare your mind to other people’s because you’ll never know how they think… You’re bound to your own, single perception… That being said, from my own experience as someone who was an IQ of around 150, it’s absolute bull shit. Never helped me a day in my life.

First that premise is not technically correct - Java is not bad for 3D games - It’s bad for 3D games requiring quick refresh rates like GTA or a fighting game like Doom or Hexen. Because Java has issues with speed, it doesn’t handle refresh too well. I rewrote PacMan in Java using Swing and that’s just a 2D game so I could handle 60 fps but if that was rewritten using 3D with 3D model and material textures and shading and stuff, then that would push the limits especially if you have particle effects like fire and explosions and waterfalls and stuff like that. Minecraft - I’ve never played but my understanding from seeing YouTube Videos on the game are that it doesn’t involve that high refresh rates so it can be coded probably even in Python as speed is not essential for mere 3D programming."},{"instruction":"Which Turkic country has the purest Turks?","output":"There is no purest anything.

There are many enduring guitar designs, but none that are still as popular and useful. Its funny too, because there have been many improvements and variants of the design, yet the most popular ones that are those closest to the original model. What really pushes the Strat over the top is its versatility. It is ergonomically comfortable, relatively inexpensive even for good quality models, it can be used for just about any genre requiring an electric guitar. They are also very reliable. If they had any drawback it was that the single coil picks had a lot of noisy hum at high volumes. The humbucking pickups in Gibson guitars have allowed Gibson to give the Strat a run for its money, but many people are willing to put up with the “hum” to get the unique tones that only a Strat can provide. Fender has since been able to capture the same tone in a noiseless pick up, so what more can you ask for?"},{"instruction":"What is your opinion of Adam Schiff presenting indisputable evidence that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia and criticising the GOP?","output":"My opinion is that he is lower than toenail fungus.

The users will have to choose one or more SMTP servers of their choice and connect it with Pro. Once done with the integration process, users will be able to send emails to the subscribers.

I mean, the two weren’t particularly discreet about it. They shared a luxury apartment together in Coruscant like, right next to the Jedi Temple. It seemed obvious that Anakin lived there with Padme, not just making nightly booty calls. Padme wasn’t some random nobody, she was one of the most prominent senators, she was a noblewoman with an entourage. Her entourage must know. And people gossip. And even “the dark side cloud everything” blah blah blah, the Jedi masters surely hear rumors. Ashoka knew. Pretty sure Obi-Wan knew. I think the Jedi Council chose to ignore it because 1) Anakin was a highly capable, well regarded general, and was needed for the Clone war effort. 2) Anakin wasn’t just married to a nobody, he was married to one of the most prominent senators, the Jedi Council didn’t want to piss off Padme. 3) I think most importantly, the Jedi council, Yoda, or Windu, they just didn’t know how to approach this without some massive repercussions from Anakin and Padme, both immensely powerful during the Clone Wars. So they turned their heads and pretend nothing happened. Besides, Jedi's teaching was against attachment, I guess Yoda and Windu be like “who knows, maybe Anakin and Padme are just friends with benefits. That’s not against the law, right?” This is why I think Yoda was a horrible mentor. He obviously knew Anakin was in love with Padme. Everyone could see that. Anakin wasn’t very good at hiding his feelings towards Padme. And when Anakin came to Yoda to discuss his paranoia about Padme’s death, Yoda gave him some surface-level advice about attachment, basically telling him to “touch it up”. He didn’t offer Anakin any actual help or actionable advice. If he realized anything after Mustafar, I sure hope he realized how horrible a teacher he was, and he had utterly failed at pretty much everything a Jedi Master should be doing: mentoring, leading, detecting the dark side… … Nope. Probably not. Judging from his initial attitude towards Luke, Yoda was too arrogant to learn anything.

They certainly sidestep the problem of liquid fuels that can go bad in storage and eventually damage the engine (eg gasoline).

Leave few topics or even subject: Due to vast syllabus of GATE few students leave few topics or chapters. Which are not very important. This is a conclusion based on analysis that from these topics very rarely question in asked but that's not a good practice . As GATE might surprise you asking 2 easy questions from that topic. 3.

Jimmy Carter is the smallest blue line and debt stays at the same place. Ronald Reagan is important. He is the start of the republicans not caring about the debt. Big tax decreases combined with much more military spending led to triple the amount of debt as before his presidency. George H. W. Bush continued these debt increasing policies until recession hit. Bill Clinton increased taxes and stopped spending so much, a budget surplus was the result. George W. Bush decided to give the surplus, “back to the American people” and cut taxes. The Afghanistan War (justified) and Iraq War (unjustified) did not stop him from decreasing taxes one the rich further despite how important the Iraq war was. Barack Obama increased taxes mildly and the deficit did not go away, but it did decrease. And now Donald Trump. His tax plan is more giveaways to the rich with a deficit that doubled in 1 year. The biggest differences pre-Reagan and post-Reagan was Keynesian economics. It was the economic theory that you spend in recession and save in an expansion. With that theory, America had debt decreases every year until the 1970s. I will admit that Supply-Side economics worked temporarily, but it only works for short periods of time before it only benefits the rich while Keynesian is in it for the long haul. The Republican party only wants cuts while the Democratic party is the party of money saving."},{"instruction":"w would you describe each Stray Kids member in one word?","output":"okie dokie lets get it- ✨❤️ Bang Chan❤️✨ OIyep that about sums it up ✨❤️ Lee Know❤️✨ CatHe has cats, He looks like a cat, He is cat ✨❤️Changbin ❤️✨ ThickMy mans was on the skinny side but now he THICKThis is a good thing ✨❤️ Hyunjin ❤️✨ Dramahe looks like that one person in movies who is savage but everyone loves himthe faces he be makin says Drama King…….we stanthen again he is very dramatic ✨❤️ Han❤️✨ cheekslike my mans cheeks be poppinSO FLUFFY ✨❤️ Felix❤️✨ Memethis guy is a living memeknows all the current memesis quietly stalking us on the internet (along with Bang Chan) ✨❤️ Seungmin❤️✨ softboyHe looks so softhe can be so calmI wanna hugggggg ✨❤️ I.N ❤️✨ lifehear me outWhen i.n was a baby When I.N was a child When I.N was a teenager When I.N was a adult When I.N was old He is the process of life ✨-Started on my ambitions-✨ -LuXun loves you"},{"instruction":"Why do people vape?","output":"To be honest it's helps me with to deal with my stress and I did since I was 13 now soon I'll be 19 next month"},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"I will keep it simple.

Let's name him Sagar. So Sagar, a 45 years old man, is living with his friends in Surat. They also work together in a factory. Drinking alcohol and smoking after coming from the factory is not new for them. They do it almost everyday. Sagar also enjoys his life to the fullest with his roommates cum friends. One day at the time of enjoying their life on their building roof they decided to do some TOOFANI. One suggested to jump from the building, and another suggested to rape a lady who stays in the same building. But finally one suggested, \\"Let's put this steel glass into one of our anuses.\\" Everyone jumped happily by listening to this unique and innovative idea.. What else can be the best way to enjoy life with friends! They all tried with themselves but couldn't. Then asked Sagar. He shyly agreed to take the challenge. All were getting drunk. Their brains already stopped working. All the zombies finally inserted a steel glass in a zombie named Sagar's anus. It was obviously painful but how they say \\"anything for friends\\". Task over. They slept. In the morning, when Sagar turned a human from a zombie he realised what had happened with his last night. He tried by himself to pull out the glass, but couldn't. He then thought let it be in my anus, what's the big deal. After two days he returned to his home because of his unbearable stomach pain, but being ashamed he did not say anyone in his family about it. Six days have passed. That glass is in his stomach now. He couldn't poop and his stomach became a pumpkin by then. He is still not telling anyone about the exact reason, not even to doctors and consuming medicines after medicines prescribed by doctors. On the eighth day, which means 19th August, his family members admitted him to the hospital. When the doctor x-rayed them they found out this. Source: screenshot of a newspaper. At first doctors tried their best to get out of the glass through his anus, meaning the way it was inserted. Since the glass has already reached his upper stomach, they failed to pull it out as they planned. So they had to operate on him. Operation was not easy because they had to cut his alimentary tract (food passage). It continued for around two long hours. By the grace of God, the operation was successful. He is fine now. As I said, it's not a story, it's a real incident that happened a week ago. The news was also published in an Odia daily yesterday, the screenshot I had posted above. Now let's come to the question: what is the real meaning of friendship? Friendship is not about drinking, flirting with girls or watching movies together. It doesn't even mean inserting glass in a friend's anus. Real friendship is when one cares for his/her friends more than joking. You don't need to act crazy or behave nuts in the name of friendship. You can be a friend with a mature mind. When a friend forces you to do or not do something, it is best to stay away from that friend. The issue is that we all know what's right and wrong, but we can't distinguish when we're in the middle of it. After meeting with your friends, analyse what you did when you were with your friends. You can continue the friendship if you don't think you did anything harmful to yourself, your future or anyone else."},{"instruction":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","output":"First, let them cut their own pensions and other retirement benefits.

So here I go. Sorry for cheating. 2011- 16yo I was young and had a baby face. I couldn't gros a beard and didn't even imagine what I wanted to do in life. 2012–17yo I was taking my independence, starting to make some life changing decisions. 2012 was the year I started to be called “sir” by teenagers younger than me. It was the year I broke up with my first girlfriend ever, so it was a kind of a shock. And every shock leads to a reaction that is proportionnally equal. It led to 2013… 2013 - 18yo It was the year I got my first tattoo, and had my last holidays for a long time. I shaved my head for no fucking reason. And it looked awkward as hell. In November I decided to start stretching my left ear, so I did it, and kept going on the way I wanted to. At the end of 2013 I had really changed. I had two tattoos while I didn’t at the beginning of 2013. I had change my field of studies. I pierced my ear. It was a shock for my parents. They didn’t understand what I was doing. 2014 - 19yo I met Jared Leto and my girlfriend of this time. It was a real change in my life. It really was a moment of truth for me (for many reasons). Well it wasn’t holidays, it was just a week-end on tour with a great band (Thirty Seconds To Mars). As you can see on those three pictures, I look way older than in the previous pictures. I don’t know if it is the beard, or just my face getting sharper, but I stopped looking my age during this period of time. 2015 - 20yo I kept changing. I started to go the gym and kept it this way for a year, but it didn’t really change me whatever I could do. This year I started looking more professional and more adult. The way I was clothed, and maybe my attitude changed it. My beard was getting thicker and thicker. 2016 - 21 yo I dyed my hair blond for a while, and here is what it looked like ! I also adopted this haircut that everybody seemed to have, even if I couldn’t admit it :( And here it is. Me, right now. I try to grow a stache to see how it looks like on me. And I keep getting tattooed, because that’s part of me. I don’t know in which way I’ve really changed, but I feel way better with my body right now, that I felt 5 years ago. It has made me more confident, more authentic, and more me. I’ve been through a lot of things and I think that all those changes can be seen on me through those pictures. In 2011 I was a teenager and had no idea what my life could be made of, and now I’m trying to secure my future and to live as much as possible. I find myself more attractive now than before, even though I try not to be arrogant about this feeling.

Or GIGO from the mathematical standpoint. The garbage in is the presumption that one, and only one amino acid sequence (protein) can do a job. That is totally false. Cytochrome c is an essential protein for metabolism. But look at the chart at this site: [LINKED_TEXT: Biological Molecules 6: An introduction to molecular biology and evolution] [URL: http://biologicalphysics.iop.org/cws/article/lectures/47042] It shows how many different amino acid sequences (cytochrome c’s) can do that job. And all of these sequences do so equally well. Now imagine all the sequences that could do the job almost as well, then imagine all the sequences that can do the job OK, then all the sequences that would be less than OK but still not bad, then all the sequences that could do the job just a little bit. It might help you to think of the game of bridge. Calculate the odds of getting any particular bridge hand. It is very small. But you don’t need a particular bridge hand to play bridge, do you? Any hand will do. Deal out 13 cards to each player and you have a playable bridge hand. Pretty much the same applies to proteins. Make proteins by thermally heating them and each protein will have a biological activity. We won’t know which one, but it will have one. Probably 2 or more (since many proteins have 2 enzymatic activities or are an enzyme and a membrane protein). With tRNAs, there are lots of RNA configurations. All of them will have tri-nucleotides that can potentially bind mRNA and there is nothing mysterious in having an amino acid bind to the 3′ end. Initially, the 3 loop configuration would not be necessary. People have looked at the evolution of tRNAs. One paper is: 4. Margaret E. Saks, Jeffrey R. Sampson, John Abelson Evolution of a transfer RNA gene through a point mutation in the anticodon. Science, 279, Number 5357 Issue of 13 March 1998, pp. 1665 - 1670. Once you get to the point of having just a little activity, then natural selection makes it a virtual certainty that, eventually, you will get a very efficient protein or tRNA. Natural selection cuts down odds. It is important to remember that natural selection is cumulative. Let me give you are very simple example: You have a 1 in 1024 chance of correctly winning 10 coin tosses in a row. But I can guarantee you I can find someone who can do so. How? Simple, use cumulative selection in the form of a single elimination tournament. I start with 1024 people and pair them up. Then each pair tosses a coin. The 512 winners are selected to go to the next round. Again they are paired and do a coin toss; the 256 winners are selected to go to the next round. Repeat this 7 more times. Now you have 2 people who have won 9 coin tosses in a row. The winner of this round has won 10 coin tosses in a row. And it is a certainty that such a person will be found with this method. We have taken odds of 1 in 1024 and converted that into virtual certainty. Now, I don't know which individual will win the tosses, but it is certain that one of them will, given the algorithm of the competition. Evolution by natural selection is a competition algorithm, more complex but analogous to the single elimination tournament algorithm. It converts long odds to virtual certainty."},{"instruction":"w can I get a free Hotstar membership?","output":"Yes, You can do it, sounds creazy but their are some simple steps to get an premium accounts.

In this film however, the storyline was as good as the acting by Sanjana Sanghi and of course, Sushant Singh Rajput. ❤️👏🏽 I definitely would give this movie a 100/5 star rating if I could. It was a real tearjerker, an amazing touching movie which is a must-watch, and a beautiful tribute to Sushant. I might even say that I loved it a lot more than the original movie, and I loved that one a lot. The plot set and changed for this version is smart, so heartwarming and fit very well with the meaning behind it. 💯"},{"instruction":"What are the things you shouldn't share on social media?","output":"Things that will promote international distrust, terrorism, lack of trust in one’s country, sharing things on social media that will negatively affect the economy, things that will gain you approval from others and your Internet Provider for very bad reasons, things that will stop censorship on the Internet for evil purposes, things that will infringe upon people’s rights and freedoms, things that are selfish and don’t benefit everyone and society by what you share on social media, adult content without consent but you can still share adult content between 2 consenting adults, saying bad things about people on social media when they are beneficial to your personal life just because they did things other people in your life consider inappropriate, things about discouraging people from sharing things when it’s to benefit everyone and society when others in your life don’t wanna benefit everyone and society and consider the posts inappropriate and sharing things that are against correcting your mistakes and correcting the punishment and staying out of trouble and fixing problems based on what you share online etc."},{"instruction":"Do you think you have ever met a Russian spy?","output":"This would be in keeping with the idea of individual freedom, in that, each person should be free to define his own thinking and his own life absent those real actions, not opinions, that are detrimental to another or to society. In keeping with the tradition of American freedom to think independently as noted here with a Thomas Jefferson quote from 1802 in a letter to the Baptist Bishops of Danbury CT. The Bishops were intent on making the Baptist Church the default religion of the new “Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \\"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” Freedom of religion is a great deal more that deciding what god one may or may not believe in; it is the freedom to think independently, to hold with value those opinions that may differ from others or from government as opposed to a government sponsored and centered belief, which in itself may become intellectually stifling and oppressive to the imaginative mind. Freedom of Religion is also freedom from a religious mandate to believe or to hold one religious belief above all others. The definition of religion is simply the claim that my belief is of “supreme importance” which may also apply to that secular or political ideology and even to that atheistic belief or opinion that gods do not exist. Religious belief is not exclusive to the supernatural, but, rather, inclusive of all opinion. As an Atheist, my Atheism is my opinion of life and living, my religious belief, and I consider it of “supreme Importance” to me, and do I believe that others should think the same, yes, I do. Do I believe that I should make or force others to believe as I do, no. Hopefully there will come a day, in keeping with the thought, the wish and the dream of Martin Luther King, that we are judged not by the god one may or may not belief in, ”—- but by the content of their character.” “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Martin Luther King, Jr. To respond directly to the question of what religion is best for America and in keeping with the definition of religion as something of supreme importance, I would say that the American Constitution is, by far, the best religion for Americ"},{"instruction":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

Too many people have too many reasons on what to do and when. I hate this, because getting pregnant creates the next generation of the human race. If a woman wants an abortion, then I agree she has the right to have the elective surgery to remove a growing portion of her body, like an appendix or a kidney. Until the umbilical cord connecting the fetus to her body is cut the fetus is a part of her body. Therefore she can do anything she wants to it, including bashing in the skull as long as the umbilical cord is not cut. The moment it is cut the fetus becomes a human being with rights to survive. HOWEVER, since it is “Her body, her choice,” I do not want to pay for her abortion. I want the next generation to be born. I want the human race to continue to exist. SO, if a woman wants an abortion to terminate the results of an act she chose to do, she should pay for the elective surgery to eliminate the growth that is a part of her body. If she cannot pay for it herself, then she can get a charity to help her raise the money to pay for her elective surgery, HOWEVER I do not want to pay for her elective surgery when I do not agree with her desires to eliminate the fetus. THEREFORE, NO CHARITY should get any federal funds to destroy a part of her body in an elective surgery. She got pregnant by her choice, she should pay to stop her choice. She can get an abortion paid for by the government is she was raped or is the victim of incest. HOWEVER she must press charges with the police and the courts to get an abortion. The rapist must pay for his crime. If she lies to get the abortion, she should be prosecuted for theft of funds.

De feu celeste au Royal edifice, Quand la Lumiere du Mars deffaillira, Sept mois grand’ guerre, mort gent de malefice, Rouen, Evreux, au Roy ne faillira. Celestial fire on the Royal edifice, When the light of Mars fails, Seven months the Great War, people dead of evil-doing, Rouen, Evreux shall not fall to the King. Clearly the most enigmatic line is the second, which seems to contain an opportunity to date the quatrain by reference to a heavenly sign. Quand la Lumiere du Mars deffaillira, The term when ‘Mars failing’ suggests a situation in which Mars goes in to retrograde. This will happen on September 11th this year. There are two events that will take place, Covid-19 has mutated into a more deadly strain and will end up killing millions of people around the world from September to April 2021 (7 months).World War 3 (7 months). Because these are happening within the same time period, America will be most vulnerable during this time. This Great war is said to last seven months, so it will probably end in a nuclear conflict between Capitalism and it’s allies on the one side and communism and its allies on the other. The Asian subcontinent is already a “powder keg” waiting to explode. Some authors have attributed this Prophecy to World War 1. The continuing collapse of the Ottoman Empire coincided with the rise of nationalism in the Balkans, which led to increased tensions and conflicts in the region. This “powder keg” was thus a major catalyst for the outbreak of World War I. There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and spheres of influence between the major European powers, such as the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire and, to a lesser degree, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom, and Kingdom of Italy. Within these nations, there were movements to create “greater” nations: to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (termed irredentism). Israel’s annexation plan for occupied West Bank is a “powder keg” in the Middle East waiting to explode, in a bid to a make a Greater Israel. This is precisely what we see with China also, making excessive maritime claims in the South China Sea over disputed territories, challenging “freedom of navigation” and more recently extending its claims to a territory on land disputed by both China and India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh sector. At the heart of the matter is that since early May the Chinese side had been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC. If Pakistan gets dragged into the conflict, Kashmir and Lahore will become disputed territories of a Greater India, than it won’t just be ambers, we’re looking at a situation starting with a minor incident that could spiral out of control with an all out nuclear confrontation. With the Intermediate-Range (INF) Treaty having expired in August, 2019 and the New Start Long-Range Nuclear Treaty expiring on Feb 5, 2021, we could have a nuclear arms race starting in September and ending in April 2021. History is simply repeating itself, we haven’t learnt our lessons from history. The great sixteenth-century French astrologer Morin de Villefranche, who was born 17 years after Nostradamus died, continued the medieval tradition of astrology by insisting that retrograde planets had an action contrary to their direct effects. This is to say that the strong planet Mars would be weak (defaillier) when retrograde. Morin was merely summarizing the astrological beliefs with which Nostradamus was familiar. “ How does this tradition of a retrogradation apply to the astrological conditions surrounding the events of the First World War? The retrogra¬ dation of Mars occurred only twice during the long period of this war. In the first instance, Mars went retrograde on January 1, 1916, and returned to direct motion on March 22, 1916. It was in direct motion for just over two years, until February 4, 1918, when once again it went retrograde. It was during the second period of retrograde motion, precisely as Nostradamus had foreseen, that the Long Max cannons began to project celestial fire on Paris. However, the fact of the retrogradation of Mars ties in with the Sept mois grand’guerrofine three. The extraordinary fact is that after the retrogradation of Mars there remains only a period of seven months to the end of the war. The period between the ending of the retrograde motion of Mars, on April 26, 1918, and the Armistice, on November 11,1918, is actually 6 months and 15 days. May we take it as a sign of the genius of Nostradamus that he should use the very same term to describe this human conflict (grand*guerre) is those who participated in it? Until a further period of reciprocal destruction reduced this conflict to the status of the First World War, it was always referred to as the Great War. Such is the extraordinary power of Nostradamus' vision that he was able to perceive a cosmic event which would parallel (not cause, we venture to emphasize) a period in the first of the wars he predicts for this century."},{"instruction":"f you tell a taxi or Uber driver to just drive, where will they go?","output":"Nowhere.

Am I missing something very obvious?","output":"I've seen a lot of excellent answers, but they've not given Little Finger enough credit. He was one of the three most intelligent and sly male characters in Westeros. There are several reasons he gave Sansa to Bolton. Yes, in his mind, to make her claim more legitimate. The longer she stayed by Robin, the more likely people would pair them together. Sansa's claim would then go down in value. It would go to Robin, her eventual husband. He is her relation. He has bannermen. He could rule in Winterfell once Ramsey was defeated. He could tell Robin liked Sansa and the natural pairing by the people wasn't what he wanted.There was a chance Bolton could fall to Stannis and Sansa would then be free of him. Sansa then would be ideally placed in Winterfell. And Little Finger could marry her, or that was his plan.Bolton could kill Sansa like he did the rest of the Starks. No one is thinking about this aspect of Little Finger. He is in love with Sansa. He wants her for himself. But he wants the throne more. Remember, he loved Katelyn, but he set about to have Bran killed. Realistically, he knew Bolton's chance of keeping Winterfell was slim. Eventually he would fall. Either by hands internally because he was so brutal. Or because too many were gunning for him externally- the Northmen, Stannis, Cersei, and eventually Dany with her dragons. He knew Bolton's days were numbered. Sansa may live. Or she may not. If she does, and Robin mysteriously died too *gasp*, then Little Finger would be the lone survivor in the North “loyal” to both King's Landing and his bannermen. He was ideally placed. He looked at the chessboard and thought, place piece called “Sansa” here.Last reason, Little Finger thought there's a chance he could sweep in and save Sansa like he did in the battle between Jon and Bolton. And then Sansa would see him as a savior. But he miscalculated. Little Finger was a brothel owner. He married Katelyn's sister. He was used to breaking women. But he miscalculated with Kate and Sansa. They're Starks. And they know how to weather the hard winters and become strong. “You taught me well,” Sansa tells Little Finger before she has him executed."},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

They took great risks so some one else wouldn’t have to take an even greater risk. Plus when you’re the fastest in the air and every one was running scared when you turned up is a massive ego trip which gave them more courage (less thought for consequences), which was probably enhanced by the “boys club” attitude at the RAF and hearing back all the horror stories from the front and from the German bombing raids.

Sunrise. It’s very beautiful from our east window; it’s daybreak! A different time depending on what time of year it is. Right now it’s getting later and later. We couldn’t see anything, however, for the past week due to several wildfires burning east of us. The Bolt Creek fire started on September 10th, 2022, and has burned almost 15,000 acres. They wouldn’t put it out for over a month because everyone was making too much money off it. And now the developers can invade and start building their big housing monstrosities, because the trees are gone. All those who moved to Snohomish and Index and all those towns over there to get away from it all can expect overpopulation. And everything that comes with it. Traffic, crime, higher taxes and on and on… Our air quality in Seattle, usually perfect, was globally the worst. Worse than all of China or New Delhi, India. It was deemed hazardous, and must have gone to the rating below that. They wouldn’t tell us what that was. People were getting hoarse voices, headaches, and eye problems. Terrible for asthmatic people. I apparently have acute bronchospasm. And my doctor wouldn’t refill my prescription for my rescue inhaler unless I made an appointment and went to his office in the smoke. So, I did without. Even though the smoke was in our house! For someone to blatantly blackmail you using your life’s breath as leverage is a total deal breaker, for me. Then, at last, this past week the much-anticipated rains began.

Take a look at the comparison of JIO MEET with the ZOOM application What's Similar There are a couple of similarities between JioMeet and Zoom. Firstly, the design of the two video conferencing platforms. JioMeet has a simple interface and looks a lot similar to Zoom. While Zoom presents a light blue color, JIO MEET highlights a dark blue shade. Both JioMeet and Zoom support direct calls, including 1:1 calls as well as large groups of up to 100 participants. One of the reasons for Zoom's popularity is because it provides numerous enterprise-grade host controls. Zoom offering settings where participants can enter a meeting only if the host permits him to. Similar features can be found on JioMeet as well. Further, both JioMeet and Zoom are free to up, at least up to 100 participants in a group. The meetings can be password-protected and both have the waiting room feature. The meetings can be held in HD quality as well. What’s Different There are a couple of features that are exclusive to JioMeet. Reliance notes that the JioMeet app can support multi-device login support, on up to five devices, and you can seamlessly switch between devices while on a call. As the exclusive feature, JioMeet includes Safe Driving Mode to allow users to continue their meeting en route. One of the major concerns about Zoom is its security infrastructure. Both on the app and the web, there were many instances of a security lapse. Incidents of ‘Zoom bombing', where persons unrelated to the group meet were spotted regularly. Further, Zoom introduced end-to-end encryption, but it came with a catch. Zoom noted that only paid users would get the best security of the platform, while free users wouldn't. Nevertheless, Zoom introduced a couple of security upgrades, but there were unsatisfactory. Moreover, a lot of organizations and governments advised people to avoid using Zoom. With JioMeet in the picture, there's still a lot we don't know about the platform. As JioMeet is now available to the public, we'll know how it operates and more about its functionality. For now, JioMeet seems like the go-to option against Zoom, especially because it comes as an Indian alternative.

So he studied various religions and found flaws and vulnerabilities in almost every one of them. He like Buddhism because it preached non-violence, peace and equality. It was also a simple and logical religion. Ambedkar revived old Buddhism in a new form called 'navayana' or 'neo-buddhism' which was distinct from other varieties of East Asian Buddhism which was riddled with idol worship and blind faith."},{"instruction":"w can I learn a dance?

Practice at home: If you're not ready to take a class yet, try practicing at home. You can find instructional videos online, or simply put on some music and move your body. 4. Attend dance events: Going to dance events, such as parties, concerts, or performances, can help you get a sense of the style and culture of the dance you're interested in. 5. Be patient and persistent: Learning to dance takes time and practice, so don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Stick with it and keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time.

Lying to your partner about something significant can be a major betrayal of trust. Withholding important information or hiding something significant from your partner can also be a betrayal of trust. Having an emotional affair with someone outside of your relationship even if there is no physical intimacy or infidelity can be a huge betrayal of trust. This is one of the hardest to discover and usually a prelude to actual cheating or infidelity. This is usually the best time to nip it in the bud or do something about the state of things in the relationship.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","output":"Caution: READ CAREFULLY… No this won't be true because if you remember before breaking that vibranium shield, Thanos had to suffer some seriously unexpectedly strong blows from it. Remember that incredible combo moves which cap used while welding mjolnir for the first time. How did he master the use of mjolnir, is a different story. But it was for sure that Thanos was flabbergasted with the blows from Cap and thus got enraged to a very great extent. Being enraged to this extent he had lost his focus and Cap was just showing him that he is the one of the greatest combatants alive. But the reason why the shield was broken is something interesting. I personally believe that the shield wasn't broken it was teared or sliced in a way. Cause that's the only way vibranium would break (in a sense). Many of the people may know that Thanos' sword was some heavenly metal (possibly Uru) which was razor sharp ( Even sharper than it). Vibranium on the other side can absorb and has absorbed huge amount of vibrations. It was broken because Thanos was furious about getting some seriously big blows from a puny human (basically wrong assumption). Thanos who usually punches very hard, just imagine he is furious now and is gonna deal with a human (sorry😅) almost half his size. Thank god and thank his shield that he avoided some serious injuries. So your theory that Tony has given some other shield or metal shield to Cap is false and it has to be.

Ignoring issues of legality (which vary by location), you should use whichever one you like better. There are a lot of solid arguments for using weed instead of alcohol. As a cop, I don’t think I’ve ever been attacked by someone who was high on weed. I wouldn’t even care to count the number of people who have attacked me while I was drunk. And I know that weed isn’t specifically good for you, but my layman’s understanding is that it doesn’t wreak quite the havoc on your body that alcohol can. And it’s far less addictive. But I like alcohol better. Granted, I haven’t smoked weed in over two decades, so if I were to try it again maybe I’d have a different opinion. But I don’t really like being high… one hit, and I was useless for a couple of hours. I can drink more or less depending on how drunk I’d like to get, but I never had that same ability with weed. And alcohol tastes better, and pairs better with most foods (although weed does make the sensory experience of food into something else…). Anyway, you can evaluate pros and cons if you want.

As of January 2019, nobody could convince me that touchscreens on a conventional laptop are of any use. Even the touch bar on my MacBook Pro is something that I use maybe once a week or so and only to change the volume level of the speakers (which could be perfectly done via physical buttons). There’s also a reason why the OS for touchscreen devices is built differently than a normal computer OS, fingers are not very accurate when touching a screen due to their thickness compared to the size of a mouse cursor. Applications with crowded menus are impossible to use because more often than not, you would miss the actual spot you intended to put your finger on, and trigger the wrong command. Therefore the larger buttons on tablets and smartphones, they were never intended for precision work. As others including Jobs have mentioned, an almost vertical touchscreen is an ergonomic nightmare, typing is impossible and other gestures can be done on the touchpad using perfectly normal hand positioning. On those devices where you can flip the screen around and make it tablet-like, maybe but so far no manufacturer has managed to do it right, not to mention that you end up with a much too heavy tablet for practical purposes.

Most satellites look like jet airliners at 30,000 feet except there are no flashing lights, just a continuous light like a slow to medium fast “moving star”. It’s fun to track them with a pair of binoculars but the main thing is you have to be able to track it. For that practice, you can do it by tracking jet airliners flying over your house at night. Most satellites don’t show much detail but I have seen the space shuttle departing the ISS one time and it was really cool to see the two dots separated by a little space while moving across the sky.

As recently as when I was a kid (50 years ago), each game ball was used until it got hit out of play (foul ball or home run), or until a pitcher requested a new one — in which case the ump put the old one in his handy ball pouch, then put it back in play the next time a “new” ball was needed. At the end of each half-inning, the last defensive player to touch the ball (usually the catcher if the third out was a strikeout, the first baseman if it was an infield ground-out, or an outfielder if a fly-out) would toss it back to the mound, where the opposing pitcher would pick it up and continue pitching with it, until a hitter batted it out of play. I don’t know precisely when that changed, but I know why — and it had a lot to do with pitchers scuffing and scratching and moistening and greasing and otherwise altering balls to make them move in unhittable ways. Pitchers used to conceal sandpaper and nail files and vaseline and other illegal tools and substances in their gloves or uniforms, precisely for that purpose. (A retired major league pitcher once told me that every spring, when he received a new Wilson glove, he replaced the red cloth behind the “W” logo with a piece of red sandpaper, and lots of other pitchers did too.) Replacing balls whenever they hit the ground, or are fouled back, or otherwise acquire any sort of scuffing accomplishes two things: (1) it eliminates any advantage to the pitcher that the scuffing might provide, and (2) it eliminates most pitcher cheating, since intentionally scuffing a ball that will only be in use for a few pitches isn’t worth the effort — or the risk. Not only are pitched balls replaced whenever they touch ground or a bat, but as the half-inning ends, the ball is carried to the dugout or tossed into the crowd by whoever has it (again, usually the catcher, first baseman, or an outfielder), rather than being thrown back to the mound, even if it hasn’t been scuffed, and the opposing pitcher gets a new ball. These days, the average life span of a major league baseball in game conditions is something like 3 pitches. As to why balls are not taken out of play after they are hit — usually they are. If you watch closely, you’ll see that the pitcher nearly always gets a new ball in those situations."},{"instruction":"anyone looking for a freight forwarder?","output":"They negotiate discounted rates on big amounts of space with maritime carriers.

However, there are a few factors to consider when using a microwave oven: nutrient loss, uneven heating, packaging concerns, and hot spots and burns. To minimize nutrient loss, it's best to use minimal amounts of water and cook for shorter periods. To ensure food is heated uniformly, it's important to stir or rotate it during the cooking process. To avoid hot spots and burns, it's important to stir and test the temperature of heated food or liquids before consuming. When using a microwave oven, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions, use microwave-safe containers, and practice safe food handling to minimize any potential health risks. Microwave ovens can have a positive impact on health, but it is important to use the right cookware and plastic containers and wraps. It is also important to read the labels of frozen or pre-packaged meals and choose options with healthier ingredients and lower levels of sodium. Additionally, it is important to balance microwave cooking with other cooking methods to maintain a varied and nutritious diet. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian if you have specific sensitivities or allergies to certain foods. Overall, using microwave ovens responsibly and in accordance with safety guidelines can provide a safe and convenient method of cooking or reheating food. Advantage: Microwave ovens offer several advantages, such as time-saving, energy-efficient, retention of nutrients, convenience and versatility, easy to use and clean, safety features, and uniform heating. Time-saving: Microwave ovens are designed to cook or heat food quickly, reducing cooking time compared to conventional methods. Energy-efficient: Microwave ovens are generally more energy-efficient than traditional cooking methods. Retention of nutrients: Microwave cooking can help retain heat-sensitive nutrients such as vitamin C and other water-soluble vitamins. Convenience and versatility: Microwave ovens are suitable for a wide range of cooking tasks, such as reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen food, cooking vegetables, making popcorn, and more. Easy to use and clean: Microwave ovens are user-friendly with simple controls and settings. Safety features: Modern microwave ovens are equipped with safety features such as child locks, timers, and automatic shut-off functions. Uniform heating: Microwave ovens can provide relatively uniform heating throughout the food, resulting in evenly cooked dishes. It is important to note that while microwave ovens offer several advantages, they should be used responsibly and in accordance Cons: Microwave ovens have several disadvantages, such as uneven heating, potential nutrient loss, limited browning and texture, and packaging concerns. Uneven heating can lead to burns if not properly accounted for. Nutrient loss can be minimized by using minimal amounts of water and cooking for shorter periods. Limited browning and texture can be achieved through additional cooking methods. Packaging concerns can be addressed by using microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic wrap that is not labeled as microwave-safe. Microwave ovens are generally safe when used properly, but there are some safety precautions to consider. For example, certain types of containers or materials not designated as microwave-safe can lead to melting, releasing harmful chemicals, or even causing fires. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and use caution when operating the microwave oven. By being aware of these potential drawbacks and using microwave ovens responsibly, people can mitigate risks and make the most of their convenience in the kitchen."},{"instruction":"w can we ensure that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers?","output":"Ensuring that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers involves addressing various factors and implementing effective mechanisms. Here are some considerations: 1. Transparent pricing mechanisms: Implement transparent pricing mechanisms that ensure fairness in determining the price of mangoes. This can include establishing market-based pricing systems, creating platforms for price discovery, and promoting open and competitive bidding processes. 2. Contract farming and written agreements: Encourage the use of written contracts between mango farmers and pulp industries. These contracts should clearly define the terms and conditions, including the quantity, quality requirements, pricing, payment terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Contract farming provides a structured framework that helps protect farmers' interests and ensures fair dealings. 3. Farmer organizations and cooperatives: Strengthen farmer organizations and cooperatives to collectively negotiate prices with pulp industries. Farmer collectives can enhance the bargaining power of mango farmers and enable them to secure better prices through collective marketing and negotiations. 4. Market information and capacity building: Provide mango farmers with access to market information, including price trends, demand forecasts, and processing industry requirements. This information empowers farmers to make informed decisions and negotiate fair prices. Capacity-building programs can also enhance farmers' understanding of market dynamics and improve their negotiation skills. 5. Government regulations and interventions: Governments can play a crucial role in ensuring fair pricing for mango farmers by enacting policies and regulations that protect their interests. This can include setting minimum support prices, regulating pulp industries to prevent unfair practices, and providing subsidies or incentives to support mango cultivation. 6. Quality standards and certification: Encourage mango farmers to adopt good agricultural practices and obtain quality certifications. Implementing quality standards helps ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their high-quality produce. Certifications such as organic or fair trade can provide additional value and differentiation, attracting buyers willing to pay premium prices. 7. Collaboration and dialogue: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between mango farmers, pulp industries, and relevant stakeholders. Engaging in open discussions and partnerships can help foster mutually beneficial relationships, address concerns, and find solutions that promote fair pricing practices. It is important to recognize that ensuring fair prices to mango farmers requires collective efforts from farmers, industry stakeholders, government bodies, and consumer awareness. Building transparent and equitable supply chains is essential for creating a fair and sustainable market for mango farmers."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Indeed, the harm brought about by the air ship affecting the towers — even at the high rate of speed they were voyaging — was not lethal to either tower. These structures were broadly planned and built to flex in solid powerful breezes or quakes, and even retain the effect of the biggest business air ship at the time which was a Boeing 707 four-motor traveler stream. You can't generally tell from accessible video or film, yet the underlying effect made the upper segment of the structures uproot 10– 20 feet from the focal point of gravity, and after that influenced back like a pendulum. Individuals who were up there and endure said it felt like they would overturn. So far the structures performed flawlessly, demonstration of the soundness of the designing and the redundancies in redistributing pressure loads. Things being what they are, the end result for cause complete disappointment? The flames is what occurred. Ok, please! Fly fuel doesn't consume sufficiently hot to soften steel. What's more, how could a bundle of paper and office furniture consume at such high temperatures? One needs to comprehend that heat makes steel grow and twist, and lose auxiliary quality. Think about a Japanese sword producer. He's warming that exceptionally hard steel over a basic carbon fire. The steel hasn't liquefied, however it has turned out to be mollified and moldable to the degree he can overlay it and sledge it, again and again. Typically, if a flame begins in an electrical storeroom, it will consume everything in that quick zone and afterward advancement to different regions. Overhead sprinkler frameworks and firemen will generally get things leveled out before it escapes hand. Be that as it may, on 9/11, those planes were filled for a cross-mainland flight. So right now of effect there was a deflagration of 10,000 gallons of fly fuel which touched off huge flames on 2 or 3 stories at the same time. This is path past the pale as far as reasonability by firemen even under the best of conditions. Be that as it may, for this situation we have the water channels which nourished the sprinkler framework disjoined. We have a lift framework rendered inoperable. What's more, we have a large number of individuals who should be cleared. This was grave. Alright, this is far up in the upper bits of the structure. How could those flames have influenced lower floors? What made them come up short? This is so. The flames had for all intents and purposes no effect on the lower 50 stories. The steel that was influenced by flame was the brackets and sections in the effect zone. For Truthers who question the seriousness of the flames, if it's not too much trouble clarify why such a significant number of individuals bounced to their demises from the region over the flames. Police helicopter film demonstrates the border sections on the floors of the effect zone bowing outward in the minutes prior to the breakdown. The steel that was holding up every one of the floors over this zone was preparing to clasp. Furthermore, clasp it did. This brought about a 25-story building falling 12 feet. That is a dynamic burden the floor beneath can't confront. Presently you have a 26-story building falling onto the following floor down, etc. Consider it tower of cards; you obliterate the whole segment of the 51st floor; the areas over them fall and include more weight harming the full structure and another floor goes down. It's a chain response; the main floors are the ones that take more time to disintegrate however it quickens as it gets more weight and energy from the fall. A fast aside: there is a vital contrast in building and material science between a \\"static\\" load and a \\"dynamic\\" load. For instance, when vehicles used to have hearty guards, Car A could get behind Car B and drive it forward and even push it onto the expressway and slowly accelerate to 90 mph. Generally, neither one of the cars will continue critical harm to their guards. This is a static burden. There is noteworthy power connected yet in a smooth manner. In a marginally unique situation Car B is stationary and Car An is going at 90 mph. Vehicle A chooses he's going to push Car B again at 90 mph. Be that as it may, this time the minute Car A reaches Car B there is a horrendous sound of crushing metal and the gas tank breaks and bursts into flames. This is a dynamic burden. Despite the fact that Car A can drive Car B up to 90mph, the second situation includes unexpected increasing speed. So with the WTC towers when everything is attached together legitimately, the lower floors bolster the heaviness of the upper floors. Be that as it may, when those upper floors experience a speeding up, presently you're taking a gander at a power the structure was not intended to deal with."},{"instruction":"w is the postgraduate hostel at AIIMS Bhubaneswar?","output":"The Postgraduate Hostels in AIIMS Bhubaneswar are Co-Ed except the PG Block for Msc & 4th Year Nursing.

Why we are use for construction?","output":"Cement is a fine mineral powder manufactured with very precise processes. Mixed with water, this powder transforms into a paste that binds and hardens when submerged in water. Because the composition and fineness of the powder may vary, cement has different properties depending upon its makeup. Cement is the main component of concrete. It's an economical, high-quality construction material used in construction projects worldwide. Cement is made by grinding together a mixture of limestone and clay, which is then heated at a temperature of 1,450°C. What results is a granular substance called \\"clinker,\\" a combination of calcium, silicate, alumina and iron oxide. Some of the reasons for its popularity in construction site. 01. Cement can be produced in large volumes in controlled condition, packed and transported. 02. Cement is a several times stronger binding material than lime and clay. 03. It can be mixed and used at will with locally available materials at site. 04. When stored properly in ordinary atmosphere it does not deteriorate for reasonably longer time (at least 3 to 4 month). 05. When mixed with water, starts setting and gain sufficient strength in a day or two, where as other binding materials require much longer time. Hence increase speed of construction. 06. It can withstand compressive stresses well. Where tension and shear stresses occurs it gives good bond to steel reinforcement and transfers excess stresses to steel. 07. It is produced from the materials like limestone, hematite, bauxite, clay, etc which are plentifully available in the upper crust of the earth. 08. It imparts strength and durability to building elements. Not only that with cement, the speed of construction also gets faster. 09. It is comparatively cheaper material.

Melisandre refers to stone dragon (or dragons) and believes she can wake one (or more) with rituals involving king’s blood. It’s also been prophesied that Azor Ahai will “wake dragons out of stone.” Melisandre believes in that prophecy, so that’s probably how she got the idea. In her words: I have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. And: The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious. From his king’s blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born. Apart from Melisandre, Shireen, Stannis’ daughter has also had dreams about stone dragons. She tells a maester: I had bad dreams. About the [stone] dragons. They were coming to eat me. There are basically three schools of thought about the stone dragons among fans. They are the dragon statues of Dragonstone. Those are the dragons Shireen refers to. To be honest, that doesn’t look like a very reasonable theory to me. Why would a statue come to life? It’s quite unprecedented and makes little sense.They are Daenerys’ dragons or other dragons born of petrified dragon eggs. It’s an obvious reference, but a valid one nonetheless. By the way, this is one of the basic arguments for those who think Daenerys is Azor Ahai reborn.Stone dragon(s) is a metaphor for a Targaryen living in obscurity, most probably Jon Snow. In dreams and visions, people are represented by animals and other symbols associated with their houses—Tullys are fish, Stark are wolves and Targaryens are dragons. If that’s the case, then Jon Snow is most probably Azor Ahai, and perhaps Shireen will get sacrificed to bring him back to life."},{"instruction":"w do I get the birth certificate for my child?","output":"PROCEDURE OF DELAYED BIRTH REGISTRATION STEP 1- Apply for non-availability certificate of birth where to contact - office of birth and death registrar Documents needed - DOB proof STEP 2- Apply for delayed birth registration order (from DM/SDM or any other first-class magistrate) Where to contact- office of DM/SDM or court Documents needed- 1-BIRTH REPORT, 2-NON AVAILABILITY CERTIFICATE, 3-AFFIDAVIT/SELF DECLARATION OF PARENTS, 4-AFFIDAVIT OF WITNESSES, 5-DOB PROOF, 6-ID/ADDRESS PROOF STEP 3- Apply for birth registration Where to contact - office of birth and death registrar documents needed - 1-DELAYED BIRTH REGISTRATION ORDER, 2-DOB PROOF, 3- ID/ADDRESS PROOF, 4-BIRTH REPORT STEP 4- After successful registration collect the birth certificate from the office of birth and death registrar or download from [LINKED_TEXT: Civil Registration System] [URL: http://www.crsorgi.gov.in/] [non-availability certificate→ delayed birth registration order → birth registration →birth certificate] For fee and other information see [LINKED_TEXT: RBD RULES] [URL: http://crsorgi.gov.in/web/uploads/download/Births_and_Deaths_Rules_1999.pdf]"},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"No!

Wouldn't a higher C turret allow all guns to fire forwards?","output":"A ship with three sequential superfiring turrets is indeed possible and was implemented on the British Dido-class and US Atlanta-class cruisers. Dido-class Atlanta-class The disadvantage of this arrangement is a higher centre of mass which decreases stability, especially in heavy seas. The Didos and Atlantas carried a 5.25” and 5” main armament respectively. These relatively light guns and light turret armour reduced the weight penalty of the superfiring turrets to within acceptable limits. The Nelson-class carried 16” guns (108 tons each as opposed to around 4.5 tons for the 5.25”) and the turrets and mounts were proportionately more heavily armoured. Three superfiring turrets were totally impractical. The Nelson-class were designed with three turrets forwards in an attempt to minimise the space (and weight) required by the armoured citadel in order to meet the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Nelson-class The result was the curious staggered arrangement seen above. Although this limited the Nelson-class to firing only six guns directly forward, it should be borne in mind firstly, that most previous battleships could only fire four guns directly forward and secondly, that at the time of the design it was still anticipated that battleships would fight in line of battle and thus be firing broadside rather than straight ahead. In light of these factors, the design compromise made for this class was not really a significant disadvantage."},{"instruction":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

None of my friends would ride with me. It took a long time and a lot of patience, but I was able to get most of his misbehavior under control. He and I often walked in the redwoods on a favorite trail. But I sprained my ankle and Henry hadn’t been walked for a month. I was looking forward to getting back out there one afternoon but I had a lot of errands so we didn’t arrive at the trailhead until close to 5pm. It didn’t matter. Police tape had closed the trail. A woman runner had been badly beaten and raped. Unnerved, I called Henry’s trainer to ask whether Henry could be trained to protect me. The trainer said teaching a seventy pound biting poodle to bite wasn’t a good idea. He had a four month old German Shepherd puppy, descended from a line of Schutzhund champions. Her litter mates had been sold two months before but Jessie, as she was named, was an alpha and he wasn’t selling her to anyone who wouldn’t keep her under control. Because of my work with Henry, he believed I would be a good owner for her. I went to see her, expecting the image of a noble German Shepherd. The dog who bounded down their steps toward me was a mop of long fur and clumsy puppyness. Matt, the trainer, suggested I take her to the beach and get to know her. I plopped her in the backseat of my car and drove to the beach. There I found a stick and we played fetch for several minutes. The beach was deserted but suddenly Jessie dropped her stick and ran to me, sitting down beside me, her focus on a man coming toward us. She didn’t move, growl, bark or in any way threaten him, but she sat close to me with her eyes pinned on this stranger. He came up and spoke to me about the puppy, noting she seemed like an excellent dog. Then he went on his way. As soon as he did, Jessie ran back to her stick and we resumed the game. I reached down and kissed the top of her head. “You’re my dog now,” I said. A year later, we were doing protection training (not because she needed to learn to protect me but because she needed to be trained to stop protecting me when I said to), and a woman volunteered to play the “bad guy.” She yelled at me, waved her arms and acted like she hated me. I told Jessie to “attack”. She just looked at me, and I could see what she was thinking. Jessie was brilliant. “It’s only a woman,” she would’ve said if she’d been able to speak. The trainer handed the woman a styrofoam bat and she proceeded toward me with it raised. At that point, Jessie attacked. She was the most beautiful German Shepherd I’ve ever seen and her alpha posture was something to behold. She never attacked another dog, completely ignored little yapping guys that imagined they could take on an 85-pound Shepherd, and was loving with anybody she trusted, and she trusted most people. On the trail, more than once we came around a bend to find a dog flattened on the ground, its owner yelling, “Get up! What’s wrong with you?” As soon as we passed, the dog would jump up and run on. Toward the end of her life, Jessie’s back legs gave out and she was in a wheelchair. However, just before that, she’d been confined to the downstairs, of course, because she couldn’t mount the steps. But a workman came to discuss some work in the upstairs with me. As we talked, I suddenly heard her trying to get upstairs. I ran to stop her, but too late, she’d made it most of the way but then slid all the way to the bottom. Clearly, she didn’t want me unprotected with a strange man. She died st thirteen, a victim of horrible hip dysplasia and degenerative myelopathy of the spine. I lost her nine years ago but to this day I weep over her. I have wonderful dogs now, two German shepherds and a Havanese, but I’ll never see the likes of Jessie again. She was the exemplar of the breed: intense, courageous, intelligent, and loyal. I have no doubt she would’ve risked her life to save mine. Because of Jessie, as long as I live, I’ll always own a shepherd."},{"instruction":"Which New Testament verses clearly support the conservative Christian political position insisting capitalism as the only acceptable political economy in the United States?","output":"None whatsoever.

Their villians are not dark reflections of themselves (as, for example, Batman and Joker). Their villains represent competing ideologies. The X-Men are an entirely ideological organization. It is made up of people who believe in Xavier's dream: that peaceful coexistence is both possible and makes us stronger. They are basically hippies running a commune. All these people? Well they all have different ideologies. Competing ideologies. And the X-Men's fights are just visual metaphors for debate. Apocalypse believes in social darwinism. Mr. Sinister believes in eugenics. Mojo believes in violence as entertainment. The Hellfire Club believes in unfettered capitalism. The Sentinels represent fascism. The Brotherhood of Mutants represent various terrorist ideologies. And Magneto, well Magneto represents separatism and supremacy in relation to the X-Men's belief in integration and egalitarianism. From Magneto's point of view, the Nazis will always come. Always. And “never again” means being strong enough to make sure that it never happens again. And in one of the most controversial elements of the X-Men, they make it clear that Magneto is right. We have seen enough death and destruction wrought by the Sentinels to know Magneto's beliefs are pretty grounded in a realistic worldview. The X-Men are operating entirely on faith. On the faith that humanity has a better nature. That every stumble will result in a rise. So why isn't Magneto strictly a villain? While Magneto has some degree of ego, and has done some some terrible things… what he does isn't for selfish reasons. It isn't doing it for greed. He isn't Doctor Doom trying to take over the world just because he has a massive ego. He doesn't care about vengeance. He is not a psychopath. Magneto has a specific view on human nature, and everything he does is based on an entirely logical course of action given that belief. Magneto genuinely wants to save his people. Magneto saw his people die, his family die, once and is determined to prevent that from happening again. And given that we have seen Sentinels kill 16 million mutants in the span of minutes, his concerns and approach are quite valid. As with all the X-Men villains, all it takes to turn them into heroes is a conversation. Simply persuading them that Xavier's way is better. This is about ideology. And it is why the X-Men are so astoundingly successful at rehabilitation. When the X-Men make a case that their point of view is better than his, Magneto becomes a hero. When he becomes disillusioned with their idealism and blind faith he goes back to being a villain. It is pretty simple."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"There are several ways to make money online without an initial investment in 2023: Freelancing: Offer your skills on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr.Content Creation: Start a blog, YouTube channel, or podcast and monetize through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.Online Surveys and Microtasks: Participate in online surveys or complete small tasks on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk.Online Tutoring or Teaching: Share your expertise through online tutoring or teaching platforms like VIPKid or Teachable.Virtual Assistance: Provide administrative support, social media management, or customer service remotely.Remote Work: Search for remote job opportunities on websites like [LINKED_TEXT: http://Remote.co] [URL: http://remote.co/] or We Work Remotely.Selling Crafts or Products: Sell handmade crafts or products on platforms like Etsy or eBay.Writing and Publishing: Write and self-publish eBooks or articles on platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing or Medium.Stock Photography: Sell your photos on stock photography websites like Shutterstock or Adobe Stock.Online Gigs: Offer services like graphic design, digital marketing, or writing on platforms like Fiverr or TaskRabbit.

We were going to see escape room, but we had to settle for the dog movie, which was ok with us, because Escape Room was sold out. When we entered the movie, there was a lot of empty seats. Keep in mind that this is a movie theatre where you pick your seats in advance. We went to our seats and a group of teenagers were in them. Me (20) my boyfriend (24) and my best friend (18) decided that it didn’t really matter where we sat, so we sat in front of them. This was a HUGE MISTAKE! They spent the entire movie talking, laughing (this movie was sad!!!) , screaming and playing on their phones; they even proceeded to drop their phones several times. By the end of the movie my group and I were so annoyed as we weren’t able to enjoy it since these young adults were so inconsiderate! It baffles me how children are being raised these days as my parents have always taught me to be considerate of others; especially in public places such as the movie theatre, which people pay to attend."},{"instruction":"w can I reach the mark of 20 LPA plus salary starting as a fresher with 6 LPA salary initially as a software engineer?","output":"First Be patient. Dont be so desparate. Keep researching on what all skills you are lacking and try to acquire the same. Try to get all the missing skills and knowledge in your current employment. After 4 years in current role, you could have reached 8 LPA and you can make a move then to reach 12 LPA. With another 5 years in that role you can reach 18 LPA. After that you can shift again to reach 24 LPA. Hence minimum of 9 years will pass compulsorily. There are many people with 10 to 15 years experience who have not yet reached 20 LPA. So dont fret it out at this young age without any experience. Be patient and keep learning / spend at least 20% of your earnings in education. Only then you can move faster to senior roles and increase your earnings."},{"instruction":"Can a squirrel scratch give you rabies?","output":"No. Even a substantial bite from a squirrel won't transmit rabies."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to start learning PHP?","output":"Join [LINKED_TEXT: WaterFlame Training Institute,Bhubaneswar,Orissa] [URL: http://waterflame.in/] PHP online course"},{"instruction":"w fast could the US Air Force SR71 Blackbird fly if it pushed its engines to the point of destruction as some MiG25 Foxbats did chasing the Blackbird?","output":"If I told you then we would both probably “disappear.”"},{"instruction":"Can stress damage your brain?","output":"Stress can affect a person’s health and mind in many ways.

The result is that your document is significantly better than it would be otherwise when it arrives with your editor. This means that they can make better use of their time looking for things that computers can't find like issues with your plot, factual mistakes, and issues with your structure and argument. The result of using a grammar checker before sending your text to an editor will be a significantly better result.
