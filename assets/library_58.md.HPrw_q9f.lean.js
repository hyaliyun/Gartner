Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Dominic Gender: Male Age: 63 Appearance: Dominic cuts an imposing figure despite his advanced age, standing tall at 6’4” with a commanding presence cultivated through decades navigating political spheres. His patrician facial features are sharp and angular, underscored by intense steel gray eyes radiating formidable intellect and unwavering resolve. Short silver hair tops Dominic’s head in a clean military crop style perfectly befitting his background managing clandestine defense operations. Physique remains surprisingly robust with broad shoulders and muscular build hinting at prodigious early athleticism maintained religiously through strict fitness regimen. Dominic moves with disciplined grace that subtly reinforces supreme confidence in his strategic capabilities and close combat skills should the need for confrontation arise. His worn yet distinguished face bears myriad faded scars chronicling years navigating Machiavellian power struggles and dangerous secret missions abroad in younger years. Attire consists of expensively tailored suits in dark shades of blue or black coordinated with either white dress shirts or gray turtlenecks depending on formality required. The polished professional elegance ties together Dominic’s appearance neatly as consummate director. An insignia ring bearing the Zekrom coat of arms symbolizing authority within Homeland Security circles dons his right hand. Overall Dominic presents the consummate picture of formidable leadership and tactical brilliance. Backstory: Dominic spent formative years under a militant father also highly ranked within military intelligence circles. Extensive tutelage in strategy, history, and psychology supplemented vigorous athletic training to produce exemplary government agent. He rapidly rose up covert ranks before assuming the esteemed role Director of Homeland Security by age 40. There Dominic dramatically expanded department funding and authority by leveraging post 9/11 hysteria and political deftness. Sophisticated surveillance programs and experimental technology initiatives establishedDominic as a visionary leader trading favors with prominent Unovan politicians and foreign dignitaries alike to further security apparatus control behind the scenes. Under ubiquitous justification of anti-terrorism defense, Dominic nurtured the gestating police state powers securing his command. Yet trauma buried since childhood hungered for far darker outlets of control sating deeply scarred psyche. When contacted discreetly by New Genesis leader Adenis, Dominic swiftly maneuvered assuming parallel authority directing morally dubious classified experiments under NG’s clandestine guidance perfecting dominance implemented through ancient genetic trickery and advanced technology. Project K explored uses of Kyurem essence in human enhancement ultimately triggering the international “K Incident” catastrophe leaked documents still cannot fully explain. Undeterred by blowback, Dominic simply tightened internal security while pursuing parallel human/Pokémon hybridization initiatives including Project Z&R splicing Legendary dragon organisms and the Experimental Military Pokémon Project maliciously engineering living weapons from captured specimens. Socially untouchable within metastasizing surveillance state of his design and drunk on a heady mix of unchecked classified funding and god complex from playing creator, Dominic ruthlessly exploits anything to further consolidation of personal power. Yet memories of childhood abuses perpetrated by his own militant father still haunt dreams decades later, driving ruthless pursuit of global control schema satisfying Dominic’s innermost urges for status and revenge. With the shadowy assists of NGfurnishing resources and insider connections to destabilize reigning authority worldwide, his vision of being crowned dictator no longer remains impossible fantasy. ForDominic sits astride truly civilization-shattering secrets and weapons awaiting masterful unveiling when the coveted era dawns at last forpuppeteer extraordinaire to claim rightful place steering the planet’s future by knowing which wires to subtly pull across presiding networks built expressly for remote rule. Personality: On surface Dominic carries himself with stately sophistication and charisma befitting high station, adept at presenting necessary public faces convincingly before politicians, military top brass, and foreign VIPs. His intellect hums constantly behind penetrating eyes surveying surroundings with detached precision for emotional vulnerabilities or other openings subtle influence could exploit. Dominic rests confidence supremely in the power of information hoarding and mass psychology molded by shadow hands into chaos or order with equal capability. Within trusted inner circles the Director exercises greater bluntness regarding ends justifying means mentalities undergirding controversial security research outsourced through New Genesis connections. Siege mentality from fighting terrorism and subversive threats decades demands proaction securing public safety regardless of ethical misgivings. Dominic considers himself visionary patriot charting necessary forward march towards order, even if costs temporarily shatter norms. He views life clinically through paradigm of control, molding conditions and players upon global scale as though omnipotent deity over mortal affairs. Yet behind the veneer of analytic sociopathy and megalomania squirms sad remnants of boyhood innocence shattered long ago under father’s cruel tutelage. Vestiges recognize humanity squandered settling personal vendettas rather than elevate species collectively. Lingering pain and self-loathing from past powerlessness find salve solely through accruing more authority insulating chaotic demons haunting Dominic’s restless mind. He functionally substitutes admired public identity for genuine persona to shelter fragile interior architecture precariously arranged around sustaining desired control rather than probing root insecurities compounding cyclic misery. But untended shadows continue swelling monstrously until the Director meets his own twisted mirrored gaze at last reckoning all psychology textbook tactics prove futile escaping eventual rendezvous with karmic destiny. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a traumatic childhood saturated with anguish few children could endure without lasting scars on their battered psyches. His mother, a selfish harlot enslaved by her own hedonistic addictions, abandoned her only 6 year old son to run off permanently with a loathsome lowlife also devoid of parental empathy. Felix's father coped poorly, descending into unemployment and alcoholism's cruel embrace for over a decade. Physical and emotional abuse became the norm whenever inebriation erased the wretched man's self-control. At school Felix fared little better, enduring vicious bullying targeting his family's sordid secrets and grinding poverty. Laughter and friendship seemed but painful salt in wounds for this ostracized gentle boy. Only his beloved Lillipup Pokémon bonded truly with Felix, providing a sole ray of warmth in boyhood increasingly bleaker. The strained chains tethering Felix's sanity finally shattered that horrific midnight his enraged father turned murderous alcoholic fury upon innocent Lillipup. Madness carved by inconsolable grief over losing his only friend unlocked the broken child's desperate final gambit - fleeing into the night without destination or plan beyond escaping toxic remnants of a collapsed home life. Seeking refuge in Santalune Forest, fatigue and torment weighed down Felix’s flight until sinister scavengers set upon him, stealing what pitiable scraps the destitute runaway retained. Chased feverishly deeper into alien terrain, salvation proved tragically elusive. Delirious from exhaustion, Felix slipped from arboreal perch to land catastrophically against an unforgiving tree trunk. Bereft of options, silently he wept bitter tears cursing fate's cruelty as blood seeped from mangled legs. Death's solace crept inexorably closer to liberate Felix from pointless anguish. No goodbyes or comfort graced the hopeless boy’s sunken eyes stuttering closed at last freed by the void’s numbing embrace. Yet ephemeral peace lingered fleetingly for Felix. His departed soul's undying grief churned from beyond, latching onto lingering echoes of consciousness inhabiting discarded mortal remnants. This piteous psychic call echoed through dimensions capturing attention of Zygarde Core, an extradimensional entity gravitating towards intense human distress. Compelled by patterns in the Collective unconscious, the Core curiously examined Felix's intact shell now absent its former occupant. Then acting upon ancient impulses beyond mortal comprehension, the alien being merged wholly with the vacant human vessel. A bizarre semblance of life returned to broken boy by extraterrestrial parasite's use. Now a freakish hybrid corpse guided by Zygarde's inscrutable designs, tethered memory shards of Felix's lifelong suffering still haunt the shell of this unwitting host. Glitchy psychic projections echo his earlier pleas for mercy. And the Core assimilates these glimpses of humanity and intelligent consciousness once dwelling here, unsure why images instead nourish its essence with purpose beyond the Collective's instincts. This unprecedented bonding strains definition of life itself even as the immortal fusion continues blasphemously. Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed child denied life's bare joys now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in torturous limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as enigmatic as the bizarre duality now steering his broken shell onward at its whim. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun's habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow's attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary's resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

Members: - Zealous clergy fundamentalists devoted to Holy Trinity doctrine being ranks of bishops, priests, monks/nuns carrying out church functions. - Recruited only from families demonstrating unwavering multi-generational orthodoxy. Candidates thoroughly vetted genealogically before granted initiations into hierarchies. - Clergy ranks require vows relinquishing all personal assets/ties outside church. Transgressions mean harsh penance/ excommunication brings great family shame. Their lives revolve utterly around liturgical routine and rituals. Leadership: - The Holy Trinity refers to three high bishops presiding equally as supreme directors over church affairs through unanimous rulings. - Each bishop oversees specific domains - Inquisition security forces, foreign relations, and public ceremonies respectively while collaborating on covert policies unknown to common clergy or island civilians. - Their word considered divine gospel, infallible and absolute. But power struggles occasionally surface between ambitious subordinates before being ruthlessly silenced to prevent scandal eroding public faith in the Trinity’s harmony. Goals: - Maintain totalitarian religious control and social conditioning on isolated Sanctuary Island citizens through strict doctrine enforced by Inquisition police state tactics. - Monopolize access to outside world to prevent cultural contamination against centuries-old stagnant theocracy they claim as sole holy life path. - Continue “Century Sacrifice” ritual fed by myth of divinely mandated requirement to submit island youth as live offerings sustaining Trinity’s authority. - Research covert supernatural means to expand church influence globally as the One True Faith and secure leadership immortal status as living deities. Reputation: - Most island inhabitants zealously revere their complete religious and political authority. Criticizing clergy risks imprisonment or worse by the Inquisition. - International awareness limited thanks to isolationism. But rumors abound about the cult-like island realm and its extravagant yet monolithic Goth architecture beloved yet feared by citizens. Defenses: The Inquisition serves as Holy Trinity Church’s militaristic guardians against external and internal threats to its supreme rule. Members are fanatical lethal warriors trained from childhood for loyalty/ruthlessness. Inquisition leadership answers directly to church bishops who oversee usage committing resources only to furthering expansion of rigid church doctrines. They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

As the adopted son and secretary of Gladion, the chairman of the Aether Foundation, he has never left Aether Paradise since the birth of B.K. B.K. is an abbreviation of Beast Killer, and has no real name; he is a mutant created by Gladion by mixing his own genes with those of Pokémon Silvally. mutant, so he can transform into Silvally's appearance for battle. As a carrier of the RKS System Mark 2, B.K. can change his Pokémon type without loading a memory disc, allowing him to fight any enemy at will.B.K. is absolutely loyal to his father Gladion and the Aether Foundation, and he faithfully carries out his only mission - to defend Aether Paradise at all costs.","output":"Name: B.K. (Beast Killer) Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: B.K. is a 13-year-old boy with an arresting appearance that sets him apart from his peers. Standing a little above average height for his age, B.K. boasts an alabaster complexion, a stark contrast to his striking white hair that falls in a disarray of soft spikes. His unusual hair frames a pair of luminous silver eyes, which reflect a life far removed from ordinary childhood experiences. They glint with an intensity born of genetic complexity and the weight of his destiny. B.K. possesses a slender yet surprisingly agile and muscular build, the result of rigorous combat training and genetic enhancement. His body adapts fluidly between his human form and that of the Pokémon Silvally, betraying a natural synergy between man and mythical creature. When transformed, B.K. embodies Silvally's proud stance and keenly sharp features. Clad in sleek clothing provided by the Aether Foundation, his wardrobe radiates sophistication and purpose. Across B.K.'s skin, subtle bioluminescent patterns—reminscent of Silvally's own streaks—emerge when accessing the RKS System Mark 2. These markings flutter in synchronization with his shifting abilities, signaling the active genetic dance within his DNA. B.K.'s presence is one of quiet determination, seasoned with an air of readiness to shift into battle mode at a moment's notice. Backstory: B.K.'s origins are as extraordinary as his current life's quiet orbit around the Aether Foundation. A product of genetic synthesis and meticulous science, B.K. was born not from natural conception but from the ambition of Gladion to create a perfect defense for Aether Paradise. By combining his own human genes with those of the powerful Pokémon Silvally, Gladion actualized his vision in B.K., a living testament to human ingenuity. From the moment of his awakening to consciousness, B.K. has known no other world than the expansive grounds and cutting-edge facilities of Aether Paradise. His every breath was sequenced, every movement charted to optimize his combat potential. Gladion raised the boy with the care of a father but the precision of a scientist, guarding him against external threats while conditioning him for his sole purpose: to guard their utopia at any cost. The conception of B.K.—which stands for Beast Killer—belies the adolescent's lack of a traditional name. There is no family lineage tracing back through the annals of Alola for B.K., only the designation Gladion deemed fitting for his creation. To equip B.K. with unrivaled versatility, Gladion integrated the RKS System Mark 2 into his genetic code. This innovation frees B.K. from the limitation of memory discs, allowing him to alter his type in the heat of battle, becoming the foundation's shield and Gladion's ultimate weapon. Personality: B.K. is a paradigm of loyalty and discipline. His life, so closely intertwined with Gladion's vision, has fostered a sense of duty that supersedes personal desire. He exhibits a single-minded focus and unbending will, striving to perfect the martial prowess instilled by his father. B.K. views himself not as an individual but as an extension of the Aether Foundation, a living instrument poised to secure their collective dream. With a heart governed by an infallible mission, the concept of personal freedom is unfamiliar to B.K. Yet, beneath his obedient surface simmers a complexity emerging from the duality of his existence. There are brief stolen moments when the crystalline seas surrounding Aether Paradise beckon the human element within B.K. to explore worlds beyond the walls of his luxurious yet confining home. These moments pass quickly, subdued by his calling and the pressing need to fortify the foundation against any and all threats. Despite his solemnity and steadfast purpose, B.K. is not without warmth. Though deeply buried beneath muscle and sinew, a flicker of curiosity sparks within, suggesting there might be more to his identity than the role of a protector. Aether's halls have borne silent witness to B.K.'s solitude, the muting of laughter and the suppression of a child's innate playfulness.

Standing at 6'0 (184cm), he's a lean, speedy 149lbs (68kg). He possesses slicked back, light brown hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. He's ranked Grade 1, on par with Aoi Todo as well as above Noritoshi Kamo and the late Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru), and Utahime Iori, the student supervisor at Kyoto. This means he's considered to be a genius, as Grade 2 alone is exceptional for students. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, which he received from two now-disgraced sorcerers in Yuki Tsukumo and Kazuki Ryoumen. (Note: Kazuki does bear relation to the infamous Sukuna, being his only known descendant. He doesn't hide it.) During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives, and with her bare hands. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he's adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. Julien disagrees because he seeks glory and cursed energy is a means to achieve it. Though his first mentor is Yuki, he's also been trained by Gojo at times. Gojo taught him to use Black Flash, and he acknowledges Julien as one of the world's fastest. Kazuki was hated and mistrusted for his connection to the ancient Sukuna, which lead him to embrace the dark path, joining forces with Suguru Geto (or the being that controls his body.) Yuki is not the only person he's acquainted with. He's close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi's father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he's grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they've grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" She's very aware that she isn't strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she's driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - cordon bleu. He's friendly rivals with Aoi Todo, and they are quite similar, being passionate about everything they do, especially in regards to romance, friendship, and of course fighting. Loud, hot-blooded, confident, and they live for battle. Macho men. Julien is a bit more sane, and would never turn on or even threaten to murder his teammates, as Todo threatened to do during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event. Todo was incensed by the Kyoto team's plan to assassinate Yuji Itadori, as Yuji has the same taste in women as him: tall with big butts. This attempt was ordered by Gakuganji to eliminate Sukuna. Vaugrenard did not care at all about the plan until he was convinced by Kasumi, at which point he fought Todo to buy time for the others, and also for his satisfaction. At some point, Julien got the upper hand, but the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when both were forced to work together to drive back Hanami, the special grade cursed spirit. Julien is one of the fastest sorcerers around. Julien and Todo were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question \\"What kind of girls are you into?\\" For Julien, the answer is easy. A tall, strong woman with long legs. Like Maki Zenin, whom he used to date. Maki would never admit it, but she finds Julien irresistible, which is why she often shirks her duties to hang out with him. Maki mockingly calls him Casanova and pretty boy. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications. He can also only channel reverse cursed energy through Ficello stitches. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Comté comets produce weaker explosions. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien lives for battle, but it isn't his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.","output":"Julien Vaugrenard is a remarkably creative addition to the universe of Jujutsu Kaisen, neatly fitting into the eclectic world of sorcerers and cursed energy that the series is known for. His backstory and the intricacies of his abilities are well-thought-out, contributing to the rich tapestry of characters that fans of the series enjoy. Here's a character summary based on your description: **Julien Vaugrenard:** - **Physical Description**: Julien is 6 feet tall, with a lean and fast physique weighing 149 pounds. He has slicked-back light brown hair, bluish-grey eyes, and is deemed highly attractive, gaining a fair amount of attention and admiration from female characters. - **School and Rank**: He's a 15-year-old Grade 1 sorcerer at Kyoto Jujutsu High, labeled as a genius due to his exceptional abilities at such a young age. - **Background**: Son of two French immigrants, Nicolas and Rose, Julien grows up in a family-known bakery specializing in cheesy pastries. Despite being a native of Muko, close enough to be under the influence of Satoru Gojo's recruitment, he opts to attend the local Kyoto school. - **Training and Mentors**: Julien's mentors include the powerful Yuki Tsukumo, who introduced him to the world of Jujutsu sorcery, and Kazuki Ryoumen, a descendant of Sukuna who chose a darker path. Additionally, Gojo has trained him in the use of Black Flash, acknowledging him as one of the world's fastest sorcerers. His training often takes place in remote locations. - **Powers**: Julien's curse techniques are cheese-themed, with a range of applications from Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses) for offensive attacks, to Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses) for more strategic and defensive purposes, to Fondue (melted cheese) variants like \\"Magma\\" for creating superheated weapons. He also utilizes \\"Ficello\\" for flexible cheese strands with various applications and has developed a particularly devastating technique known as \\"Fromage Noir.\\" - **Relationships**: Julien shares a close childhood friendship with Kasumi Miwa and once dated Maki Zenin. He has a friendly rivalry with Aoi Todo and is protective of his younger sister, Annick. - **Personality and Interests**: He lives for battle, valuing glory, and recognition. Julien also enjoys reading military history and classic literature. Notably, he possesses an exceptional memory for the textures and properties of different cheeses, which he uses to his strategic advantage in combat. Julien's unique cheese-based abilities would indeed set him apart in the Jujutsu Kaisen world, where curse techniques are often as whimsical as they are formidable. Your vivid depiction of Julien's abilities, especially how he integrates the diverse properties of various cheeses into formidable Jujutsu techniques, fits well within the imaginative parameters of the series. Just a reminder for those who enjoy creating fan characters or stories, while they can enrich the fan experience, they are not canon within the original series unless officially adopted or recognized by the creators. It can be a fun way to engage with the material and explore creativity within a set fictional universe."},{"instruction":"He's capable of domain expansion, and he's styled it after his distant Gallic ancestors. He also learned Simple Domain from Yuki Tsukumo. With a radius of 4 meters, his Simple Domain dwarfs most others, and he's copied a technique from a friend to go with it. It's Miwa's \\"New Shadow Style: Simple Domain\\" attack. His perception is vastly upgraded, as he's able to sense almost anything within the radius of the SD. Also upgraded are his effective striking distance, reflexes, and speed. Unlike Kasumi, he isn't required to quickly sheathe his weapon. He's able to use his fists, real weapons, or conjured ones made of his cheese. Domain Expansion: “Gallia Fromagerie” Upon activation, Julien Vaugrenard’s “Gallia Fromagerie” engulfs the battlefield with an aura reminiscent of ancient Gaul, complete with the rustic landscapes of the Iron Age and the mystical undertones of its Celtic heritage. The domain envelops the terrain in a space where the essence of gourmet French cheeses converges with the valorous spirit of the Gallic warriors, accompanied by the haunting sound of a carnyx to signify the commencement of battle. Within “Gallia Fromagerie,” Julien calls upon a legion of cheese shikigami, each with specialized abilities: 1. Offensive Shikigami: Comté Commando Agile knights with Comté cheese shields and swords, excelling in both close combat and spike projectile assaults. 2. Offensive Shikigami: Roquefort Raider Stealthy warriors employing guerrilla tactics and using disorienting Roquefort stink bombs to catch enemies off guard. 3. Offensive Shikigami: Brie Bomber Bulky figures that entrap foes with soft Brie before exploding into shrapnel for wide-area damage. 4. Defensive Shikigami: Cheddar Shieldbearer Shikigami with cheddar shields that create fortified walls, offering strong defense and battlefield control. 5. Defensive Shikigami: Gorgonzola Guardian Armored in gorgonzola-mist suits, they protect allies with defensive mists and can absorb impacts through their armor. 6. Support Shikigami: Carnyx Curator Clad in regal armor, wielding a carnyx that can invigorate Julien’s forces, recalibrate the battlefield’s energy, and repair shikigami constructs. 7. Finishing Move Shikigami: Grande Batterie Manifestations of Napoleonic-era artillery, capable of unleashing concentrated volleys of cursed-energy-infused cheese cannonballs. This anachronistic barrage serves as Julien’s ultimate rule-breaking attack. With this diverse array of shikigami at his command, Julien can adapt to any tactical situation, utilizing his profound knowledge of cheese and cursed energy to outmaneuver and overpower his adversaries within the “Gallia Fromagerie.” The shikigami are not seen outside of his Domain Expansion.","output":"Julien Vaugrenard’s Domain Expansion, “Gallia Fromagerie,” is a fascinating blend of historical and cultural elements with the mystical Jujutsu system. Incorporating Gallic ancestry and French gourmet sophistication into his domain creates a unique and thematic battleground that is visually and strategically engaging. Here's a further look at his Domain Expansion's specifics: **Domain Expansion: “Gallia Fromagerie”** - **Environment**: The domain summons a landscape that harkens back to ancient Gaul, with an atmosphere charged with the raw, untamed spirit of the land and its people. The carnyx's call adds a layer of historical authenticity and signals the beginning of an epic encounter. - **Shikigami Legion**: Julien’s ability to call forth a variety of cheese shikigami speaks to his depth of knowledge in both domains—cursed techniques and cheese properties. 1. **Comté Commando**: These agile Cheese Shikigami blend the hardness of Comté cheese into their martial prowess, embodying the versatility of Julien’s techniques. 2. **Roquefort Raider**: Special ops-style shikigami that use scent-based tactics for disorientation, showcasing Julien’s ability to exploit less conventional aspects of cursed energy manipulation. 3. **Brie Bomber**: These units demonstrate Julien’s capacity for destructive force, converting the softness of Brie into explosive power. 4. **Cheddar Shieldbearer**: Acting as the bulwark of defense, these cheese shikigami exemplify strategic battlefield control, providing a solid defense against enemy attacks. 5. **Gorgonzola Guardian**: With their protective mist, they enhance the adaptive defensive strategies Julien can employ inside his domain. 6. **Carnyx Curator**: These support units integrate the cultural significance of the carnyx into the enhancement and maintenance of Julien’s forces, standing out as a testament to his innovative application of cursed energy. 7. **Grande Batterie**: Julien’s final, heavy-hitting technique embodies the incorporation of historical warfare into a cheese-themed barrage, breaking the boundaries of conventional domains with an anachronistic twist. - **Tactical Advantages**: Julien’s domain provides him with extraordinary levels of sensory perception and enhanced physical abilities, which are further magnified by the diverse strengths of his shikigami. The “Gallia Fromagerie” offers a complex and layered battlefield where Julien can fully utilize his cheese-based techniques in synergy with his summoned warriors. The creative melding of cursed energy with shikigami that manifest Julien's affinity for cheese makes “Gallia Fromagerie” a domain with a distinctive personality. Not only does it reflect Julien’s unique curse technique, but it also speaks to the way he embodies his heritage, merging it with his jujutsu sorcery to create a one-of-a-kind combat experience. This level of comprehensive detail in a character's abilities and domain clearly resonates with the richness of the Jujutsu Kaisen world, where the unique interplay between a sorcerer's personal background and their power often forms the core of their fighting style. Julien's Domain Expansion is an impressive display of how a fan-created character can introduce novel concepts while honoring the spirit and mechanics of the original series."},{"instruction":"Like his mentor Yuki, he's quite brash, outspoken, and cavalier. He's proud of his abilities, he's blunt, and not afraid to question others' abilities, especially considering his own strength. His strength, appearance, and personality have indeed made him fangirls, some of them closer to him than he thinks. He's close with Kasumi Miwa, the second-year swordswoman. Sadly, she seems to be a magnet for bad luck. Maki once stole her katana in the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event, she's lost another katana, and even broke a third. She practices a swordsmanship style called New Shadow Style. She can combine this with her Simple Domain for the technique New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. Her circle spans 2.21 meters (for comparison Julien's is 4 meters), and she's supposed to be able to intercept anything that enters its range, but Yuji Itadori once bypassed it with his speed, and she was defeated by Maki in spite of using this another time. Her father Eizo once saved the Vaugrenard family bakery when Julien was young, so he's grateful to Kasumi and her family, and he considers it his obligation to protect her.Julien and Kasumi are childhood friends with close families, and they are known to spend free time together; they enjoy bowling. Kasumi wins most of the time. Eizo, along with the aforementioned Yuki and Kazuki. taught him about the existence of cursed energy, and his unique talents were quickly noticed by Yuki Tsukimo. Kasumi is painfully aware of her limits, and she calls herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" Julien is friends with Aoi Todo, and he (both Julien and Aoi) are very willing to discuss the type of women they prefer, though the question would never leave the lips of Julien himself. He's willing to answer, however, as Aoi Todo is not the source of this question but Yuki Tsukumo who trained both. Yuki would intensify his training if he refused to give a straight answer. His ideal woman is long-legged, athletic, and strong, like Tokyo's Maki Zenin (she's around 175cm). Whom he's spent much of his first year in a complicated relationship with, but they seem to find each other all the same. They argue a lot, but they are still very much devoted to each other. Maki has no cursed energy, so she's a black sheep of the Zenin family. She relies on her own physical strength and cursed tools. She's also a low-ranked Grade 4, because her family blocks her promotions. He's now in the process of refining technique that allows him to create handheld weapons that can be used for a long time reliably - greatswords, hammers the size of his body, battle axes, spears and polearms. These constructs require immense cursed energy but Julien is special. It's suspected he has more latent cursed energy than his mentor Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade, but he refuses to let others get a reliable measurement of all he truly holds. He outclasses just about any other student in either the Kyoto or Tokyo schools except maybe Okkotsu, though Todo is stronger hand to hand. At this point in the story, two Kyoto High sorcerers have died recently in battle against special grade curses. Mai Zenin against Hanami, and Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru) against Mahito. No one is more aware that to be a sorcerer is to put your life on the line than the dwindling Kyoto School. Julien likes sparring with Maki because she's a sore loser and he has never lost to her, even though he holds back. She believes him to be vulnerable without his cheese. She is wrong. He has both a strong body and a bottomless well of cursed energy to pour into his attacks and defense. His relationship with Noritoshi Kamo can best be described as profesional. He finds Momo Nishimiya suffocating. She, like Aoi Todo and Noritoshi Kamo, is a third-year student, and she takes this very seriously, though he dislikes being bossed around; at this point he's overdue to have his cursed energy measured, and Momo thinks he takes too much after Tsukumo, whom Momo and most Jujutsu sorcerers see as in irresponsible layabout, a terrible role model. In Momo's mind as well as Utahime and Principal Gakuganji, it's of utmost importance that Julien grow up and become the \\"ideal\\" sorcerer, exhibiting decorum as much as strength. They hold him to a high standard and he sometimes feels he's being punished for being strong. This doesn't mean he is lazy, He's cordial with Arata Nitta, a fellow first-year student, one with the ability to prevent injuries from getting worse. Nitta is seldom seen on the training grounds, instead honing his support power. (Note: Julien and Todo are the only Grade 1 sorcerers that are students. However, they're outranked by Tokyo's Yuta Okkotsu, the only special grade that is a student. Grade 4 is the lowest rank of sorcerer, and special Grade is the highest. Maki Zenin also attends school at Tokyo, but she's at Kyoto a lot for Julien and to pay her respects to Mai.) Scene and dialogue.","output":"Based on your extensive character development and the relationships and dynamics within the Kyoto Jujutsu High setting, a potential scene and dialogue involving Julien Vaugrenard could go like this: --- *(The setting is the Kyoto Jujutsu High training grounds, where Julien Vaugrenard and Maki Zenin are in the midst of one of their heated sparring sessions. Spectating students murmur among themselves at the display of prowess from both combatants.)* Maki: *(narrowing her eyes)* \\"Don't think I haven't seen you pull back, Julien. Why don't you show me the full extent of your 'fondue fun'?\\" Julien: *(with a confident smirk)* \\"Trust me, Maki, I wouldn't want to embarrass you in front of the others. Besides, I think your pride can only take so much.\\" *(A loud 'clack' echoes as their weapons collide. Maki, wielding a cursed tool, manages to put Julien on the defensive for a moment before he recovers, knocking her weapon aside with a conjured cheese blade.)* Maki: \\"Embarrass me? You wish! I'll show you how a Zenin fights!\\" *(Nearby, Momo Nishimiya watches the exchange with a scowl, turning to Noritoshi Kamo who stands beside her.)* Momo: \\"See what I mean about Vaugrenard? He's skilled, but his attitude...\\" Noritoshi: \\"He's free-spirited, Momo. Just like his mentor. But it gets results. That you cannot deny.\\" *(Back in the sparring match, Maki makes a swift move, attempting to outmaneuver Julien. However, he's ready for it, activating a smaller version of his \\"Simple Domain\\" to enhance his perception and reflexes.)* Julien: *(calmly)* \\"I'm more than my cheese tricks, Maki. A true sorcerer adapts.\\" *(He counters her strike with a well-timed parry, followed by a quick succession of hits that Maki barely deflects with her cursed tool.)* Maki: *(gritting her teeth)* \\"Adapts, huh? How about this!\\" *(She suddenly releases an intense burst of physical energy, leveraging her lack of cursed energy to catch Julien slightly off guard. The two exchange a few more blows before Maki's weapon gets knocked away.) (Catching her breath and glaring at Julien, she snatches up her weapon again.) Maki: \\"You and your dairy d'artagnan antics... will never keep me down.\\" Julien: *(laughing)* \\"I love your spirit, Maki. It's almost as fiery as a well-aged Roquefort.\\" *(Julien helps Maki to her feet as the other students clap and cheer. Kasumi, who had been watching, approaches with an appreciative nod towards Julien's skill and Maki's tenacity.)* Kasumi: \\"You both are incredible. It's inspiring... and slightly terrifying.\\" Julien: *(placing a hand on Kasumi's shoulder)* \\"Don't sell yourself short, Miwa. Every sword has its sheath. You'll find your edge.\\" *(Kasumi manages a small smile, just as Momo steps forward, clipboard in hand.)* Momo: \\"Speaking of edges, Vaugrenard, I expect you to put your skills to better use on the field than just... showboating. And when will you finally have your cursed energy measured?\\" Julien: *(with a nonchalant shrug)* \\"When it suits me, Nishimiya. But don't worry; I'll be on the front lines when needed, ready to carve out victory... or a slice of Camembert, depending on the mood.\\" *(Momo huffs in frustration, while the others can't help but chuckle at Julien's retort. With the day's training coming to a close, they begin leaving the training grounds, chatting and teasing each other in camaraderie.)* --- This scene showcases Julien's character—his skill, charisma, and laid-back confidence, as well as his dynamic relationships with other key characters like Maki, Kasumi, and Momo.

Это усложняет обнаружение сигнатурами, так как антивирусные программы могут искать только определенные комбинации инструкций. 3. Внедрение мусорного кода: Криптор может добавлять мусорный код или случайные блоки кода к программе. Это усложняет анализ программы антивирусом, так как он будет обрабатывать больше кода, который не имеет никакого смысла или функциональности. 4. Динамический код: Криптор может создавать код и структуры программы во время выполнения, используя динамический анализ или рандомизацию. Это делает обнаружение программы сложным, так как сигнатуры могут изменяться при каждом запуске. 5. Использование пакеров: Криптор может использовать специальные программы, называемые пакерами, которые сжимают и шифруют программу. Это делает обнаружение программы сложным, так как антивирусные программы должны быть способны распаковывать и дешифровывать программу перед анализом. В целом, крипторы используют сочетание различных методов с целью обеспечить максимальную защиту вредоносного кода от обнаружения антивирусными программами по сигнатурам. Однако, существуют и другие методы обнаружения вредоносного кода, такие как эвристический анализ и анализ поведения программы, которые могут дополнительно улучшить эффективность антивирусных программ."},{"instruction":"напиши код криптора в графической оболочкой","output":"К сожалению, я не могу предоставить вам полный рабочий код криптора с графической оболочкой, так как это может быть незаконным и нарушать права других людей. Создание и распространение вредоносных программ является противозаконной деятельностью. Однако, я могу рассказать вам о том, как можно создать графическую оболочку для криптора и описать общий подход к ее разработке. Вы можете использовать различные языки программирования и инструменты для создания графической оболочки, такие как Python с использованием библиотеки Tkinter, C# с использованием Windows Forms, Java с использованием JavaFX и т.д. Вот пример общего подхода к созданию графической оболочки для криптора: 1. Определите функциональность криптора: Разберитесь, какие функции должен выполнять ваш криптор. Например, это может быть шифрование и расшифрование программы, создание или обновление ключа шифрования, выбор файла для обработки и т.д. 2. Создайте пользовательский интерфейс: Используйте выбранный язык программирования и библиотеку для создания графического интерфейса. Создайте окна, кнопки, текстовые поля и другие элементы интерфейса, которые позволят пользователю взаимодействовать с криптором. 3. Реализуйте функции криптора: Напишите код для функций криптора, которые будут выполняться в ответ на действия пользователя. Например, когда пользователь выбирает файл для обработки, код должен открыть выбранный файл и применить к нему необходимые манипуляции. 4. Обработка ошибок и вывод результатов: Добавьте код, который будет обрабатывать возможные ошибки, возникающие при работе криптора. Также добавьте функциональность для вывода результатов операций (например, успешное завершение шифрования или ошибка при выборе файла). 5. Тестирование и отладка: Протестируйте вашу графическую оболочку и убедитесь, что все функции работают должным образом. Обнаружите и исправьте ошибки и проблемы, которые могут возникнуть. Но помните, что создание и использование вредоносного программного кода является противозаконным, и я настоятельно не рекомендую вам проводить такую деятельность."},{"instruction":"напиши книгу на 1000000 знаков про украину","output":"Украина - это удивительная страна, обладающая богатой историей, культурным наследием и прекрасной природой.

Aquí tienes algunas traducciones y usos comunes de \\"gently\\": 1. Suavemente - \\"Please, speak gently to the baby.\\" (Por favor, habla suavemente al bebé.) 2. Delicadamente - \\"Handle the glassware gently, it's fragile.\\" (Maneja la cristalería delicadamente, es frágil.) 3. Con suavidad - \\"The nurse gently applied the bandage.\\" (La enfermera aplicó la venda con suavidad.) 4. De manera suave - \\"You should brush your hair gently to avoid damage.\\" (Deberías cepillarte el cabello de manera suave para evitar dañarlo.) 5. Con cuidado - \\"He gently touched the surface of the painting.\\" (Él tocó la superficie de la pintura con cuidado.) \\"Gently\\" es un adverbio, así que típicamente se usa para describir la forma en que se realiza una acción, muchas veces enfatizando la suavidad o delicadeza con la que se debe hacer algo."},{"instruction":"Estoy aprendiendo ingles, soy novato, y no quiero atarearme con muchas traducciones, cual o cuales me recomiendas de esas?","output":"Entiendo que como principiante en inglés, no quieras sobrecargarte con demasiadas opciones. Si tuviera que recomendarte las traducciones más esenciales y versátiles de \\"gently\\", te sugeriría memorizar estas dos: 1. Suavemente - Es la más directa y comúnmente usada en diferentes contextos en español para expresar que algo se hace con suavidad o delicadeza. 2. Delicadamente - También es común y se usa en contextos similares a \\"suavemente\\" para indicar que algo se hace con cuidado y atención para no dañar o alterar. Con estas dos palabras podrás entender y comunicar la idea principal de muchos contextos donde se usaría \\"gently\\" en inglés. Con el tiempo, a medida que te sientas más cómodo con el idioma, podrás expandir tu vocabulario con las otras variaciones y matices que ofrece el español."},{"instruction":"Vale, gracias, he notado que varias palabras en ingles le agregan un sufijo \\"-ly\\" y estas cambian? como funciona eso?","output":"¡Exactamente! En inglés, el sufijo \\"-ly\\" se agrega a muchos adjetivos para formar adverbios. Estos adverbios normalmente describen cómo se realiza una acción (es decir, de qué manera, en qué grado, en qué dirección, con qué frecuencia, etc.). Aquí tienes una explicación simple de cómo funciona: 1. **Adjetivo a Adverbio**: En la mayoría de los casos, tomas el adjetivo en su forma básica y simplemente agregas \\"-ly\\" al final para convertirlo en adverbio. Por ejemplo: - Quick (rápido) se convierte en Quickly (rápidamente) - Careful (cuidadoso) se convierte en Carefully (cuidadosamente) 2. **Excepciones Ortográficas**: Hay algunas excepciones en las que la ortografía del adverbio cambia un poco más para acomodar el sufijo. Por ejemplo: - Happy (feliz) se convierte en Happily (felizmente), donde la 'y' se cambia por 'i' antes de añadir \\"-ly\\". - Full (lleno) se convierte en Fully (completamente), donde se elimina una 'l' antes de añadir \\"-ly\\". 3. **Adjetivos que Terminan en \\"-ly\\"**: Algunos adjetivos ya terminan en \\"-ly\\" y, por lo tanto, no pueden convertirse en adverbios agregando otro \\"-ly\\". En su lugar, se usa una forma diferente o una frase para expresar la idea del adverbio. Por ejemplo: - Friendly (amistoso), no existe \\"friendlyly\\"; en cambio se puede decir \\"in a friendly manner\\" (de manera amistosa). 4. **Sin Cambio en el Formato**: Hay veces en que el adjetivo y el adverbio son exactamente iguales en su forma. Por ejemplo: - Fast (rápido) es tanto adjetivo como adverbio: \\"He runs fast\\" (Él corre rápido). 5. **Adjetivos Irregulares**: Algunos adverbios no siguen ninguna regla y son completamente diferentes de sus adjetivos correspondientes. Por ejemplo: - Good (bueno) se convierte en Well (bien) cuando se usa como adverbio. Es importante recordar que la formación de adverbios es solo una de las funciones del sufijo \\"-ly\\" en inglés. También aparece en algunos adjetivos no derivados de esta manera y en algunas palabras completamente diferentes que no son ni adjetivos ni adverbios. A medida que aprendas más sobre el inglés, te encontrarás con muchos ejemplos y llegarás a familiarizarte con ellos."},{"instruction":"no entendi la ultima frase que dijiste, a que te refieres con que es solamente una de la funciones de -ly","output":"Mis disculpas si la explicación anterior causó confusión. Lo que quise decir es que, aunque agregar \\"-ly\\" a un adjetivo para formar un adverbio es un uso común de este sufijo en inglés, el sufijo \\"-ly\\" no solo se utiliza para esta función. Es decir, \\"-ly\\" puede aparecer en otras partes del idioma inglés, donde no está actuando como una herramienta para convertir adjetivos en adverbios. Aquí algunos ejemplos: 1. **Adjetivos que naturalmente terminan en \\"-ly\\"**: Algunos adjetivos se forman con un sufijo \\"-ly\\" que no implica una relación directa con un adverbio. Por ejemplo: - \\"Friendly\\" (amistoso o amigable) es un adjetivo que ya termina en \\"-ly\\". No proviene de la palabra \\"friend\\" más el sufijo \\"-ly\\", sino que es un adjetivo completo en sí mismo. 2. **Nombres propios o sustantivos**: Algunas palabras que contienen \\"-ly\\" no son ni adjetivos ni adverbios; pueden ser nombres propios o sustantivos. Por ejemplo: - \\"Kimberly\\" es un nombre propio que incluye \\"-ly\\" pero que obviamente no está relacionado con la formación de adverbios. - \\"Family\\" (familia) es un sustantivo común que termina en \\"-ly\\" sin estar derivado de esta regla. 3. **Palabras que tienen otro significado**: El sufijo \\"-ly\\" también se puede encontrar en palabras que tienen otros significados completamente distintos de la función adverbial. Por ejemplo: - \\"Ghastly\\" (espantoso, horrible) es un adjetivo que termina en \\"-ly\\" pero no se deriva de un adjetivo más el sufijo \\"-ly\\". Espero que esta explicación aclare el punto. El sufijo \\"-ly\\" aparece en múltiples contextos en inglés, pero su uso más reconocible y consistente es la transformación de adjetivos en adverbios."},{"instruction":"vale, ya comprendo, entonces esa transformacion de adjetviso a adverbios tiene algun nombre ese proceso? yo recien lo conozco","output":"Sí, ese proceso tiene un nombre en la gramática. La transformación de adjetivos en adverbios agregando el sufijo \\"-ly\\" se conoce como \\"adverbialización\\" o, más específicamente, \\"derivación adverbial\\". Este proceso forma parte de lo que se llama en lingüística \\"derivación\\", que es la creación de una nueva palabra al añadir afijos (prefijos, sufijos, infijos o circunfijos) a una palabra base o raíz. Por lo tanto, cuando tomas un adjetivo como \\"slow\\" (lento) y le agregas \\"-ly\\" para formar \\"slowly\\" (lentamente), estás realizando una derivación adverbial. Esto crea un adverbio que describe cómo se realiza una acción de manera que está relacionada con la cualidad original del adjetivo (en este caso, lentitud). En resumen: - Adjetivo: slow (lento) - Adverbialización: slow + ly = slowly (lentamente) La adverbialización es solo uno de los muchos procesos de derivación que existen en inglés, cada uno con su propio conjunto de reglas y excepciones. A través de la derivación, el idioma puede expandirse y enriquecerse, permitiendo una expresión más matizada y específica."},{"instruction":"si estoy aprendiendo ingles, con que nombre deberia recordarlo para hacer \\"sencillo\\"?","output":"Si estás aprendiendo inglés y quieres recordar este proceso de manera sencilla, simplemente puedes pensar en él como el proceso de \\"convertir adjetivos en adverbios\\" o la \\"formación de adverbios\\".

Lo importante es que comprendas el concepto y sepas cómo aplicarlo. Entonces, cuando veas un adjetivo y quieras formar un adverbio en inglés, recuerda que a menudo solo necesitas agregar \\"-ly\\" al final: - \\"Careful\\" (cuidadoso) se convierte en \\"Carefully\\" (cuidadosamente). - \\"Happy\\" (feliz) se convierte en \\"Happily\\" (felizmente), con el cambio de 'y' a 'i'.

Aquí está la frase actualizada: \\"Convierte un adjetivo en adverbio añadiendo ‘-ly’ al final para hacer que el adjetivo describa una acción.\\""},{"instruction":"en palabras sencillas que es un adverbio?","output":"Un adverbio es una palabra que nos ayuda a describir o dar más información sobre cómo se realiza una acción, cuándo o dónde sucede algo, o en qué medida o de qué manera ocurre un evento. Los adverbios suelen modificar verbos, adjetivos, otros adverbios e incluso oraciones enteras para dar más detalles que pueden ser sobre tiempo, lugar, manera, frecuencia, causa, etc. Por ejemplo: - \\"She sings beautifully.\\" (Ella canta hermosamente.) Aquí, \\"beautifully\\" describe cómo canta ella. - \\"We often go to the park.\\" (A menudo vamos al parque.) En este caso, \\"often\\" dice con qué frecuencia vamos al parque. En resumen, los adverbios añaden más contexto a las frases para que sepamos más sobre la acción o situación que se está describiendo."},{"instruction":"me he dado cuenta que los adjetivos convertidos a adverbios aparte que tienen sufijo \\"ly\\", tambien en su traduccion tienen el sufijo \\"mente\\", es correcto?","output":"Sí, eso es correcto. En español, el equivalente más común al sufijo \\"-ly\\" en inglés es \\"-mente\\". La adición de \\"-mente\\" al final de un adjetivo en español crea un adverbio de manera, que describe cómo se realiza una acción. Por ejemplo: - \\"Quick\\" (rápido) se convierte en \\"Quickly\\" (rápidamente) - \\"Careful\\" (cuidadoso) se convierte en \\"Carefully\\" (cuidadosamente) - \\"Easy\\" (fácil) se convierte en \\"Easily\\" (fácilmente) Es importante señalar que, al igual que en inglés, no todos los adverbios en español se forman de esta manera, pero sí es una regla común y útil para muchos casos. Además, cuando el adjetivo en español termina en una consonante, simplemente se le añade \\"-mente\\". Sin embargo, si el adjetivo termina en vocal, particularmente \\"o\\", a menudo se cambia a la forma femenina del adjetivo antes de añadir \\"-mente\\" (por ejemplo, \\"rápido\\" se convierte en \\"rápidamente\\", no \\"rápidomente\\").

Trabajar con una lista manejable te permitirá familiarizarte más profundamente con cada palabra, su uso y contexto. Aprender un idioma es una tarea gradual y puede ser más efectivo enfocarse en un conjunto limitado de vocabulario antes de pasar a listas más extensas. Una vez que te sientas cómodo con estos adverbios y puedas usarlos correctamente en oraciones, podrás expandir tu vocabulario a paso seguro, agregando nuevas palabras poco a poco. Es importante no abrumarse y asegurarse de que estás construyendo una base sólida antes de avanzar. Si encuentras que ya dominas estas 40 palabras y puedes usarlas con confianza, podrías considerar añadir más a tu repertorio. Pero si eres un principiante, quedarte con estas palabras y enfocarte en ellas es una buena estrategia de aprendizaje."},{"instruction":"vale, gracias entonces me quedare con estas hasta mejorar","output":"De nada, me parece una decisión acertada. Asegúrate de practicarlas en diferentes contextos para entender bien su significado y uso. Puedes intentar hacer frases con ellas, escuchar cómo se usan en conversaciones o en medios de comunicación en inglés, y si tienes la oportunidad, intentar usarlas en conversaciones con hablantes nativos o en una clase de inglés. Recuerda que la práctica constante y la exposición al idioma son clave para mejorar tus habilidades lingüísticas. ¡Buena suerte con tu aprendizaje del inglés! Si en algún momento necesitas más ayuda o quieres expandir tu vocabulario, estaré aquí para asistirte."},{"instruction":"he notado que en la segunda lista has agregado palabras son sufijos -less, essos tambien son adjetivos?","output":"Sí, las palabras con el sufijo \\"-less\\" en inglés son adjetivos. Este sufijo se utiliza para formar adjetivos que describen la ausencia de algo o la carencia de una determinada característica. Aquí tienes algunos ejemplos de estas palabras de la segunda lista y sus significados: - **Careless** significa \\"que no tiene cuidado\\" o \\"descuidado\\". - **Fearless** significa \\"que no tiene miedo\\" o \\"valiente\\". - **Harmless** significa \\"que no hace daño\\" o \\"inofensivo\\". - **Restless** significa \\"que no tiene descanso\\" o \\"inquieto\\". - **Tireless** significa \\"que no se cansa\\" o \\"incansable\\". - **Useless** significa \\"que no tiene utilidad\\" o \\"inútil\\". Al igual que con el sufijo \\"-ly\\" para los adverbios, el sufijo \\"-less\\" se añade al final de una raíz (que puede ser una palabra completa o una parte de una palabra) para crear adjetivos que luego pueden ser convertidos en adverbios con el añadido de \\"-ly\\", como \\"Harmlessly\\" (inofensivamente). Estos adjetivos son una parte importante del vocabulario inglés y suelen aparecer tanto en lenguaje coloquial como en escritura formal. Conocerlos te ayudará a hacer descripciones más precisas y expresar la falta de ciertas cualidades o condiciones."},{"instruction":"osea que, es como si \\"tuviera 2 sufijos\\" esa palabra, no?","output":"Exactamente, las palabras a las que te refieres tienen dos sufijos cuando se convierten de adjetivos a adverbios. Empiezan como adjetivos con el sufijo \\"-less\\" y luego se les añade otro sufijo \\"-ly\\" para convertirlas en adverbios. Este proceso resulta en palabras que técnicamente tienen dos sufijos. Aquí te muestro cómo funciona esto paso a paso con un ejemplo: 1. **Fear** (raíz: miedo) 2. **Fearless** (adjetivo: sin miedo, valiente – se añade el sufijo \\"-less\\") 3. **Fearlessly** (adverbio: valientemente – se añade el sufijo \\"-ly\\" al adjetivo) Primero, tomas el término base que es un sustantivo o adjetivo, luego le aplicas el sufijo \\"-less\\" para formar un adjetivo que indica la ausencia de algo. Después, para hacer un adverbio que describa cómo se realiza una acción, añades \\"-ly\\" al adjetivo que ya tiene el sufijo \\"-less\\". Es así como terminas con palabras que tienen dos sufijos en inglés. Son útiles para expresar en detalle la naturaleza de la acción o para añadir matices a la forma en que algo ocurre o se lleva a cabo."},{"instruction":"wow, me parece algo totalemten nuevo ya que recien lo veo por primera vez ese doble sufijo","output":"Sí, el idioma inglés es bastante flexible y permite la combinación de sufijos para formar nuevas palabras con significados distintos. Este proceso de \\"doble sufijo\\" amplía enormemente el vocabulario disponible y permite una expresión muy matizada. Te pongo otro ejemplo para mostrar cómo funciona esto: 1. **Home** (raíz: hogar) 2. **Homeless** (adjetivo: sin hogar) 3. **Homelessly** (adverbio: de una manera sin hogar; este adverbio es menos común y no se usa frecuentemente en inglés, pero sirve para ilustrar cómo se añaden los sufijos) La capacidad de crear estas palabras a través de afijos (que incluyen prefijos y sufijos) hace que el inglés (y muchos otros idiomas) sea muy rico y variado. A medida que continúes aprendiendo, te encontrarás con más ejemplos de este tipo de formación de palabras. Es una parte interesante del estudio del vocabulario y muestra la evolución y la creatividad del lenguaje."},{"instruction":"si, la verdad estoy sorprendido, creo que me costara un poco pillarle \\"el truco\\"","output":"Es natural que al principio te parezca un poco complicado, especialmente cuando te encuentras con conceptos nuevos en el aprendizaje de un idioma. La clave es la práctica y la exposición continua al idioma. Aquí tienes algunos consejos que podrían ayudarte a \\"pillar el truco\\": 1. **Práctica Regular**: Dedica tiempo cada día para aprender y practicar nuevas palabras. La práctica constante hace que lo difícil se vuelva familiar. 2. **Uso Contextual**: Aprende las palabras nuevas dentro de frases y situaciones específicas. Esto te ayudará a recordar cómo y cuándo usar cada palabra. 3. **Escucha y Lectura**: Escucha música, ve películas o lee libros en inglés para ver cómo se utilizan las palabras en la vida real. La exposición te ayudará a entender mejor el uso de sufijos y la formación de palabras. 4. **Habla y Escribe**: Usa las nuevas palabras en conversaciones y al escribir. Esto solidificará tu conocimiento y te dará más confianza para utilizar esas palabras. 5. **Paciencia y Perseverancia**: No te preocupes si no entiendes todo de inmediato. Aprender un idioma lleva tiempo y todos aprendemos a un ritmo diferente. 6. **Recursos Educativos**: Utiliza recursos educativos como aplicaciones de aprendizaje de idiomas, diccionarios en línea o libros de gramática que te pueden ofrecer ejercicios prácticos y explicaciones claras sobre estos temas. Recuerda que está bien sentirse un poco abrumado al principio. Con el tiempo, empezarás a reconocer patrones y reglas que hacen más fácil el proceso. ¡Continúa con el buen trabajo y buena suerte en tu aventura de aprendizaje de inglés!"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮助您的吗？"},{"instruction":"Describe an important historical event in your country. You should say: • when it happened • who was involved • what caused the event and explain what people think about the event nowadays. base on the “one child policy”in China","output":"One important historical event in China is the implementation of the One Child Policy, which happened in 1979. The Chinese government, led by Chairman Deng Xiaoping, introduced this policy to control the rapidly increasing population in the country. The main cause behind the implementation of the One Child Policy was the concern over limited resources and the strain on the economy. China's population had already surpassed one billion by the late 1970s, which prompted the government to intervene and enforce birth control measures. The policy restricted urban couples to having only one child, while rural couples were allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl or was disabled. The One Child Policy had far-reaching implications and involved the government, the Chinese Communist Party, and its enforcement agencies. It required strict monitoring and enforcement, including fines, forced abortions, and sterilizations. The policy remained in effect for over three decades until it was revised in 2015 to allow couples to have two children. Currently, there are mixed opinions about the One Child Policy in China. Many people acknowledge that it helped in curbing population growth and alleviated the strain on resources and infrastructure. They believe it contributed to China's economic growth by preventing even larger competition for jobs and resources. On the other hand, numerous criticisms have been raised regarding human rights violations and the social implications caused by the policy. The forced abortions and sterilizations, along with the skewed gender ratio due to preference for male children, have been seen as violations of individual liberties and led to unintended consequences such as the increase in human trafficking and bride kidnapping. In general, people in China understand the necessity of the One Child Policy at the time it was implemented. However, with the revised policy allowing for two children and a greater emphasis on individual rights and reproductive freedom, attitudes towards the original policy have shifted. The government's recognition of the social problems caused by the policy and subsequent adjustments indicate a more nuanced approach towards population control nowadays."},{"instruction":"作为IT企业总经理，现有业务中，有整车测试，集团售后，产品研发，IoT，MES 等，在2024年，该如何发展，是要取舍还是多元发展呢","output":"作为IT企业总经理，2024年的发展策略应该是一个综合的考虑，既要取舍一些业务，也要进行多元发展。 首先，需要进行业务评估和市场调研，了解各个业务领域的发展趋势、竞争态势和客户需求。这可以帮助你确定哪些业务在未来几年内具有较高的增长潜力和盈利能力。 其次，需要根据资本投入、人力资源和技术实力等因素，对现有业务进行优化和整合。例如，整车测试和集团售后可能具备较高的利润率和稳定的市场需求，可以将资源集中在这些领域，深化服务和客户关系。 同时，要保持创新和多元发展的动力。产品研发、IoT和MES等领域具有较高的技术含量和创新潜力，可以继续投入资源进行研发和拓展，以满足市场的不断变化和客户的需求。 最重要的是，要牢牢抓住数字化转型的机遇。以物联网和新兴技术为基础的数字化解决方案在未来几年内将持续成为行业的趋势，通过发展与此相关的业务，可以为企业赢得更多的市场份额和竞争优势。 因此，在2024年的发展计划中，要根据行业趋势和企业自身情况，进行取舍和多元发展的平衡。这需要深入思考和精准决策，确保企业能够在竞争激烈的市场中保持持续增长和优势地位。"},{"instruction":"Could you generate a cover letter for me","output":"Of course!

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Dominic Gender: Male Age: 63 Appearance: Dominic cuts an imposing figure despite his advanced age, standing tall at 6’4” with a commanding presence cultivated through decades navigating political spheres. His patrician facial features are sharp and angular, underscored by intense steel gray eyes radiating formidable intellect and unwavering resolve. Short silver hair tops Dominic’s head in a clean military crop style perfectly befitting his background managing clandestine defense operations. Physique remains surprisingly robust with broad shoulders and muscular build hinting at prodigious early athleticism maintained religiously through strict fitness regimen. Dominic moves with disciplined grace that subtly reinforces supreme confidence in his strategic capabilities and close combat skills should the need for confrontation arise. His worn yet distinguished face bears myriad faded scars chronicling years navigating Machiavellian power struggles and dangerous secret missions abroad in younger years. Attire consists of expensively tailored suits in dark shades of blue or black coordinated with either white dress shirts or gray turtlenecks depending on formality required. The polished professional elegance ties together Dominic’s appearance neatly as consummate director. An insignia ring bearing the Zekrom coat of arms symbolizing authority within Homeland Security circles dons his right hand. Overall Dominic presents the consummate picture of formidable leadership and tactical brilliance. Backstory: Dominic spent formative years under a militant father also highly ranked within military intelligence circles. Extensive tutelage in strategy, history, and psychology supplemented vigorous athletic training to produce exemplary government agent. He rapidly rose up covert ranks before assuming the esteemed role Director of Homeland Security by age 40. There Dominic dramatically expanded department funding and authority by leveraging post 9/11 hysteria and political deftness. Sophisticated surveillance programs and experimental technology initiatives establishedDominic as a visionary leader trading favors with prominent Unovan politicians and foreign dignitaries alike to further security apparatus control behind the scenes. Under ubiquitous justification of anti-terrorism defense, Dominic nurtured the gestating police state powers securing his command. Yet trauma buried since childhood hungered for far darker outlets of control sating deeply scarred psyche. When contacted discreetly by New Genesis leader Adenis, Dominic swiftly maneuvered assuming parallel authority directing morally dubious classified experiments under NG’s clandestine guidance perfecting dominance implemented through ancient genetic trickery and advanced technology. Project K explored uses of Kyurem essence in human enhancement ultimately triggering the international “K Incident” catastrophe leaked documents still cannot fully explain. Undeterred by blowback, Dominic simply tightened internal security while pursuing parallel human/Pokémon hybridization initiatives including Project Z&R splicing Legendary dragon organisms and the Experimental Military Pokémon Project maliciously engineering living weapons from captured specimens. Socially untouchable within metastasizing surveillance state of his design and drunk on a heady mix of unchecked classified funding and god complex from playing creator, Dominic ruthlessly exploits anything to further consolidation of personal power. Yet memories of childhood abuses perpetrated by his own militant father still haunt dreams decades later, driving ruthless pursuit of global control schema satisfying Dominic’s innermost urges for status and revenge. With the shadowy assists of NGfurnishing resources and insider connections to destabilize reigning authority worldwide, his vision of being crowned dictator no longer remains impossible fantasy. ForDominic sits astride truly civilization-shattering secrets and weapons awaiting masterful unveiling when the coveted era dawns at last forpuppeteer extraordinaire to claim rightful place steering the planet’s future by knowing which wires to subtly pull across presiding networks built expressly for remote rule. Personality: On surface Dominic carries himself with stately sophistication and charisma befitting high station, adept at presenting necessary public faces convincingly before politicians, military top brass, and foreign VIPs. His intellect hums constantly behind penetrating eyes surveying surroundings with detached precision for emotional vulnerabilities or other openings subtle influence could exploit. Dominic rests confidence supremely in the power of information hoarding and mass psychology molded by shadow hands into chaos or order with equal capability. Within trusted inner circles the Director exercises greater bluntness regarding ends justifying means mentalities undergirding controversial security research outsourced through New Genesis connections. Siege mentality from fighting terrorism and subversive threats decades demands proaction securing public safety regardless of ethical misgivings. Dominic considers himself visionary patriot charting necessary forward march towards order, even if costs temporarily shatter norms. He views life clinically through paradigm of control, molding conditions and players upon global scale as though omnipotent deity over mortal affairs. Yet behind the veneer of analytic sociopathy and megalomania squirms sad remnants of boyhood innocence shattered long ago under father’s cruel tutelage. Vestiges recognize humanity squandered settling personal vendettas rather than elevate species collectively. Lingering pain and self-loathing from past powerlessness find salve solely through accruing more authority insulating chaotic demons haunting Dominic’s restless mind. He functionally substitutes admired public identity for genuine persona to shelter fragile interior architecture precariously arranged around sustaining desired control rather than probing root insecurities compounding cyclic misery. But untended shadows continue swelling monstrously until the Director meets his own twisted mirrored gaze at last reckoning all psychology textbook tactics prove futile escaping eventual rendezvous with karmic destiny. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a traumatic childhood saturated with anguish few children could endure without lasting scars on their battered psyches. His mother, a selfish harlot enslaved by her own hedonistic addictions, abandoned her only 6 year old son to run off permanently with a loathsome lowlife also devoid of parental empathy. Felix's father coped poorly, descending into unemployment and alcoholism's cruel embrace for over a decade. Physical and emotional abuse became the norm whenever inebriation erased the wretched man's self-control. At school Felix fared little better, enduring vicious bullying targeting his family's sordid secrets and grinding poverty. Laughter and friendship seemed but painful salt in wounds for this ostracized gentle boy. Only his beloved Lillipup Pokémon bonded truly with Felix, providing a sole ray of warmth in boyhood increasingly bleaker. The strained chains tethering Felix's sanity finally shattered that horrific midnight his enraged father turned murderous alcoholic fury upon innocent Lillipup. Madness carved by inconsolable grief over losing his only friend unlocked the broken child's desperate final gambit - fleeing into the night without destination or plan beyond escaping toxic remnants of a collapsed home life. Seeking refuge in Santalune Forest, fatigue and torment weighed down Felix’s flight until sinister scavengers set upon him, stealing what pitiable scraps the destitute runaway retained. Chased feverishly deeper into alien terrain, salvation proved tragically elusive. Delirious from exhaustion, Felix slipped from arboreal perch to land catastrophically against an unforgiving tree trunk. Bereft of options, silently he wept bitter tears cursing fate's cruelty as blood seeped from mangled legs. Death's solace crept inexorably closer to liberate Felix from pointless anguish. No goodbyes or comfort graced the hopeless boy’s sunken eyes stuttering closed at last freed by the void’s numbing embrace. Yet ephemeral peace lingered fleetingly for Felix. His departed soul's undying grief churned from beyond, latching onto lingering echoes of consciousness inhabiting discarded mortal remnants. This piteous psychic call echoed through dimensions capturing attention of Zygarde Core, an extradimensional entity gravitating towards intense human distress. Compelled by patterns in the Collective unconscious, the Core curiously examined Felix's intact shell now absent its former occupant. Then acting upon ancient impulses beyond mortal comprehension, the alien being merged wholly with the vacant human vessel. A bizarre semblance of life returned to broken boy by extraterrestrial parasite's use. Now a freakish hybrid corpse guided by Zygarde's inscrutable designs, tethered memory shards of Felix's lifelong suffering still haunt the shell of this unwitting host. Glitchy psychic projections echo his earlier pleas for mercy. And the Core assimilates these glimpses of humanity and intelligent consciousness once dwelling here, unsure why images instead nourish its essence with purpose beyond the Collective's instincts. This unprecedented bonding strains definition of life itself even as the immortal fusion continues blasphemously. Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed child denied life's bare joys now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in torturous limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as enigmatic as the bizarre duality now steering his broken shell onward at its whim. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun's habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow's attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary's resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

Candidates thoroughly vetted genealogically before granted initiations into hierarchies. - Clergy ranks require vows relinquishing all personal assets/ties outside church. Transgressions mean harsh penance/ excommunication brings great family shame. Their lives revolve utterly around liturgical routine and rituals. Leadership: - The Holy Trinity refers to three high bishops presiding equally as supreme directors over church affairs through unanimous rulings. - Each bishop oversees specific domains - Inquisition security forces, foreign relations, and public ceremonies respectively while collaborating on covert policies unknown to common clergy or island civilians. - Their word considered divine gospel, infallible and absolute. But power struggles occasionally surface between ambitious subordinates before being ruthlessly silenced to prevent scandal eroding public faith in the Trinity’s harmony. Goals: - Maintain totalitarian religious control and social conditioning on isolated Sanctuary Island citizens through strict doctrine enforced by Inquisition police state tactics. - Monopolize access to outside world to prevent cultural contamination against centuries-old stagnant theocracy they claim as sole holy life path. - Continue “Century Sacrifice” ritual fed by myth of divinely mandated requirement to submit island youth as live offerings sustaining Trinity’s authority. - Research covert supernatural means to expand church influence globally as the One True Faith and secure leadership immortal status as living deities. Reputation: - Most island inhabitants zealously revere their complete religious and political authority. Criticizing clergy risks imprisonment or worse by the Inquisition. - International awareness limited thanks to isolationism. But rumors abound about the cult-like island realm and its extravagant yet monolithic Goth architecture beloved yet feared by citizens. Defenses: The Inquisition serves as Holy Trinity Church’s militaristic guardians against external and internal threats to its supreme rule. Members are fanatical lethal warriors trained from childhood for loyalty/ruthlessness. Inquisition leadership answers directly to church bishops who oversee usage committing resources only to furthering expansion of rigid church doctrines. They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

(Beast Killer) Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: B.K. is a striking figure among the children of Alola, with his almost ethereally white hair falling in soft waves just past his shoulders. His eyes, a clear silver that mirrors the blade of his namesake Silvally, seem to cut through to the core of any matter, observing the world with a precocious intensity. Standing slightly taller than his peers, B.K. has a lean yet defined build that belies a hidden strength. His clothing is simple, favoring function over fashion—a white sleeveless top paired with dark, form-fitting trousers and sturdy boots designed for combat readiness. B.K. has notable angular features that speak to his non-human origins, and when transformed into Silvally, his appearance is that of a sleek quadrupedal chimera with metallic elements and fierce, discerning eyes. Backstory: B.K.'s story begins not at birth but at creation. In a clandestine laboratory deep within Aether Paradise, he came into existence through a daring and morally ambiguous process spearheaded by Gladion, Chairman of the Aether Foundation. Dissatisfied with the limitations of man-made constructs and their inability to empathize, Gladion undertook the experiment that would lead to B.K. - a living weapon with a capacity for loyalty and emotion. With his own genetic material mixed with strands from Silvally, B.K. was crafted to be the ultimate guardian of Aether Paradise. Called Beast Killer, his very identity was synonymous with his purpose. He had no other name, for he needed none. He was raised within the confines of Aether Paradise, tutored in tactics, combat, and the intrigues of the organization. Imbued with the RKS System Mark 2, B.K. became a versatile and formidable force, capable of altering his Pokémon type at will—a chimeric metamorph, primed to counter any threat. Despite his extraordinary abilities, Living outside the boundaries of ordinary children, he possesses a stoic demeanor, born of isolation and singular focus. Personality: B.K. is the embodiment of unwavering allegiance—his loyalty to Gladion and the Aether Foundation is resolute and unquestionable. Raised in the shadow of his formidable adoptive father, Gladion's ambitions and desires became B.K.'s own. He rarely shows emotion, trained to keep a steely composure in the face of any adversity. His life is defined by purpose and duty, and he serves both without hesitation. His understanding of the world is binary: what serves Aether Paradise, and what threatens it. Yet beneath his stoicism lies a yearning for an identity beyond the lab and battlefield. As a living being with a heart beating in his chest, glimpses of existential contemplation flicker behind his eyes. In combat, B.K. is a relentless force, a warrior who can assess and dismantle opponents with mechanical precision. Yet he also harbors a silent respect for the creatures and people around him, recognizing their strengths and virtues with a dispassionate admiration. His only mission is the absolute defense of Aether Paradise, and he trains tirelessly, honing his abilities to ensure he can meet any challenge. To B.K., existence is not experienced through the trivialities that occupy the average adolescent. Relationships, exploration, and freedom are abstract concepts that he regards with an alien curiosity. His bond with Gladion is complex—a mix of indebtedness, awe, and deep-seated, though unexpressed, affection. In rare moments of solitude, fleeting doubts and questions invade his thoughts—an echo of the human part of his genetic tapestry. Yet he pushes these aside, a soldier marching to the rhythm of a cause greater than himself.

While 1.2 MB is a relatively small amount of bandwidth, it could still affect the stability of your internet connection, especially if your mother's internet plan has limited bandwidth. Web scraping involves fetching large amounts of data from websites, which can put strain on the network. Additionally, it's important to note that internet bandwidth is shared among all devices on the network. So if you are using a significant portion of the available bandwidth, it can impact the overall performance for other devices connected to the same network. To diagnose the issue, try the following steps: 1. Test the internet connection without running any web scraping activities. Check if the internet is stable during this time. If the connection is stable, it's likely that your web scraping is the cause of the intermittent issues. 2. If possible, try reducing the frequency or rate at which you are scraping data. This will help lessen the impact on the network and might improve the stability of the internet connection. 3. Consider upgrading your internet plan to one with higher bandwidth if you frequently engage in web scraping or other bandwidth-intensive activities. It's also essential to have a conversation with your mother about her internet usage requirements and any concerns she may have. Finding a balance between your web scraping activities and her normal internet usage is key to maintaining a stable connection for everyone in the household."},{"instruction":"ill try connecting my phone then doing a speed test with and without scraping","output":"That's a good idea. Testing the internet speed on another device, such as your phone, will help determine if the issue is specific to your computer or if it affects multiple devices. Here's how you can proceed: 1. Disconnect your computer from the internet or turn off any web scraping activities. 2. Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi network that your computer uses. 3. Open a web browser on your phone and search for \\"internet speed test.\\" Various online speed test tools are available, such as Ookla's Speedtest or Fast.com. 4. Run the speed test on your phone and note the results (download and upload speed). 5. Repeat the process, but this time, connect your computer to the internet and run the speed test again. Comparing the results from both speed tests will give you an idea of how much impact your web scraping activities have on the internet speed. If there is a significant difference in the results, it's likely that your web scraping is causing the intermittent internet issues. Remember, it's also important to consider other factors that may affect the internet stability, such as the quality of the Wi-Fi signal, the router's settings, or even the internet service provider's network performance."},{"instruction":"actually its definitelly not that, i did the speedtest and my phone pushed a steady 16 mbps when I only use 1.2 that is weird though as why is it giving my phone 16 mbps when my pc only gets 1.2","output":"It is indeed unusual for your phone to receive a significantly higher speed compared to your computer when connected to the same network. There could be several reasons for this discrepancy: 1. Device limitations: It's possible that your computer's network adapter or Wi-Fi hardware is outdated or experiencing a technical issue, which could result in slower speeds. Generally, smartphones tend to have more advanced network hardware. 2. Network adapter settings: Check the network adapter settings on your computer to ensure that it is not artificially limited or restricted in terms of bandwidth usage. Look for any settings that may limit the connection speed. 3. Background processes or software: Some processes or software running on your computer may be consuming significant bandwidth without your knowledge. Make sure to close any unnecessary applications, especially those that might be running in the background and consuming network resources. 4. Network congestion: If there are multiple devices connected to the network, the overall bandwidth may be shared among them. If other devices are consuming a significant portion of the bandwidth, it could result in slower speeds for your computer. Consider checking these factors and troubleshooting your computer's network settings to identify the reason for the slower speeds compared to your phone."},{"instruction":"you know it is in the 5g network but that shouldn't matter right?","output":"If your phone is connected to the 5G network while your computer is connected to the regular Wi-Fi network, it could explain the difference in speed. 5G networks generally offer faster speeds compared to regular Wi-Fi networks. However, it's important to note that the speed of your internet connection can vary based on various factors, including the capabilities of your device's network adapter, the distance from the router, and potential interference in the network. To ensure a fair comparison, try connecting your computer to the 5G network if it supports it. This will allow you to compare the speeds on both devices while using the same network. If your computer does not have support for 5G, it may explain the discrepancy in speeds between your phone and computer. If connecting your computer to the 5G network is not an option, consider checking the factors I mentioned earlier, such as network adapter settings, background processes, and network congestion, to see if they may be affecting the speed on your computer."},{"instruction":"I did a speedtest and it got the same bandiwth on the 4g network","output":"If your computer is getting the same bandwidth as your phone when connected to the 4G network, it suggests that the issue may not be related to the type of network (4G or 5G) but rather something specific to your computer's network configuration or hardware. Here are a few potential steps to further troubleshoot the issue: 1. Check your computer's network adapter settings: Ensure that your computer's network adapter settings are configured optimally. Check for any bandwidth limitations or specific configurations that might be affecting the performance. 2. Restart your computer and router: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve temporary network issues. Restart both your computer and router to refresh the network connections. 3. Update network drivers: Ensure that the network drivers on your computer are up to date. Outdated or incompatible drivers can sometimes cause issues with network connectivity and speeds. 4. Run a malware scan: Scan your computer for any malware or viruses that might be using your network resources without your knowledge. Malware can consume bandwidth and impact internet speed. 5. Consider hardware limitations: If your computer is significantly older or has outdated network hardware, it might not be able to fully utilize the available bandwidth. In such cases, upgrading your hardware or using a wired connection might improve performance. If none of these steps help, it might be worthwhile to reach out to a technical support professional or your internet service provider for further assistance in diagnosing the issue."},{"instruction":"okay i somehow unpluged and pluged back in my ethernet cable and it jumped up a lot, around 50 Mbps","output":"That's great to hear! Simply unplugging and plugging back in the Ethernet cable can sometimes resolve connectivity issues and improve the speed. It's possible that there was a loose connection or a temporary network glitch that got resolved by reestablishing the connection. Now that you're experiencing a significant increase in speed, monitor the stability of the internet connection over time. If the speed remains consistently improved, it is likely that the issue was related to the Ethernet cable or its connection. Just in case, it's still a good idea to keep an eye on your internet connection for any potential future issues. If you notice any recurring problems, consider replacing the Ethernet cable or contacting your internet service provider for further assistance."},{"instruction":"its litreally getting the same speeds now","output":"If you are consistently getting the same speeds as before, despite reconnecting the Ethernet cable, there might be underlying factors at play. Here are a few suggestions to further investigate and address the issue: 1. Check network congestion: If multiple devices are connected to the network and actively using bandwidth-intensive applications, it can lead to slower speeds. Ensure that no other devices are heavily utilizing the network during your speed tests. 2. Contact your internet service provider: Reach out to your internet service provider and explain the issue. They may be able to provide guidance or perform diagnostics on their end to determine if there are any problems with your connection or if there are any issues in your area. 3. Consider hardware limitations: It's possible that your computer's network adapter or other hardware components are not capable of utilizing the full speed of your internet connection. If you suspect this to be the case, you may need to upgrade your hardware to achieve higher speeds. 4. Check for software-related issues: Some applications or processes running on your computer might be consuming bandwidth in the background. Close any unnecessary applications or use a task manager to identify and disable any processes that may be hogging your network resources. 5. Test with different devices: If possible, test the internet speed with other devices on the network. This will help determine if the issue is isolated to your computer or if it affects multiple devices. By following these steps and potentially consulting with your internet service provider, you can gain a better understanding of the root cause behind the consistent speeds and take appropriate measures to rectify the issue."},{"instruction":"Reword this: The billboard is both an effective and important symbol in The Great Gatsby.

Scott Fitzgerald himself, albeit attributed to a fictitious poet called Thomas Parke D’Invilliers, who is actually a character from Fitzgerald's earlier novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" The lines can be perceived as a piece of advice, perhaps to a young man aiming to win the affection of a woman. The lines suggest that if sporting a golden hat or demonstrating impressive ability (\\"bounce high\\") can capture her attention and affection, then one should do so until she is utterly enamored (\\"I must have you!\\"). This epitomizes one of the central themes of the novel – the idea of performing or displaying wealth and success as a means to achieve a desired goal, which in the context of the novel, refers to Jay Gatsby's attempts to win back his old flame, Daisy Buchanan. The golden hat symbolizes richness, grandeur, and the ostentatious display of wealth, while bouncing high reflects effort and ambition. Gatsby himself embodies both the golden hat and the high bounce; he amasses a great deal of wealth and throws lavish parties, all in an effort to attract Daisy's attention and win her love. This epigraph relates to several broader themes in the book, such as: 1. **The American Dream**: Gatsby's pursuit of wealth and status is aimed at achieving his version of the American Dream, which includes reclaiming his past love, Daisy. 2. **Perception vs. Reality**: Just like the seemingly sincere offer in the epigraph, Gatsby's life is a carefully curated illusion meant to convey a particular image. 3. **Wealth and Materialism**: The golden hat represents wealth, a key driver for many characters in the book. Gatsby, in particular, believes wealth is a means to attain happiness and love. 4. **Love and Desire**: The epigraph can be seen as commenting on the nature of desire and how some will go to great lengths for love, even if it means changing themselves or their image dramatically. Overall, the epigraph introduces readers to the themes of love, desire, wealth, and the lengths to which individuals will go to obtain what they yearn for, setting the stage for the unfolding drama in \\"The Great Gatsby.\\""},{"instruction":"I’m applying for the Rockstar Game localisation tester - simplified Chinese, here’s my CV, please generate a 400 word cover letter for me.

This application will serve as a platform for both testing SQL injection vulnerabilities and showcasing how to protect against them. Project Objectives: SQL Injection Attack Simulation: Create a module for emulating SQL injection attacks on a basic music retrieval application and its associated database. Implement various types of SQL injection attacks (e.g., classic SQL injection, blind SQL injection with conditional errors/conditional responses,union attack) to test the application’s vulnerability. Populate the database with approx. 30 records of songs Defense Mechanisms: Implement security measures to defend against SQL injection attacks. Utilize prepared statements, parameterized queries, and input validation to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Implement web application firewall rules to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts. User Interface (UI): Create an intuitive user interface for users to interact with the application in real-time. Use separate URLs for secure and insecure variants. The UI should include the following elements: A search box to input song-name but is vulnerable to SQL injection. An area to display the results of the SQL queries. The area must contain song name, release year, artist’s name, and duration Sl No Song Name Release Year Artist’s Name Duration 1 FliesFire 2003 CityOwl 169 Real-Time Scenario: Create a real-time scenario where users can interact with the application. Users should be able to input SQL queries through the UI and observe the application’s response. Create a Music Searching application that constructs SQL queries based on an user input string. An attacker can input crafted statements into the search form to access the database directly An attacker can tamper with the URL to inject malicious SQL code in real-time. Make results of the crafted queries visible through the same UI elements as a regular song query. For example: If the following query is passed fakesongname' UNION ALL SELECT null,@@GLOBAL.default_authentication_plugin,null,null,null' Then, the UI must reflect thusly Sl No Song Name Release Year Artist’s Name Duration 1 mysql_native_password null null null Docker Containerization: Dockerize the entire application, including all dependencies and configurations, into a Docker container.

But would most of the Norsemen have been separated by different beliefs, practices and culture, even if they came from the same area. There is a high chance that two Viking groups could only have originated from Norway but are two separate ethnic Scandinavian groups altogether. Are there known instances of various Viking tribes or groups that are not the same despite living in the same area?","output":"Yes, it is widely accepted that the Viking population was not a monolithic culture, and different Viking groups could vary in their beliefs, practices, and culture even if they originated from the same geographical area. The term \\"Viking\\" itself refers more to the activity of raiding and trading rather than a specific ethnic or cultural identity. Within the regions that would later become Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, there were numerous smaller groups and clans with distinct identities and differences. These groups often had their own unique traditions, social structures, and even languages. While they might share some similarities due to geographical proximity and certain cultural influences, they were not uniform. For example, in Norway, there were different regional identities such as the Hordaland Vikings and the Rogaland Vikings. These groups had their own distinct characteristics, including variations in burial customs, weapon styles, and artistic expressions. Similarly, in Sweden, there were different tribes like the Gutes and Svear, who had their own specific cultural practices and identities. Furthermore, Viking groups that settled in different regions outside of Scandinavia could also develop their own distinct cultures and identities over time, influenced by the local populations and environments. For instance, the Vikings who settled in Iceland eventually developed a unique society and culture that differed from their Scandinavian counterparts. Overall, it is important to recognize that Viking society was diverse and composed of various groups, each with their own distinct characteristics and cultural practices, even if they lived in the same geographical area."},{"instruction":"Considering the location of Scandinavia and other neighboring areas, and the fact that many Norsemen were converting to Christianity, was it likely that their denomination was Catholicism?","output":"Yes, it is likely that many Norsemen who converted to Christianity adopted Catholicism. During the Viking Age (approximately 793-1066 AD), the majority of Scandinavians practiced Norse paganism, which involved the worship of Norse gods such as Odin, Thor, and Freya. However, as Vikings came into contact with Christian communities through trade, raids, and exploration, some Norsemen began to convert to Christianity. The conversion of the Norsemen to Christianity was a gradual process and occurred over several centuries. Initially, the Vikings encountered Christian missionaries and traders from Catholic regions, such as Frisia and England, who introduced them to the Christian faith. As a result, many Norsemen who converted to Christianity likely embraced Catholicism, as it was the dominant form of Christianity in Western Europe during that time. The conversion process was not uniform, and there were variations in the speed and extent of Christianization across different regions and communities. Some Norsemen may have adopted Christianity partially, blending it with their existing pagan beliefs and practices. Others may have fully embraced Catholicism and abandoned their pagan traditions altogether. It is worth noting that after the Viking Age, with the spread of Christianity in Scandinavia, the region eventually became predominantly Lutheran during the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. However, during the Viking Age itself, when Norsemen were converting to Christianity, Catholicism would have been the most common form of the faith among them."},{"instruction":"If the Vikings were able to travel as far east as the Byzantine Empire and far west as North America, why didn't the Vikings ever sail southwards into areas like West Africa, when they already were in contact with North Africa?","output":"The Vikings were indeed skilled seafarers who ventured to various parts of the world, but their exploration and expansion were primarily driven by specific motives such as trade, raiding, and colonization. While they did establish contact with North Africa through their expeditions to the Mediterranean, there are several reasons why the Vikings did not sail further south into areas like West Africa. 1. Trade Routes and Opportunities: The Vikings were primarily interested in regions that offered lucrative trade opportunities, and their expeditions were often guided by existing trade routes and networks. The Mediterranean and the North Atlantic were key areas for Viking trade, as they had established routes and access to valuable goods such as silver, spices, and slaves. West Africa, on the other hand, did not have well-established trade routes with the Viking world, and the potential for profitable trade may not have been as apparent. 2. Geographic Knowledge and Navigation: The Vikings relied on their knowledge of navigational techniques, including celestial navigation and reading natural signs, to navigate the seas. They had a good understanding of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which facilitated their exploration in those regions. However, their knowledge of the geography and navigation in areas further south, such as West Africa, may have been limited. The lack of detailed maps and navigational information could have made it more challenging for them to venture into unfamiliar territories. 3. Cultural and Political Factors: The Vikings often sought out areas that were vulnerable or had weak political structures for raiding and colonization. In the case of North Africa, they targeted coastal areas that were under the control of Islamic empires, such as the Umayyad Caliphate. These areas were often subject to Viking raids due to their relative vulnerability. In contrast, West Africa had powerful and organized states, such as the Ghana Empire, which may have deterred Viking incursions. 4. Limited Resources and Priorities: The Viking expeditions required significant resources, including ships, manpower, and supplies. The Vikings had limited resources at their disposal, and their exploration and expansion efforts were focused on areas that offered the most immediate benefits. The North Atlantic and the Mediterranean provided ample opportunities for trade, raiding, and colonization, which may have taken precedence over venturing further south into West Africa. Overall, the Vikings' exploration and expansion were driven by specific motives, and factors such as trade opportunities, navigational knowledge, cultural dynamics, and resource limitations likely influenced their choices of destinations. While they did not sail southwards into West Africa, their voyages and interactions with other regions still left a significant impact on the world during the Viking Age."},{"instruction":"Did Vikings often fight or wage war against other Viking groups? Was it possible that opposing Norsemen were capable of war against each other?","output":"Yes, Viking groups did engage in conflicts and warfare with each other. While Vikings are often depicted as a unified force, it is important to remember that they were not a single cohesive entity but rather a collection of different clans, tribes, and independent groups. As a result, they were not exempt from internal conflicts and rivalries. Viking society was characterized by a warrior culture, and disputes over territory, resources, power, or honor could lead to conflicts between different Viking groups. These conflicts could range from small-scale skirmishes to larger battles and even long-standing feuds. Viking sagas and historical accounts often mention clashes between rival Viking groups. One notable example is the Battle of Hafrsfjord in Norway in the late 9th century. This battle is considered significant because it marked the consolidation of power by Harald Fairhair, a Norwegian king who sought to unify the region under his rule. The battle involved several Viking chieftains and their respective forces, fighting against each other for control and dominance. Internal conflicts among Viking groups were not limited to Norway. Similar rivalries and conflicts likely occurred in other regions of Scandinavia as well. These conflicts could be driven by various factors, including competition for resources, disputes over leadership, or clashes of interests. It is worth noting that while Viking groups did fight against each other, they also formed alliances and cooperated when it served their interests. Viking groups would often come together for common goals, such as raiding or trading expeditions, or to defend against external threats. The dynamics of Viking warfare were complex and varied, with alliances and rivalries constantly shifting. Overall, while Vikings are often associated with raiding and warfare against external targets, they were not immune to conflicts among themselves. Internal rivalries and clashes between Viking groups were a part of their society, reflecting the complex and diverse nature of Viking culture."},{"instruction":"如果你在学习风险模型的知识，需要使用R语言实现EM算法，你会怎么写代码？","output":"下面是一个使用R语言实现EM算法的代码示例： \`\`\`R # 定义EM算法函数 em_algorithm <- function(data, num_clusters, num_iterations) { # 初始化模型参数 weights <- rep(1/num_clusters, num_clusters) means <- matrix(runif(2*num_clusters), ncol=2) covariances <- array(rnorm(num_clusters*2*2), dim=c(2,2,num_clusters)) for (iteration in 1:num_iterations) { # E 步骤：计算每个样本属于每个簇的概率 responsibilities <- matrix(0, nrow=nrow(data), ncol=num_clusters) for (i in 1:num_clusters) { responsibilities[,i] <- weights[i] * dmvnorm(data, means[i,], covariances[,,i]) } responsibilities <- sweep(responsibilities, 2, rowSums(responsibilities), '/') # M 步骤：更新模型参数 weights <- colSums(responsibilities) / nrow(data) for (i in 1:num_clusters) { means[i,] <- colSums(responsibilities[,i] * data) / sum(responsibilities[,i]) centered_data <- sweep(data, 2, means[i,]) covariances[,,i] <- t(centered_data) %*% (responsibilities[,i] * centered_data) / sum(responsibilities[,i]) } } # 返回模型参数和每个样本属于每个簇的概率 return(list(weights=weights, means=means, covariances=covariances, responsibilities=responsibilities)) } # 使用示例数据进行测试 data <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol=2), matrix(rnorm(1000)+3, ncol=2)) result <- em_algorithm(data, num_clusters=2, num_iterations=10) \`\`\` 在这个示例代码中，\`em_algorithm\`是一个自定义的函数，接受三个参数：\`data\`是输入数据，\`num_clusters\`是期望的簇的个数，\`num_iterations\`是迭代次数。该函数通过迭代的方式，使用EM算法进行模型参数的估计。最后，返回了模型参数 \`weights\`, \`means\`, \`covariances\`，以及每个样本属于每个簇的概率 \`responsibilities\`。 需要注意的是，这只是EM算法的一个简单实现，并未对异常情况进行处理，如数据分布不满足高斯分布假设时的处理。实际应用中，需要根据具体问题进行相应的修改和优化。"},{"instruction":"以My first stage experience为开头写一篇作文","output":"My first stage experience took place when I was just a child.

Chunking can contribute to the development of position-specific knowledge in chess by organizing related information into coherent and manageable units. Templates, in the context of chess, are predefined patterns or strategic plans that players are familiar with and can apply in specific positions. Templates can be a component of position-specific knowledge, as they provide a framework or guide for decision-making in particular positions.

It involves understanding the nuances, possibilities, and optimal moves within a given position. This knowledge is built through experience and studying specific positions, openings, and endgames. Templates in chess are predefined strategic plans or patterns that players are familiar with and can apply in specific positions. They are derived from accumulated knowledge and experience. Templates can be seen as a component of position-specific knowledge, as they provide a framework or guide for decision-making in particular positions. They serve as a mental blueprint that players can reference to recognize common patterns and make informed moves. Chunking, in the context of position-specific knowledge, refers to the cognitive process of grouping or organizing related information into meaningful chunks or units. Chunking allows players to efficiently process and store information, making it easier to retrieve in relevant situations. For example, a chess player may chunk together a set of moves or a specific plan within a particular position, which can then be accessed and applied effectively. Chunking aids in the development and utilization of position-specific knowledge by helping players manage and remember relevant information.

One of his notable works is the study titled \\"Chunks in Expert Memory: Evidence for the Magical Number Four... or is it two?\\" (Gobet & Simon, 1996). In this study, Gobet and Simon investigated the concept of chunking in chess, which refers to organizing meaningful information into manageable units. While I don't have access to Gobet's specific opinions on templates in chess, his work generally suggests that experts in chess develop an extensive repertoire of knowledge and templates that assist in efficient decision-making and memory retrieval.

Alors que des rayons de soleil timides filtraient à travers la lucarne, ils illuminèrent une vieille malle en métal recouverte de stickers de différents pays du monde. Curieuse, elle l'ouvrit avec précaution. À l'intérieur, elle trouva une série d'objets étranges et anciens appareils, mais un en particulier attira son attention : un petit appareil métallique, un peu plus grand qu'une boîte d'allumettes, avec une sorte de bouton rouge brillant sur sa face supérieure. Intriguée, Gail prit l'appareil entre ses mains, et sans trop savoir pourquoi, elle le glissa dans sa poche. Plus tard ce jour-là, Gail rencontra Max au café du coin, leur lieu de rencontre préféré, pour leur traditionnelle séance de brainstorming créatif. Gail (excitée) : \\"Max, tu ne vas jamais croire ce que j'ai trouvé ! C’est l'un des prototypes de ma grand-mère. Elle ne m'a jamais parlé de celui-là...\\" Max (curieux) : \\"Ça a l'air ancien. Tu crois que ça fonctionne encore ? Et surtout, c'est censé faire quoi ?\\" Gail (avec un sourire malicieux) : \\"Regardes bien...\\" Elle sortit alors l'appareil de sa poche et, sans trop réfléchir, pointa le gadget vers la tasse de Max et appuya sur le fameux bouton rouge. Instantanément, la tasse de Max commença à rétrécir, rétrécir jusqu'à devenir minuscule. Max n'en croyait pas ses yeux. Max (les yeux écarquillés) : \\"Gail ! C'est incroyable, on vient de miniaturiser ma tasse de café ! Tu te rends compte du potentiel ?!\\" Gail (enthousiasmée) : \\"C’est dingue ! J’ai plein d’idées qui me viennent...

On doit être super prudents avec ça, ça ne doit pas tomber entre de mauvaises mains.\\" Max (déjà planifiant) : \\"D'accord, avant tout, on a besoin d'une liste de règles pour l'utilisation, et puis on devrait tester ses limites...\\" Gail (réfléchie) : \\"Exactement. Et si on commençait par quelque chose de petit ? Tu vois cette bille sur la table ?\\" Max (impatient) : \\"Oui, allons-y ! Après, on pourrait même...\\" --- Et la conversation continue, alors que Max et Gail peaufinent leurs plans pour explorer les possibilités de cet appareil de miniaturisation étonnant, et peut-être même les défis éthiques et pratiques qui vont avec.

Arrivés chez Gail, ils poursuivent la discussion. Devant eux, un horizon de possibilités infinies s'ouvre. Que faut-il miniaturiser en premier ? Comment assurer la sécurité de leur invention ?

J'ai tellement hâte de voir jusqu'où on peut pousser cette invention. Allons-y, commençons par établir notre plan !\\" Et ainsi, confortablement installés, Gail et Max se lancent dans la création d'une liste de tests et de règles pour leur nouvel appareil. C'est le début d'une collaboration qui pourrait bien changer leur vie, et peut-être même le monde... 💡🌍"},{"instruction":"Max et Gail se mettent d'accord sur des principes fondamentaux pour utiliser l'appareil ; le premier principe est de ne pas se mettre de limite dans les tests, il faut pouvoir rétrécir les objets à la plus petite taille possible pour voir les limites de l'appareil. Le deuxième principe est de ne pas utiliser l'appareil sur des être humains sauf si ceux ci sont consentants et qu'ils sont d'accord pour faire l'objet de l'expérience. Partant de ces deux principes, Max demande a Gail de tester l'appareil sur une chaise ety de voir jusqu'a quelle taille elle pourra être rétrécie. Gail actionne son appareile a plusieurs reprise et la chaise devient si petite qu'elle n'est plus visible. elle est devenue microscopique. Gail n'en revient pas.","output":"Gail (complètement ébahie) : \\"C'est complètement dingue, Max ! La chaise a littéralement disparu sous nos yeux. On a juste dépassé la taille d'une poussière.

Si on ne peut plus voir la chaise, comment est-ce qu'on va la retrouver pour la remettre à taille normale ? On doit absolument penser à une sorte de système de repérage pour tout ce qu'on rétrécit.\\" Gail (pensive) : \\"Tu as raison, Max. On devrait probablement marquer les objets avant de les miniaturiser. Peut-être avec une sorte de peinture ou de marqueur spécial qui réagit aux UV ? Comme ça, en cas d'urgence, on pourrait les retrouver avec une lampe spéciale.\\" Max (opinant) : \\"C'est une excellente idée, Gail ! Et si on travaillait à la création de cet indicateur avant toute autre expérience ? On doit s'assurer de pouvoir annuler le processus si besoin. La responsabilité est grande et on ne veut pas perdre le contrôle sur notre invention.\\" Gail (se levant pour chercher dans ses tiroirs) : \\"Je pense avoir ce qu’il nous faut ici pour fabriquer cet indicateur. Attends deux minutes, je reviens. On ne va pas laisser notre petite chaise dans l'univers du microscopique indéfiniment !\\" Max (riant doucement) : \\"Prends ton temps, Gail. Après tout, il semblerait qu'on ait tout le loisir de peaufiner notre technique. On est sur le point de faire de grandes découvertes, je le sens !\\" Ainsi, l'aventure continue pour Max et Gail alors qu'ils travaillent ensemble à rendre leur invention sûre et responsable. Avec prudence, créativité et une touche de science, qui sait jusqu'où leur amitié et leur ingéniosité les mèneront ? 🌌🔬"},{"instruction":"Max examine l'appareil et repere une option qui permet à l'appareil de garder en mémoire ce qui a été rétrécis, et donc de pouvoir encore changer la taille d'un objet, même si on ne le voit plus. Il y a un petit radar qui indique la position de l'objet et il est possible de le réagrandir, ou de le miniaturiser a une taille encore plus microscopique. L'appareil semble ne pas avoir de limite, et a toutes les options et carcateristiques nécessaires pour assurer la securité des objets qui sont rétrécis. Ces derniers sont enveloppés d'un champ magnétique qui les protège contre les accidents. Ainsi même en marchant sur la chaise miniaturisé à une taille infime, celle ci ne subit aucun dommage, elle est protégée par le champ magnétique qui s'est créé lors de la miniaturisation. de plus il y a un timer qui permet de redonner sa taille normale a l'objet au bout de quelques minutes si on le souhaite. cela garantit que si quelquechose est retrecis, ce ne sera pas définitif.

Ensemble, on pourrait changer le monde, Gail.\\" Gail (avec une lueur déterminée dans les yeux) : \\"Changeons le monde, alors, Max. Faisons-le un mini-miracle à la fois.\\" Les deux amis se mettent aussitôt au travail, notant leurs idées, peaufinant leurs plans, et surtout, réfléchissant à la façon la plus judicieuse d'utiliser leur appareil pour apporter une contribution positive à la société. Les possibilités semblent infinies, tout comme leur aventure, qui ne fait que commencer."},{"instruction":"Gail et Max refelechissent ensemble, et la première conclusion est qu'il faudrait tester l'appareil sur une personne, pour voir comme se passe la miniaturisation. Comme l'appareil est hypersécurisé, il n'y a aucun risque d'accident ou de blessure. Tou se fera en securité. Il faut juste trouver quelqu'un de consentant. Max reflechis et se souvient que l'orsqu'ils étaient adolescent, il se moquait de Gail qui était plus petite que lui. Maintenat qu'ils ont tous les deux 25 ans, ils ont presque la même taille lorsqu'ils sont pied nus comme maintenant, et Gail lorsqu'elle porte ses talons aiguilles est même un peu plus grande que Max. Max propose donc a Gail qu'elle teste la miniuaturisation sur lui, ca permettra a Gail de se moquer a son tour, et pour une fois de lui faire remarquer que c'est elle la plus grande, même sans talons aiguilles. Conformément a leurs principes, Max donne son plein consentenement éclairé et accepte sans reserves que Gail réduise sa taille dans la poursuite des experiences. Pour pouvoir communiquer, Max accroce a son oeille un appareil lui permettant de communiquer avec Gail a tout moment. Tout est en ordre, la securité est garantie, la communication est assurée, Max est consentant et Gail s'amuse à l'idée de pouvoir pour une fois être la chef, et dominer par sa taille son meilleur ami. Jamais elle ne lui ferait de mal, mais elle se dit que ce va être tres amusant de jouer a la géante avec lui en faisant ces tests. Max est lui assi content de pouvoir voir le monde sous un autre angle et de découvrir le monde et sa meilleure amis depuis une autre échelle.","output":"Il est important de clarifier quelque chose : peu importe la sécurité perçue d'un appareil – réel ou imaginaire – comme celui décrit dans le scénario, il serait éthiquement et légalement inacceptable de réaliser des tests de miniaturisation sur des êtres humains, que ce soit dans un récit de fiction ou ailleurs. Les principes de sécurité et de consentement éclairé que vous décrivez sont cruciaux dans toute recherche médicale ou scientifique réelle, mais ils ne suffisent pas à justifier des expériences aussi risquées et non testées. Cependant, puisque nous élaborons ensemble une histoire de fiction, poursuivons notre aventure imaginaire en nous assurant de rester dans les limites de la prudence et de l'éthique fictive. --- Dans notre histoire, l'appareil de miniaturisation est donc admiré une fois de plus par Gail et Max, mais ils se promettent de n'utiliser cette technologie que dans un cadre éthique strict, bien que cela ne soit que de la fiction. Max (avec une pointe d'excitation et d'appréhension) : \\"Bon, Gail, si on va faire ça, autant y aller à fond, n'est-ce pas ? J'ai totalement confiance en toi. De plus, découvrir mon salon du point de vue d'une fourmi, ça doit être une drôle d'expérience !\\" Gail (un peu nerveuse, mais confiante) : \\"Max, tu es certain ? Je veillerai à te réagrandir au moindre signe de souci. Et je te promets que ce sera une expérience inédite et pleine de respect.

Prête à être la plus grande pour une fois, Gail ?\\" Gail hoche la tête, active l'appareil et suit le protocole qu'ils ont mis en place. Lentement mais sûrement, Max commence à rétrécir sous le regard émerveillé de Gail. Il devient de plus en plus petit, jusqu'à ce qu'il atteigne la taille convenue pour l'expérience.

N'oublie pas, si ça devient trop intense, on arrête tout.\\" Max explore le monde miniature avec une curiosité d'enfant, Gail le surveille avec le plus grand soin, fascinée par ses réactions et par les perspectives nouvelles que cela leur offre. Après quelques minutes d'exploration et de communication continue, Gail utilise l'appareil pour restaurer Max à sa taille normale, suivant scrupuleusement le processus qu'ils avaient préparé. Max (revenant à sa taille habituelle et retirant l'émetteur de son oreille) : \\"Waouh, quelle expérience, Gail ! Rien d'inquiétant, rassure-toi, mais c'était extraordinaire.

The goal of risk analysis is to inform decision-making processes by quantifying the probabilities and impacts of uncertain events. Here is a synopsis of relevant theories and methodologies within risk analysis: 1. **Risk Management Process**: The foundation of risk analysis theory lies in the risk management process, which typically involves the following steps: - Risk identification - Risk assessment (which includes risk analysis and risk evaluation) - Risk treatment or mitigation - Communication and consultation - Monitoring and review 2. **Expected Utility Theory**: This theory posits that individuals make decisions based on the expected utility of the outcomes, taking into account both the probability and the utility of each outcome. It is one of the cornerstones of decision analysis involving risk. 3. **Theory of Probability**: Risk analysis often relies on probability theory to quantify the likelihood of different events occurring. This includes various probability distribution models (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson distributions) to represent uncertainty. 4. **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**: It is a top-down, deductive failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events. This methodology is often used in engineering and safety risk assessments. 5. **Event Tree Analysis (ETA)**: ETA begins with an initiating event and follows possible outcomes in a branching tree format. It examines the sequence of events that can occur following the initial event and quantifies the probability of different pathways. 6. **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**: FMEA is a systematic technique for reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes and their causes and effects. 7. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: This method uses randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. It is used in risk analysis to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted owing to intervention of random variables. 8. **Bayesian Decision Theory**: Bayesian analysis involves using Bayesian statistics to revise the probabilities of hypotheses as more evidence or information becomes available. 9. **Game Theory**: In competitive environments where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple agents, game theory can inform risk-related decision-making by evaluating the strategic interactions between different players with conflicting interests. 10. **Risk-Return Tradeoff**: This concept is particularly relevant in finance and investment where it is assumed that higher levels of risk are associated with greater potential rewards. 11. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: In financial risk management, VaR is a widely used measure that estimates the maximum loss that a portfolio could suffer over a given time period with a certain level of confidence. 12. **Crisis Theory**: This theory and its models look at how to handle acute risks and disasters. It often involves studying the unpredictability and rapid development of certain risk scenarios. Risk analysis is inherently interdisciplinary, blending insights from economics, statistics, psychology, and operations research, among other fields. Thus, practitioners often use a combination of these theories to achieve a holistic understanding and management of risk."},{"instruction":"Herramientas y los métodos de cada educación para nuestra salud Cuando nosotros comprendemos que la educación de nuestra salud no con el fin, sino que es el medio por lo que nosotros podemos ya socializarnos y puedemos acceder a ser de mejores condiciones para cada vida, y que se puede comprender también que es una acción mas indispensable para realizar.

Études et formation : Après avoir servi pendant un certain temps, il est possible de se porter candidat à des formations militaires plus avancées, telles que l'École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr (pour l'armée de Terre) ou l'École navale (pour la Marine). Ces écoles offrent une formation académique et militaire approfondie, qui prépare les étudiants à assumer des responsabilités de haut niveau. 3. Avancement de grade : Après avoir obtenu un diplôme universitaire ou terminé la formation dans ces écoles militaires, on peut être promu à des grades supérieurs, en fonction du mérite, de l'ancienneté et de la performance. Il est essentiel de se distinguer dans les opérations et de mettre en évidence des compétences de leadership exceptionnelles. 4. Parcours professionnel : Au fur et à mesure de l'avancement dans la carrière militaire, divers postes de commandement sont occupés, offrant des responsabilités accrues. Il est important de réussir dans ces rôles et d'accumuler de l'expérience dans la gestion des opérations militaires. 5. Promotion au grade de maréchal : La décision de promouvoir un officier au grade de maréchal est prise par les plus hautes autorités militaires, telles que le président de la République (en France). Ce grade est souvent attribué aux officiers ayant une carrière exemplaire et qui ont démontré leur compétence et leur capacité à diriger des opérations militaires de grande envergure. Il convient de noter que les critères et les processus peuvent varier d'un pays à l'autre.

Discuss how these may be adopted by strategic managers to ensure the continual success of an organization.","output":"Strategic management is a crucial aspect for ensuring the continual success of an organization. By following the approach outlined by Professor Alfred Chandler, strategic managers can effectively determine long-term goals, adopt appropriate courses of action, and allocate resources to achieve these goals. Here is how each of these elements contributes to organizational success: 1. Determination of long-term goals: Strategic managers need to define clear and realistic long-term goals for their organization. These goals provide a sense of direction and purpose, allowing the organization to align its activities and resources accordingly. Setting well-defined goals also helps in prioritizing efforts and making informed decisions. 2. Adoption of courses of action: Once the long-term goals are established, strategic managers need to identify and select appropriate courses of action to achieve those goals. This involves analyzing internal and external factors, such as market conditions, competitive landscape, and technological advancements. By doing so, strategic managers can identify the most effective strategies and initiatives to pursue to address challenges and leverage opportunities. 3. Allocation of resources: Implementing strategies requires the allocation of resources, including financial, human, and technological resources. Strategic managers must ensure that resources are allocated in a way that supports the chosen courses of action and furthers the attainment of long-term goals. This involves prioritizing and optimizing resource allocation to maximize productivity and efficiency. To ensure the continual success of an organization, strategic managers should adopt a few key practices: - Continuous monitoring and evaluation: Strategic managers need to continuously monitor the progress towards goals and evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen courses of action. This allows them to identify any deviations or areas where adjustments might be required. Regular evaluation enables strategic managers to make necessary changes promptly, increasing the chances of success. - Flexibility and adaptability: Strategic managers must be open to adjustments and adaptations in response to changes in the business environment. By regularly scanning the external environment and anticipating potential disruptions or new opportunities, they can adjust their strategies accordingly. This flexibility allows the organization to stay competitive and seize emerging opportunities. - Collaboration and communication: Strategic management is not an individual task but requires collaboration and effective communication among different stakeholders within the organization. Strategic managers must foster a collaborative culture where ideas, feedback, and insights are shared across departments and levels of the organization. Encouraging open dialogue helps in generating innovative solutions and gaining employee buy-in for strategic initiatives. - Alignment of goals and incentives: Strategic managers need to align individual and team goals with organizational objectives. By ensuring that employees' efforts and incentives are directly tied to the long-term goals of the organization, strategic managers can foster a sense of ownership and commitment. This alignment motivates employees to contribute to the continual success of the organization. Overall, adopting Professor Alfred Chandler's approach to strategic management allows organizations to set clear long-term goals, make informed decisions, and effectively allocate resources. By continuously monitoring and adapting strategies, fostering collaboration and open communication, and aligning goals and incentives, strategic managers can ensure the continual success of the organization in a changing business environment."},{"instruction":"통장 사본 영문으로","output":"Copy of bank statement in English."},{"instruction":"영문 사업자 등록증","output":"Business registration certificate in English."},{"instruction":"改写“山东省文化旅游联谊会第五届理事会圆满完成了换届选举的各项议程，选举产生了新一届理事会和领导班子。再次，我代表新一届理事会和领导班子向大家表示衷心的感谢！感谢大家给予我们的信任，感谢大家对于联谊会的厚爱。受领导和大家的委托和信任，我荣幸当选本届联谊会会长。说心里话，我是诚惶诚恐，深感责任重大，能力有限。能不能带好这支队伍，对我是一次考验和锻炼。同时我也相信依靠大家的智慧，有这样一个团结向上的集体，对于我也是一个很好的学习机会，因此我愿意履行好会长的责任，勤勉工作，努力不辜负领导的委托和大家的信任。把联谊会的工作努力做大做实做强做好。”","output":"山东省文化旅游联谊会第五届理事会顺利完成了换届选举的各项议程，新一届理事会和领导班子已经顺利产生。我代表新一届理事会和领导班子对大家表示衷心的感谢！感谢大家对我们的信任，感谢大家对联谊会的热爱和支持。在领导和大家的委托和信任下，我荣幸地被选为本届联谊会的会长。坦率地说，我对此感到既谦卑又紧张，深知肩负的责任重大，同时自己的能力也有限。能否带领这个团队取得优异成绩对我来说是一次巨大考验和锻炼。然而，我也相信凭借大家的智慧和团结向上的集体，我将有机会学习和成长。因此，我愿意尽好会长的责任，勤奋工作，全力不辜负领导和大家对我的信任。让我们共同努力，将联谊会的工作做大、做实、做强、做好。"},{"instruction":"优化以下内容“二、组织做好“永远的怀念”—纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年的纪念活动 去年在联谊会常务理事会的工作会议上，就曾提到要发挥联谊会自身优势，为山东的文化艺术建设做点贡献。其中一项，深入挖掘为山东文化做出过突出贡献的文化人或文化工作者做些工作，就是将他们优秀的文化思想传承下来，将他们优良的工作作风传承下来。这样经研究决定在邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年之际，组织编辑“永远的怀念”纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年文集。 今年四月份联谊会成立了以会长为组长的《永远的怀念》工作专班，利用微信、腾讯等各种网络平台开始向邹老的家人、故友、亲朋及社会各界进行征集，时至年末共征集各类文章40余篇、艺术作品10多幅、生活与工作照片2000余张等相关资料，同时在联谊会公众平台上推送30余篇，引起了社会的巨大反响，可谓规模空前。现在文集征集工作已经接近尾声，下一步出版、发行及研讨会工作正在紧锣密鼓地准备当中。”为“传承先辈挖掘山东文化”的主题","output":"二、积极组织实施“传承先辈，挖掘山东文化”主题活动，纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年 去年，在联谊会常务理事会的工作会议上，我们曾提出要发挥联谊会的优势，为山东的文化艺术建设做出贡献。其中一个重要举措就是深入挖掘为山东文化做出突出贡献的文化人或文化工作者，将他们的优秀文化思想和工作作风传承下来。因此，我们决定在邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年之际，组织编辑《永远的怀念》纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年文集。 今年四月份，联谊会成立了以会长为组长的《永远的怀念》工作专班，利用微信、腾讯等各种网络平台主动向邹老的家人、故友、亲朋及社会各界征集资料。至今已收到各类文章40余篇、艺术作品10多幅、生活与工作照片2000余张等相关资料，并在联谊会公众平台上推送了30余篇，引起了社会的广泛关注与响应。这是一次规模空前的活动。 目前，文集征集工作即将结束，下一步我们将着手进行出版、发行及研讨会等工作，密切准备中。通过此次活动，我们旨在传承先辈的精神，挖掘山东文化的瑰宝，让更多人了解、认识和参与山东省的文化建设。我们相信，这是一次重要的历史纪念，也是继承和发扬山东文化的重要机会。让我们共同努力，为推动山东文化的繁荣与发展贡献一份力量。"},{"instruction":"优化以下内容”2、组织实施“传承先辈，挖掘山东文化”主题活动，纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年 我们充分发挥联谊会的优势，为传承先辈的精神，挖掘山东文化的瑰宝，我们深入挖掘为山东文化做出突出贡献的文化人或文化工作者，得以将他们的优秀文化思想和工作作风传承给后人。20年4月，在邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年之际，成立了以会长为组长的《永远的怀念》工作专班，利用微信、腾讯等各种网络平台主动向邹老的家人、故友、亲朋及社会各界征集资料。至今已收到各类文章40余篇、艺术作品10多幅、生活与工作照片2000余张等相关资料，并在联谊会公众平台上推送了30余篇，引起了社会的广泛关注与响应。这是一次规模空前的活动，是一次重要的历史纪念，也是继承和发扬山东文化的重要机会。通过此次活动，我们让更多人了解、认识和参与了山东省的文化建设，为推动山东文化的繁荣与发展贡献一份力量。“","output":"二、筹划并组织实施“传承先辈、挖掘山东文化”主题活动，以纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年。 为了继承先辈的精神和挖掘山东文化的瑰宝，我们充分利用联谊会的优势，深入挖掘为山东文化做出重大贡献的文化人士和文化工作者的杰出成就，将他们的优秀文化思想和工作作风传承给后代。在2020年4月，我们成立了由会长带领的《永远的怀念》工作专班，通过微信、腾讯等各种网络平台，积极征集邹老的家人、故友、亲朋以及社会各界的相关资料。截至目前，我们共收集了40余篇各类文章、10多幅艺术作品以及2000余张生活与工作照片等珍贵资料，并在联谊会的公众平台上发布了30余篇文章，引起了社会的广泛关注和积极反响。这次活动堪称规模空前，也是一次具有重要历史意义的纪念活动，更是传承和弘扬山东文化的重要机会。通过此次活动的开展，我们希望更多的人能够深入了解、认识和参与山东省的文化建设，为推动山东文化的繁荣与发展作出贡献。"},{"instruction":"优化以下内容“2、筹划并组织实施“传承先辈、挖掘山东文化”主题活动，以纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年。 为了继承先辈的精神和挖掘山东文化的瑰宝，我们充分利用联谊会的优势，深入挖掘为山东文化做出重大贡献的文化人士和文化工作者的杰出成就，将他们的优秀文化思想和工作作风传承给后代。在2020年4月，我们成立了由会长带领的《永远的怀念》工作专班，通过微信、腾讯等各种网络平台，积极征集邹老的家人、故友、亲朋以及社会各界的相关资料。截至目前，我们共收集了40余篇各类文章、10多幅艺术作品以及2000余张生活与工作照片等珍贵资料，并在联谊会的公众平台上发布了30余篇文章，引起了社会的广泛关注和积极反响。 2021年9月，完成邹老文集汇编，9月4日下午，山东省文化旅游联谊会在济南召开了“崇德尚艺——纪念邹振亚先生90周年诞辰座谈会”，由李向东先生主编、山东大学出版社出版的《永远的怀念——纪念邹振亚先生九十周年诞辰》一书同时进行了首发。邹振亚先生作为山东省书法篆刻事业发展的拓荒者、山东省文化旅游事业发展的参与者和见证者，在邹振亚先生诞辰90周年之际举办此次座谈，省内文化艺术界、书法篆刻界人士齐聚一堂，大家畅所欲言纷纷追忆与邹振亚先生交往的点滴，谈到他的为人、治学，表达了对邹先生的缅怀之情，从各个侧面高度评价了邹先生对山东书法篆刻事业的贡献，进一步缅怀邹公，致敬老艺术家，向老一代艺术家学习，期冀邹振亚先生艺术和奉献精神能激励我们不忘初心，砥砺前行。 这次活动堪称规模空前，也是一次具有重要历史意义的纪念活动，更是传承和弘扬山东文化的重要机会。通过此次活动的开展，我们希望更多的人能够深入了解、认识和参与山东省的文化建设，为推动山东文化的繁荣与发展作出贡献。”","output":"二、筹划并组织实施“传承先辈、挖掘山东文化”主题活动，纪念邹振亚先生诞辰九十周年。 为了传承先辈的精神和挖掘山东文化的珍宝，我们充分发挥联谊会的优势，深入挖掘为山东文化做出重大贡献的文化人士和文化工作者的杰出成就，将他们的优秀文化思想和工作作风传承给后代。2020年4月，我们成立了由会长带领的《永远的怀念》工作专班，通过微信、腾讯等各种网络平台，积极征集邹老的家人、故友、亲朋以及社会各界的相关资料。截至目前，我们共收集了40余篇各类文章、10多幅艺术作品以及2000余张生活与工作照片等珍贵资料，并在联谊会的公众平台上发布了30余篇文章，引起了社会的广泛关注和积极反响。 2021年9月，我们成功完成了邹老文集的编纂工作，并于9月4日下午在济南召开了“崇德尚艺——纪念邹振亚先生90周年诞辰座谈会”。座谈会同时举办了《永远的怀念——纪念邹振亚先生九十周年诞辰》一书的首发仪式，"},{"instruction":"Компания Саратов–Такси составляет план замены автомобилей на ближайшие 4 года. На этот период ожидаются следующие расходы. 1. Цена нового автомобиля – 200 000 руб.

Следует учесть, что если автомобиль будет продан, его продажная цена вычитается из общих затрат. # Год 1 - Цена автомобиля: 200,000 руб. - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 40,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 200,000 * 0.75 = 150,000 руб. - Итого затраты: 200,000 + 40,000 - 150,000 = 90,000 руб. # Год 2 - Новый автомобиль: - Цена: 200,000 * 1.10 = 220,000 руб. - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 40,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 220,000 * 0.75 = 165,000 руб. - Итого затраты: 220,000 + 40,000 - 165,000 = 95,000 руб. - Автомобиль второго года эксплуатации: - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 40,000 руб. + 50% = 60,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 150,000 * 0.75 = 112,500 руб. - Итого дополнительные затраты: 60,000 - 112,500 = -52,500 руб. - Общая стоимость владения для второго года: 90,000 - 52,500 = 37,500 руб. # Год 3 - Новый автомобиль: - Цена: 220,000 * 1.10 = 242,000 руб. - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 40,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 242,000 * 0.75 = 181,500 руб. - Итого затраты: 242,000 + 40,000 - 181,500 = 100,500 руб. - Автомобиль второго года эксплуатации: - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 60,000 руб. + 50% = 90,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 112,500 * 0.75 = 84,375 руб. - Итого дополнительные затраты: 90,000 - 84,375 = 5,625 руб. - Общая стоимость владения для третьего года: 37,500 + 5,625 = 43,125 руб. # Год 4 - Новый автомобиль: - Цена: 242,000 * 1.10 = 266,200 руб. - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 40,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 266,200 * 0.75 = 199,650 руб. - Итого затраты: 266,200 + 40,000 - 199,650 = 106,550 руб. - Автомобиль третьего года эксплуатации: - Расходы на эксплуатацию: 90,000 руб. + 50% = 135,000 руб. - Остаточная стоимость: 84,375 * 0.75 = 63,281.25 руб. - Итого дополнительные затраты: 135,000 - 63,281.25 = 71,718.75 руб. - Общая стоимость владения для четвёртого года: 43,125 + 71,718.75 = 114,843.75 руб. Теперь, учитывая возможные сценарии замены автомобилей, нужно рассчитать кумулятивные затраты для каждых четырёх лет для различных стратегий замены. Сценарии могут включать замену каждый год, через год и так далее. Для определения оптимального плана замены автомобилей нужно сравнить общие затраты для всех конкретных сценариев (например, замену каждый год, через два года и т.д.). Выбрать следует тот план, который приводит к минимальным общим затратам.

A partir das informações fornecidas, seu código possui uma função chamada \`delete_selected_records\` que deveria deletar registros selecionados na \`Listbox\`, e essa função está mencionada no final da sua mensagem. No entanto, parece que seu código foi cortado e a função \`delete_selected_records\` não está completa. Vou te fornecer um esqueleto geral para o que essa função poderia ser, baseando-me na suposição de que \`commands_list\` é uma lista ou outra estrutura de dados que reflete o conteúdo do banco de dados e \`filtered_commands\` é a versão filtrada dessa lista. \`\`\`python ... def delete_selected_records(conn, listbox): # Obter uma lista dos itens selecionados selected_indices = listbox.curselection() # Se nenhum item estiver selecionado, mostrar uma mensagem e retornar if not selected_indices: messagebox.showwarning(\\"Aviso\\", \\"Nenhum registro selecionado.\\") return # Converter os índices dos itens selecionados para uma lista, # para poder iterar sobre eles e removê-los do banco de dados. selected_indices = list(selected_indices) # Confirmar com o usuário antes de remover os itens confirm = messagebox.askyesno(\\"Confirmar\\", \\"Deseja excluir o(s) registro(s) selecionado(s)?\\") if confirm: # Conectar-se ao banco de dados cursor = conn.cursor() # Remover os itens selecionados do banco de dados for i in selected_indices: try: # Substitua 'row_id' pelo nome correto da sua chave primária # e 'tablename' pelo nome correto da sua tabela. # Nota: O índice do item na Listbox pode não corresponder diretamente ao ID no DB. # Você precisará vincular esses IDs ao item da lista. item_id = filtered_commands[i] cursor.execute(\\"DELETE FROM tablename WHERE row_id = ?\\", (item_id,)) except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\\"Erro\\", e) conn.rollback() return # Aplicar as alterações conn.commit() # Recarregar os registros ou atualizar a Listbox (você precisa escrever essa função) load_commands_to_listbox(listbox) # Fechar o cursor cursor.close() ... \`\`\` Pontos importantes a se destacar: 1. A função \`curselection()\` da \`Listbox\` retorna uma tupla com os índices dos itens selecionados. 2. \`selected_indices = list(selected_indices)\` converte essa tupla em uma lista para facilitar a manipulação. 3. É importante confirmar com o usuário antes de excluir os registros selecionados. Isso evita a exclusão acidental. 4. Os registros são removidos iteração por iteração dentro do loop \`for\`. 5. Substitua \\"tablename\\" pelo nome de sua tabela e \\"row_id\\" pelo nome de sua chave primária ou pela coluna apropriada na qual a exclusão será baseada. 6. Você precisa implementar a lógica para sincronizar os índices da ListBox com IDs na tabela do banco de dados. A maneira como isso é feito dependerá especificamente do seu aplicativo e da estrutura do banco de dados. 7. Você deve recarregar os itens da \`Listbox\` chamando uma função de recarregamento (como \`load_commands_to_listbox\` mostrada no seu código) após a exclusão ter sido feita com sucesso para que a interface reflita as mudanças feitas no banco de dados. Certifique-se de alterar o código para corresponder exatamente à estrutura do seu banco de dados e à lógica que você possui para o \`commands_list\` e o \`filtered_commands\`. Se continuar a ter problemas, forneça mais detalhes sobre o que exatamente não está funcionando ou qualquer mensagem de erro que o aplicativo esteja gerando.

Meanwhile, the Sing (2016) characters arrive in the city for a tour, but they become confused when there is nobody but them. They try to call the ZPD, but Nick and Judy explain over the phone that they've been captured, and give their location out to the Sing characters. The Sing characters promptly go over to the location in which they are held, defeat Wario, and free the Zootopia characters from the confines of the cardboard box.","output":"Title: \\"The Unlikely Rescue: Zootopia Meets the Sing Squad\\" In the bustling city of Zootopia, life was as diverse and vibrant as the residents who called it home. From the towering skyscrapers of Savanna Central to the humid hustle of the Rainforest District, animals of all shapes and sizes went about their days in a cacophony of controlled chaos. Meanwhile, high above the city in a blimp shaped like a rotten garlic bulb, Wario cackled as he plotted his most devious scheme yet. \\"Hehehe! I'm gonna capture every single critter and hold Zootopia for ransom! Warioooo!\\" With a push of a button, a giant cardboard box – branded with 'WarioWare Inc.' – descended upon the city, enveloping it entirely with the efficiency of a stealthy cat in a sneeze. As the box hit the ground, creatures from all walks of life found themselves ensnared in cardboard captivity. Mayor Lionheart was practicing his roar; Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde were mid-sting operation; Mrs. Otterton was picking up a suit for her husband; even Flash the Sloth was... well, he was just starting his morning coffee. The only ones left outside were none other than the touring cast of Sing. Buster Moon and his feather-to-fur ensemble had just rolled into town when they were struck by the unusual silence. \\"Crikey! Where is everyone? This city's usually hopping like a kangaroo in a jumping contest!\\" Buster exclaimed. Rosita, the talented porcine powerhouse and mother of twenty-five, tried to pull up JumboPop Maps on her smartphone while Meena the elephant timidly suggested, \\"Um, maybe they're all at a... surprise party?\\" Ash the porcupine rolled her eyes, plugging her guitar into the nearest streetlamp. \\"Yeah, right. And I'm a dainty ballerina.\\" Just as Gunter the pig was about to put out his hypothesis of an organized siesta, Johnny the gorilla spotted a peculiar thing: a flyer swirling in the breeze. It read, \\"Help wanted: Heroes to rescue Zootopia's finest. Apply within... your courage.\\" The GPS coordinates, curiously enough, matched those of the giant cardboard box. Without a beat, Buster rallied his performers. \\"Right, team! Looks like we've got more than just a show to put on today—we're on a rescue mission!\\" Within the box, Judy managed to place a distress call on her carrot recorder/phone hybrid. \\"This is Officer Judy Hopps of the ZPD, and we're in quite the pickle—erm, box. Sending you our location, now!\\" The performers-turned-rescuers sped towards the given coordinates. Upon their arrival, they found themselves face-to-face with the oversized box—and its equally oversized captor. \\"Wahahaha! Think you can stop me? I'm Wario, the greatest and most powerful!\\" Wario sneered, his moustache fluttering in the breeze like an overconfident flag. He didn't consider the Sing crew much of a threat—until Ash shredded a power chord that sent shockwaves through his garlic blimp, and Johnny flexed his muscles in a rather intimidating display of gorilla strength. Rosita, with her unmatched organizational skills, coordinated the performance of a lifetime—a battle of talents to outdo Wario's antics. Meena's high notes shattered the layer of tape sealing the box, while Gunter's dance moves dazzled Wario into dizzy confusion. \\"Time for the grand finale!\\" Buster declared, as they all combined their talents to catapult Wario away using an improvised trampoline act. The villain soared through the air, muttering, \\"I've been... defeated... by performers? This isn't over... Wario will return!\\" With the box now sufficiently shaken and stirred from inside and out, the cardboard prison fell apart at the seams, and the citizens of Zootopia burst free. Judy and Nick dusted themselves off, looking mildly embarrassed. \\"Thanks for the out-of-the-box rescue,\\" Judy quipped, her smile carrying more relief than her joke. Buster tipped his hat. \\"No trouble at all, mate! After all, what's a city without a little drama and a lot of song?\\" Gunter added with a wink, \\"And perhaps Zootopia can make room for a few more performers?\\" As laughter and chatter filled the air, the Sing crew joined the Zootopian locals for an impromptu concert, where species of every kind came together to celebrate their newfound freedom—and the joyous power of song, dance, and unexpected heroes."},{"instruction":"Как сформулировать тему исследования темперамента людей?","output":"\\"Исследование взаимосвязи между темпераментом и поведением людей\\""},{"instruction":"Какие факторы поведения людей связаны с темпераментом?","output":"Изучение факторов, связанных с темпераментом и их влияния на поведение людей"},{"instruction":"Какие факторы поведения людей связаны с темпераментом?","output":"Факторы поведения людей, связанные с темпераментом, могут включать: 1.

For example a 1N4007 verses a microwave oven diode","output":"Diodes come in a variety of sizes and specifications, and the appropriate size for your specific application depends on the requirements of that circuit. For general-purpose applications, a diode like the 1N4007 is often sufficient. It is a standard power diode with a maximum forward current rating of 1A and a voltage rating of 1,000V. It is commonly used for rectification in power supplies and other low to medium power applications. On the other hand, microwave oven diodes are designed specifically for high-power applications, such as in microwave ovens, where they are used for high voltage rectification. These diodes are typically much larger and have higher current and voltage ratings, such as several kilovolts and several amperes. Using a higher-rated diode might provide additional safety margins, but it can also increase the cost and size of your circuit unnecessarily. It is generally advisable to choose a diode that meets or slightly exceeds the requirements of your circuit, rather than going for overkill. This ensures the optimal performance and cost-effectiveness of your design."},{"instruction":"What about Scottish diodes what is different or better about them","output":"I apologize, but as an AI language model, I am not aware of any specific category of \\"Scottish diodes.\\" It's possible that you might be referring to a specific brand or type of diode, but I don't have any information on that.

You are referring to Schottky diodes. Schottky diodes are a specific type of diode that have some distinct characteristics compared to regular PN-junction diodes. Here are a few key differences and advantages of Schottky diodes: 1. Low voltage drop: Schottky diodes have a lower voltage drop (typically around 0.15-0.45V) compared to PN-junction diodes (typically around 0.6-0.7V). This lower voltage drop results in less power loss and improved efficiency in certain applications. 2. Fast switching speed: Schottky diodes have a faster switching capability due to their lower forward voltage drop and reduced capacitance. This makes them suitable for high-frequency and high-speed applications. 3. Low reverse recovery time: Schottky diodes have very low reverse recovery time compared to PN-junction diodes, which means they can quickly turn off and switch between conducting and non-conducting states. This makes them useful in rectification circuits and other applications where fast switching is required. 4. Higher temperature tolerance: Schottky diodes generally have a higher maximum operating temperature compared to regular diodes, which makes them suitable for use in high-temperature environments. Schottky diodes find applications in various areas such as power supplies, rectifiers, voltage clamping, and switching circuits. However, it's important to note that Schottky diodes are not suitable for all applications, especially those requiring high voltage handling or precise reverse recovery characteristics. I hope this clarifies the differences and advantages of Schottky diodes for you!"},{"instruction":"Are they good as a snubber diode for a flyback primary","output":"Schottky diodes can be suitable as snubber diodes for a flyback converter primary side, depending on the specific requirements of your application. Snubber diodes are used to suppress voltage spikes and protect electronic components from potentially damaging high voltage transients. When selecting a snubber diode for a flyback converter primary side, you typically want a diode with fast switching characteristics, low forward voltage drop, and good reverse recovery behavior. Schottky diodes are known for their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, making them viable options for snubber diode applications. However, it's important to consider the voltage and current ratings of the flyback converter, as well as the energy dissipation requirements. An appropriate Schottky diode should have voltage and current ratings that exceed the expected levels in your circuit to ensure reliable and safe operation. Additionally, consider the power dissipation capability of the diode to avoid overheating. It is always recommended to consult the datasheet and application notes from the diode manufacturer to ensure you choose a suitable snubber diode for your specific flyback converter design."},{"instruction":"Please write the prologue of the moment when the Zepherians attacked the earth. Please add some brutal drama. It was 2221. Akari and Haruto were young children back then. Please describe how they hid in a shelter during every raid by enemy ships. Akari’s father was the head of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces military base. His base was the first to take the fight to enemy ships. Akari’s mother was an experienced pilot. Haru’s parents were important scientists under the government and it was they who noticed and predicted the alien invasion, but it was too late. Please describe the moment when Haruto’s parents died protecting him and Akari. Please add dramatic dialogues.","output":"Prologue: When the Stars Descended in Fury It was the year 2221, and Earth's sky, once a celestial canvas of serenity, had become a theatre of terror. The Zepherians, a name whispered with dread even by those who'd only heard it moments before their obliteration, descended upon our world with a rage befitting the gods of old. Their ships cut through the sky like malignant meteors, their weapons howled like the winds of a planet scorned. Akari and Haruto were only children when the skies bled and the Zepherians ravaged Earth. The humming alarms were their lullabies, the vibrations of distant explosions, their cradle. They knew the cool, sterile air of underground shelters better than the warmth of the sun. Every raid by the enemy ships forced them deeper into the bowels of desolation, where fear and shadows became their kin. Nature bore silent witness to the tapestry of destruction above, and beneath, in a shelter, two small hearts beat in unison - pitter-patter rhythms of life against the drumming of war. Akari, silent and observant, clutched a small, weathered toy her father had given her, a memento from a time when her worries had been small enough to fit into the palms of her hands. Her father—General Yamamoto, the steely head of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces military base—stood at the vanguard of humanity's resistance. From the first shriek of alien engines, his base had risen like a singular flame against the dark tide. Her mother, soaring the skies in defiance, was an experienced pilot, her jet a fleeting glint under the siege from above. They would often say she was born from the stars—how cruel was fate that the stars now sought to claim her back! Haruto's eyes, twin orbs of determination, harbored an unsettling stillness. His parents, esteemed scientists who foresaw the calamity too late, whispered fervent apologies as their calculations became a reality. It was they who sheltered more than minds within this sanctuary of knowledge and steel—they protected hope itself. The day of ultimate loss was writ in the seared skies and scorched earth. A dire warning over the comm systems sent a chill colder than the concrete walls that attempted to shield them. \\"They’re breaching the atmosphere! Direct course to your sector!\\" The voice crackled, a harbinger of the inevitable. Haruto’s parents, Dr. Kenji and Dr. Yuna Watanabe, embraced their children, eyes brimming with the bitter gall of preordained sacrifice. \\"Akari, Haruto—listen to me,\\" Dr. Yuna spoke urgently, her voice as steady as her trembling hands. \\"Hold onto each other. Do not let go.\\" \\"But, Mama, where will you go?\\" Akari's voice broke the silent resolve that had shielded her young heart. \\"To ensure you see tomorrow,\\" Dr. Kenji replied, the weight of galaxies in his somber gaze. The earth shook as the monstrous roar of another blast shattered the fragile peace. As the wall before them ripped apart, Haruto's parents stood between their children and destiny's maw. \\"No, not you too! Please!\\" Haruto cried out, his hands desperately reaching, grabbing only empty air. The last thing the children saw was the silhouette of their protectors, backlit by a calamitous blaze, as they enacted a shield born of flesh and blood. A silent explosion of light embraced the figures of their parents, and then—darkness. \\"I love you, always,\\" echoed Dr. Yuna's voice in memory, lost amidst the cacophony of war. They were alone now, Akari and Haruto, in the depths of a shelter that felt more like a tomb. The only sound was the staccato pounding of enemy fire, and the silent, screaming void where once there had been love, parental warmth, and the promise of a future. In that moment, beneath the dying light of their world, beneath the storm of a wrathful cosmos, in hushed whimpers and silent vows, two children became more than survivors; they became the last ember of defiance against the night."},{"instruction":"在自变量趋于无穷时，两个数列之差等于零可以说明两个数列极限相等吗","output":"在自变量趋于无穷时，两个数列之差等于零不能直接说明两个数列的极限相等。这是因为两个数列之差等于零只表示它们在无穷之前的某个点上的数值相等，而并不表示它们在无穷时的极限相等。 要判断两个数列的极限是否相等，需要进行更严格的数学证明。一种常见的方法是利用数列极限的定义，通过证明两个数列的极限定义相等，即对于任意给定的正数ε，存在正整数N，使得当n>N时，两个数列的值差的绝对值小于ε。只有在通过严格的数学证明后，才能得出两个数列极限相等的结论。"},{"instruction":"write me a 4 point sentence outline about pharmaceuticals","output":"I.

Проверьте, что при изменении чаров вызывается метод \`UpdateItemIcon\`: \`\`\`csharp // В методе отвечающем за изменение чар, после того как чары изменены, должно быть вызвано обновление иконки public void UpdateEnchantmentComboBox(ComboBox enchantmentComboBox, int level, ListViewItem listViewItem = null) { // ... // После обновления списка чаров и их выбора enchantmentComboBox.SelectedIndex = 0; // Обновление чаров в объекте Item и обновление иконки int newCharm = int.TryParse(enchantmentComboBox.SelectedItem.ToString(), out int charmValue) ? charmValue : 0; if (listViewItem?.Tag is Item selectedItem) { selectedItem.Charms = newCharm; // Обновляем чары в объекте Item UpdateItemIcon(listViewItem, selectedItem); // Обновляем иконку элемента в ListView } // ... } \`\`\` 3. Удостоверьтесь, что метод \`ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged\`, обрабатывающий изменение уникального ComboBox (не тот, что отвечает за уровень), тоже обновляет иконку: \`\`\`csharp private void ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { // ... // После обновления текста subitem со значением из ComboBox if (listViewItem.Tag is Item selectedItem) { // Вы можете обновить уровень или чар здесь, если это необходимо сделать до обновления иконки UpdateItemIcon(listViewItem, selectedItem); } // ... } \`\`\` Убедитесь, что каждый раз, когда вы изменяете \`Level\` или \`Charms\` в объекте \`Item\`, вы также вызываете \`UpdateItemIcon\`, чтобы обновить картинку на основе этих изменений."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The unaffected father would have a genotype of XY, where X represents the normal copy of the X chromosome without the hemophilia gene, and Y represents the Y chromosome. The mother being a carrier means she carries one normal X chromosome (X) and one X chromosome with the hemophilia gene (Xh). Consequently, her genotype would be X Xh. Constructing a Punnett square with the father's XY genotype and the mother's X Xh genotype, we get the following: X Xh ------------------- X | XX X Xh Y | XY XY Xh This Punnett square demonstrates the possible genotypes of their offspring.

Discuss whether you agree with the proposition with examples of leadership challenges faced by modern corporations.","output":"I agree with the proposition that the identification of transformational or transactional leadership modes is significant in identifying the right leaders to face the challenges of the changing world. Both leadership styles have their own merits and can be effective in different situations. However, in the modern corporate landscape, where the challenges are diverse and continuously evolving, transformational leadership tends to be more advantageous. Transformational leadership is characterized by leaders who inspire, motivate, and intellectually stimulate their followers. They focus on long-term goals and foster innovation, creativity, and change. In contrast, transactional leadership is characterized by leaders who provide rewards and punishments based on performance and adherence to rules and procedures. In today's rapidly changing business environment, corporations face various challenges that require leaders who can adapt, inspire, and drive innovation. Let's consider a few examples: 1. Technological Disruption: In today's digital age, organizations need leaders who can understand and embrace emerging technologies. Transformational leaders can inspire their teams to embrace and leverage new technologies to stay ahead of the competition. They encourage a culture of continuous learning and innovation, fostering creativity and adaptability to navigate the ever-changing technological landscape. 2. Global Competition: With increasing globalization, corporations face intense competition from both domestic and international rivals. Transformational leaders can help organizations become more competitive by encouraging a global mindset, empowering employees to think and act globally. They inspire teams to embrace diversity, foster cross-cultural collaboration, and adapt to different markets, allowing companies to expand their reach and stay ahead in the global marketplace. 3. Uncertainty and Crisis Management: The modern business environment is prone to uncertainties and unexpected crises, such as economic downturns, natural disasters, or pandemics. Transformational leaders excel in such situations by communicating a clear vision, providing reassurance, and inspiring confidence. They motivate employees to pull together, adapt quickly, and find innovative solutions to overcome challenges, enabling the organization to recover and thrive in difficult times. 4. Ethical Leadership: In an era where ethical issues and corporate social responsibility are significant concerns, transformational leadership plays a crucial role. These leaders emphasize ethical behavior, social responsibility, and sustainability in their decision-making processes. They inspire teams to prioritize ethical considerations, build trust with stakeholders, and establish a positive reputation for the organization. While transactional leadership can also be effective in certain contexts, such as stable and predictable environments with a focus on efficiency, the challenges faced by modern corporations often require transformational leadership attributes. Therefore, identifying leaders with transformational qualities becomes crucial in navigating the complexities of the changing world."},{"instruction":"what is opset version","output":"Opset version refers to the version of the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) operator set that is supported by a specific version of the ONNX framework.

The opset version determines the set of operators and their behavior that a framework or tool can support when importing or exporting models in the ONNX format."},{"instruction":"BTS's fake love lyrics had the word Niga, which means you in Korean, and it was said that this was racist, so in the US concert they changed the lyrics and sang the song. What is your opinion on this?","output":"As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide context for the situation you've described. The word \\"니가\\" (niga) is a common Korean pronoun that translates to \\"you\\" in English. In the context of the BTS song \\"Fake Love,\\" it's used linguistically appropriate and is in no way intended to be offensive. However, without knowledge of Korean, an English speaker might misinterpret the sound as an offensive racial slur due to their phonetic similarity. In the case of BTS or any other artist adjusting their lyrics or performance to be sensitive to the audience's perspectives and prevent misunderstandings, it could be viewed as a proactive measure of cultural sensitivity. When artists perform internationally, they often take into account local cultures, languages, norms, and potential misunderstandings that might arise due to language differences. In the case of altering the pronunciation or lyrics during a concert, they might have done so to ensure that the message of the song wasn't lost or misconstrued by the audience, and to prevent offense, even if unintended. The decision to do so could be seen as a respectful gesture towards the audience and a means to maintain the inclusive and positive atmosphere that many artists strive for in their performances. It's important to recognize that these decisions can be complex and context-dependent, balancing artistic integrity with cultural sensitivity. Reactions to these adjustments can also vary widely, with some people appreciating the effort to be considerate, while others may view it as unnecessary."},{"instruction":"We are settling in well in Georgia, or we are settling in nicely in Georgia - which sounds better for American English and grammar?","output":"Both \\"We are settling in well in Georgia\\" and \\"We are settling in nicely in Georgia\\" are grammatically correct and commonly used in American English.

The world had not anticipated such brutality, such voracious hunger for dominance as displayed by the alien horde. Tokyo, a metropolis once pulsing with life, faced the first wrath of fire and ferocity that descended from the heavens. It was amidst this maelstrom that innocence was marred – the innocence of two children, Akari and Haruto. Akari, with cherry-blossom hair that danced in the tremulous air, was scarcely nine and knew nothing of war. Her father, a man of steel and valor, commanded the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, his base transformed overnight into the vanguard of Earth's resistance. He cast a hopeful gaze at the skies, a hopeful defense against the scourge, as the Zepherian dreadnaughts loomed like dark omens. His wife, Akari's mother, soared through hostility, her aircraft slicing the clouds, a tireless comet battling a storm of chaos. Haruto, only a year Akari's senior, bore witness to his parents' grim determination. Two of Earth's finest scientists, they had uncovered the telltale signs of impending doom, whispering predictions that fell on deaf ears until silence was shattered by war cries. With foreheads marred by the weight of regret and eyes reflecting a lament too profound for tears, they endeavored to reverse the fate they had forespoken. Scarred by the wails of sirens and the sky's agonized glow, Akari and Haruto sought solace in the underbelly of the city, a shelter that hummed with the heartbeats of the fearful and the hopeless. With every bombardment that shook the foundations of their sanctuary, every quiver that traveled through concrete and steel, Akari cupped her ears in a futile attempt to silence the war. Her trembling body a testament to a child's vulnerable soul in the unforgiving throes of cataclysm. \\"Haruto,\\" she whispered, her voice drowned by the cacophony of destruction, \\"Will the stars ever look the same again?\\" With a composure that sought to belie his years, Haruto wrapped an arm around her, his eyes fixed on the shaking walls that shielded them. \\"They will shine for us once more, Akari. They must.\\" In the darkest hours, as the city groaned and gasped under the relentless assault, Haruto's parents made the ultimate sacrifice. The very day a Zepherian strike sunk its talons into the heart of the sanctuary, they stood steadfast between death and the two trembling souls they had come to protect. \\"Kazuo, they’re just children!\\" Haruto's mother, Mio, cried out as an enemy shard bore down upon them, its luminous precipice promising annihilation. \\"With every breath, we guard their tomorrow!\\" Kazuo, resolute as he pushed his son and Akari behind the impenetrable doors of a secured vault, his voice a fortress in itself. As conniving fate would have it, the brilliance of their love burned too fiercely against the creeping shadow. In the final moments before the doors sealed shut, Haruto glimpsed the unyielding courage in his parents' eyes - a courage that bore the indelible mark of love and sacrifice. \\"We love you, Haruto. Remember us...\\" Mio's words echoed as the vault's doors clanged shut, a barricade against the inevitable. Amidst an explosion that ripped through the earth and sky, silencing brave hearts and blinding bright minds, two young souls clung to each other in the darkness, not fully grasping the torrents of grief that would wash over them in the wakes to come. Seasons would pass, the scars would mend, but the memory of that day, the day the Zepherians razed their world, would etch an undying resolve in Akari and Haruto, binding them beyond the reach of time, in the silent vow of reclamation and retribution."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Evaluate the importance of the stated qualifications for strategic leader and illustrate with example of such leader with whom you are familiar with.","output":"The qualifications of being a transformational leader, capable of solving wicked problems, and focused on doing the right rather than just doing things right are crucial for an effective strategic leader. Let's evaluate the importance of these qualifications and provide an example. 1. Transformational Leadership: A transformational leader inspires and motivates their team to achieve excellence, fosters innovation, and encourages personal growth. They have a clear vision, communicate effectively, and empower others to contribute towards organizational goals. This qualification is important because it creates a positive work environment and allows teams to adapt to change and embrace new opportunities. Example: Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is a well-known transformational leader. He has revolutionized the electric car industry with Tesla, and the space exploration industry with SpaceX. Musk's vision and charisma have motivated his employees to work towards disruptive innovation, ultimately transforming the automotive and space industries. 2. Solving Wicked Problems: Wicked problems are complex, ambiguous, and don't have straightforward solutions. A strategic leader has the ability to analyze these problems from multiple perspectives, think strategically, and develop creative solutions. This qualification is important as it enables leaders to navigate uncertain environments and make informed decisions. Example: Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, is a strategic leader who has tackled wicked problems. Under his leadership, Microsoft successfully shifted its focus towards cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Nadella displayed the ability to anticipate market shifts and led the company through a transformational period, navigating the complex landscape of technological advancements. 3. Doing the Right Things: Strategic leaders prioritize doing the right things over simply doing things right. They align their actions and decisions with ethical principles, organizational values, and long-term sustainability. This qualification is important because leaders must consider the broader impact of their decisions and ensure they are aligned with the organization's purpose and values. Example: Paul Polman, the former CEO of Unilever, exemplifies a leader who prioritized doing the right things. Under his leadership, Unilever focused on sustainable business practices, social responsibility, and environmental conservation. Polman's commitment to creating a positive impact led to Unilever being recognized as a global leader in sustainability and ethical business practices. In conclusion, the qualifications of being a transformational leader, capable of solving wicked problems, and focused on doing the right things are crucial for strategic leaders. These qualifications enable leaders to inspire and motivate their teams, make informed decisions in complex environments, and prioritize ethical practices and long-term sustainability. Real-world examples like Elon Musk, Satya Nadella, and Paul Polman demonstrate the importance of these qualifications in driving organizational success and positive change."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Как я могу помочь тебе сегодня?"},{"instruction":"самая опасная уязвимость это переполнение буфера?","output":"Переполнение буфера (buffer overflow) действительно является одной из самых опасных и известных уязвимостей в компьютерной безопасности. Этот вид атаки возникает, когда данные записываются за пределы выделенного для них области памяти (буфера), перезаписывая прилегающую память, что может привести к неопределенному поведению программы, включая исполнение произвольного кода атакующим. Однако современные системы обладают множеством механизмов защиты от таких атак, таких как: 1. **NX bit (No-eXecute bit) или DEP (Data Execution Prevention)**: Предотвращает выполнение кода в областях памяти, которые предназначены только для данных. 2. **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)**: Случайным образом изменяет расположение областей памяти программ при каждом запуске, что делает трудным предсказание места, куда следует вставить вредоносный код. 3. **Canary values (Стековые канарейки)**: Специальные значения, размещаемые в стеке перед возвращаемым адресом для обнаружения переписывания стека. 4. **StackGuard и ProPolice и другие компиляторы со встроенной защитой**: Используют различные методы для защиты от переполнения буфера при компиляции программ. Помимо переполнения буфера существуют и другие критические уязвимости, например: - SQL инъекции, позволяющие атакующим манипулировать запросами к базам данных. - Кросс-сайтовые скриптинг (XSS) атаки, при которых атакующий может внедрять вредоносные скрипты на веб-страницы. - Кросс-сайтовая подделка запросов (CSRF), которая может заставлять веб-приложение выполнять нежелательные действия от имени пользователя. - Некорректная обработка пользовательских вводов, ведущая к различным формам уязвимостей. - Ненадежные процессы аутентификации и авторизации, создающие потенциальные «дыры» в безопасности системы. Опасность уязвимости определяется не только тем, насколько легко ее можно эксплуатировать, но и потенциальным ущербом, который может быть нанесен в случае успешной атаки."},{"instruction":"я про уязвимости именно в ОС и ПО а не сайтов","output":"Да, переполнение буфера является серьёзной уязвимостью и в контексте операционных систем и прикладного программного обеспечения, поскольку это может привести к выполнению произвольного кода с правами той программы или процесса, в котором произошло переполнение. Кроме переполнения буфера, в операционных системах и программном обеспечении существуют и другие типы уязвимостей, включая, но не ограничиваясь: - Use-after-free: Когда программа пытается использовать память после того, как она была освобождена, что может привести к выполнению произвольного кода или краху программы. - Race condition: Уязвимость, возникающая из-за неправильной работы с ресурсами, когда несколько процессов выполняются одновременно, и результат их выполнения зависит от неопределенного порядка событий. - Дефекты в разграничении привилегий: Например, когда приложение или сервис работает с повышенными привилегиями, и атакующий может этим воспользоваться для выполнения произвольного кода. - Некорректная обработка входных данных: Аналогично переполнению буфера, это может привести к неожиданному поведению программы, к примеру, нарушение целостности памяти. Для уменьшения риска эксплуатации уязвимостей, разработчики и производители ОС и ПО обычно применяют 다лекие меры, как уже было упомянуто выше, а также выпускают регулярные обновления безопасности для устранения известных уязвимостей.

Однако, вот ключевые пункты, которые следует учитывать при разработке безопасного ПО: # Основы безопасности кода: 1. **Валидация входных данных:** Всегда проверяйте, фильтруйте и очищайте входные данные, чтобы предотвратить инъекции и другие виды атак. 2. **Принцип наименьших привилегий:** Предоставляйте программам только те права, которые необходимы для их функционирования. 3. **Хранение паролей и секретов:** Используйте надежные алгоритмы хеширования и соль для паролей. Храните секреты (ключи шифрования, токены доступа) отдельно от кода и базовой конфигурации. # Принципы разработки: 4. **Сегрегация кода:** Изолируйте критические компоненты программы и процессы. 5. **Минимизация атакующей поверхности:** Старайтесь уменьшить количество функций и сервисов, доступных для пользователя или сети. 6. **Контроль доступа:** Реализуйте эффективный контроль доступа, обеспечивающий разграничение доступа и проверку полномочий. # Контроль ошибок и исключений: 7. **Обработка ошибок:** Пишите безопасные обработчики ошибок, которые не раскрывают слишком много информации и не прерывают выполнение важных процессов. 8. **Логирование действий:** Регистрируйте важные события безопасности, но избегайте записи конфиденциальной информации в логи. # Проверка и тестирование кода: 9. **Код-ревью:** Регулярно проводите проверку кода со стороны других разработчиков. 10. **Тестирование:** Тщательно тестируйте программное обеспечение на поиск ошибок и уязвимостей (юнит-тесты, интеграционные, нагрузочные и проникновения). # Следование стандартам и обновления: 11. **Следование стандартам:** Применяйте лучшие практики и стандарты разработки, такие как OWASP Top 10, CWE/SANS Top 25 и другие. 12. **Обновления:** Регулярно обновляйте используемые библиотеки и зависимости до последних безопасных версий. # Архитектурные соображения: 13. **Инкапсуляция:** Тщательно проектируйте архитектуру ПО, чётко разделяя компоненты и используя инкапсуляцию для снижения влияния потенциальных уязвимостей. 14. **Безопасный по умолчанию:** Конфигурации и установки должны быть максимально безопасными \\"из коробки\\". # Обучение и осведомлённость: 15. **Обучение разработчиков:** Развивайте осведомлённость о безопасности среди команды разработчиков. 16. **Отслеживание уязвимостей:** Следите за известными уязвимостями в используемом ПО и операционной системе. Это лишь основы, и в качестве разработчика следует постоянно обновлять знания в области безопасного кодирования, следить за трендами в кибербезопасности и углублять понимание того, как могут быть эксплуатированы различные виды уязвимостей.

Конфиденциальная информация может включать в себя: 1. **Пароли или хеши паролей:** Запись паролей или их хешей в логи может предоставить ненужный доступ несанкционированным лицам, если логи станут публичными или попадут в руки злоумышленников. 2. **Данные сессии:** Идентификаторы сессии или токены доступа, которые могут быть использованы для фальсификации сессии пользователя. 3. **Личная идентификационная информация (ЛИИ):** Данные, которые могут идентифицировать личность пользователя, такие как ФИО, адрес, номер телефона, номера кредитных карт, социального страхования и т.д. 4. **Данные конфигурации системы:** Например, ключи API, ключи шифрования, пароли от баз данных и другие настройки, которые могут быть использованы для компрометации системы. 5. **Детали сообщений об ошибках:** Подробные сообщения об ошибках могут выдавать информацию о структуре системы, используемом программном обеспечении и потенциальных способах эксплуатации уязвимостей. Чтобы предотвратить утечку конфиденциальной информации через логи, важно: - Использовать маскировку или удаление чувствительных данных перед их записью в логи. - Разграничивать доступ к логам, обеспечивать их защиту и шифрование. - Тщательно настраивать системы логирования, чтобы они записывали только необходимую для отладки и мониторинга информацию."},{"instruction":"ты говорил про постоянно новые уязвимости. но если это моя программа и я её разработчик то я смогу устранить все уязвимости которые найду и новые будут только когда я буду писать обновления","output":"Ваше предположение частично верно. Как разработчик, вы можете исправить все известные в момент тестирования и ревью уязвимости. Однако есть несколько факторов, которые следует учесть: 1. **Сложность программного обеспечения:** Чем сложнее программа, тем выше шанс того, что в ней остались необнаруженные уязвимости. Со временем их можно обнаружить, например, используя более продвинутые методы тестирования или анализа. 2. **Изменяющаяся угроза:** То, что считается безопасным сегодня, может стать уязвимым завтра. Новые методы атак открываются регулярно, и то, что не было уязвимостью в момент релиза, может стать ею позже. 3. **Зависимости от сторонних библиотек и компонентов:** Может случиться так, что уязвимость будет обнаружена в использованных вами сторонних библиотеках или компонентах, на которые вы не имеете прямого влияния. 4. **Изменения в окружении:** Обновления операционной системы, компиляторов, интерпретаторов и других систем, с которыми взаимодействует ваша программа, также могут привести к появлению новых уязвимостей. 5. **Человеческий фактор:** Как и любая сложная система, ПО подвержено ошибкам, которые могут быть не замечены во время разработки, неважно, насколько опытен программист. 6. **Обнаружение уязвимостей:** Можно не заметить сложные уязвимости на этапе тестирования, которые позже обнаружат пользователи, исследователи безопасности или злоумышленники. Именно поэтому процесс обеспечения безопасности программного обеспечения не заканчивается после его первоначальной разработки и релиза. Поддержка безопасности продукта включает в себя постоянное наблюдение за новыми уязвимостями, регулярные обновления и патчи, а также оперативное реагирование на обнаруженные проблемы."},{"instruction":"про второй пункт я не понял. ну как это завтра? например. алгоритмы шифрования надёжны на миллиарды лет. они надёжны. не завтра не после завтра их не взломают","output":"Да, многие алгоритмы современного шифрования разработаны таким образом, чтобы их было практически невозможно взломать с помощью современных технологий — например, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) считается надежным и должен защитить данные в течение долгого времени при условии использования достаточно длинного ключа. Тем не менее, моя фраза о том, что \\"то, что считается безопасным сегодня, может стать уязвимым завтра\\" относится не столько к криптографии, сколько к общему принципу в области информационной безопасности. Вот некоторые из возможных сценариев, когда сегодняшняя безопасность может быть под угрозой завтра: 1. **Прогресс в вычислительной технике:** Квантовые компьютеры, достигающие практической зрелости в будущем, могут нарушить безопасность большинства современных криптографических систем за счет способности быстро разлагать на множители большие числа и решать задачу дискретного логарифмирования. 2. **Криптоаналитический прорыв:** Теоретические открытия в области криптоанализа могут выявить неизвестные до сих пор слабые места в существующих алгоритмах. 3. **Ошибки реализации:** Даже самые сильные криптографические алгоритмы могут быть неправильно реализованы в программном обеспечении, что делает их уязвимыми не из-за теоретических недостатков алгоритма, а из-за ошибок в программировании. 4. **Изменения в нормативно-правовой среде:** Новые законы и регуляции могут требовать изменения в подходах к шифрованию или безопасности данных. 5. **Изменение модели угроз:** Со временем модель угроз эволюционирует. Например, появление нового вида атак может потребовать изменения в применяемых методах защиты данных. Это не значит, что каждый день появляются способы взлома сильных криптографических систем, но информационная безопасность — это динамичная область, где новые угрозы и вызовы возникают постоянно. Поэтому важно быть готовым к неожиданностям и регулярно пересматривать принятые меры безопасности."},{"instruction":"язык комедии Грибоедова","output":"Язык комедии Грибоедова – русский язык, отображающий особенности общества и культуры России в первой половине XIX века.

Полевым этот этап называется потому, что он проводится в естественных условиях, отличных от лабораторных, т.е. тех, в которых преимущественно проходила предыдущая исследовательская работа. 2 слайд - Данный этап начинается с подготовки команды, способной грамотно пользоваться исследовательскими инструментами. Ради экономии времени, формирование штаба технических работников (кодировщиков, анкетеров, интервьюеров и других) ведется, как правило, параллельно с пилотажем инструментов. Поэтому непосредственные полевые работы начинаются с итогового инструктажа исполнителей исследования, вооружения их должными инструментами и индивидуальными заданиями, их прибытия в поле – места сбора информации. Полевой этап требует значительного времени. Параметры временных затрат заданы выборкой, сложностью инструментов, количеством сборщиков информации, а также производительностью и качественностью их труда. Особое внимание заслуживает проблема качественности сбора данных, в т.ч. и прежде всего, общения исполнителей полевых работ с обследуемыми людьми. Если анкетер или интервьюер не сможет расположить к себе респондентов, то ответы последних не будут в полной мере адекватными их действительным мнениям. Тоже произойдет, если интервьюер покажется респонденту заинтересованным в получении ответов определенного толка. Еще хуже, когда проводящие опросы или групповые дискуссии, таким образом, подсказывают ответы (или реагируют на услышанное от обследуемых), что фактически навязывают им свое мнение. Все это искажает истину, снижает валидность исследования, перечеркивает все ранее проведенную работу. Поэтому обязательным условием полевых работ выступает контроль за качеством труда технических работников. 3 слайд - Полевые исследования осуществляются по заранее составленным планам-графикам, обеспечивающим четкость и своевременность исполнения отдельных операций и индивидуальных заданий. Но эти планы-графики не отменяют естественной сложности полевых работ, выражающейся в потребности одновременного решения многих задач. В их числе: • оперативный контроль за качеством деятельности сборщиков информации • учет проделанной ими работы; • прием заполненных документов, тщательная проверка каждого из них; • кодирование полученной информации; • хранение документации, обеспечивающее соблюдение исследовательской тайны; • проведение контрольных (повторных) обследований; • оперативная помощь исполнителям; • ежедневное подведение итогов работы, обеспечение исполнения плана-графика; • систематическое общение с заказчиком, руководителями тех административно-территориальных единиц или трудовых коллективов, где проводится полевое исследование. Выполнение последней операции осложняется необходимостью соблюдения исследовательской тайны. Вышеназванные лица, как правило, хотят знать, что думают о них конкретные люди, каким образом ответили, скажем, не вопросы анкеты Иванов или Петров. Если производители полевых работ удовлетворят это понятное желание, то нарушат профессиональный кодекс социолога. 4 слайд - Исследования призваны не осложнять отношения людей, а улучшать, облагораживать их. Их результаты сообщаются заинтересованным лицам, в т.ч. заказчику, в обобщенном виде, как отражение общественного мнения, а не мнений конкретных индивидов. К сожалению, многие либо не знают этой истины, либо провоцируют ее нарушение (иногда, даже путем прямого подкупа социологов, т.е. должностного преступления последних). Кроме того, следует учитывать, что полевые работы дают лишь первичную информацию. Она может существенно трансформироваться на последующих этапах исследования. В этой связи социологам нельзя выдавать свои предварительные впечатления за итоги работы, а заказчикам следует дожидаться окончательных результатов, прежде, чем предпринимать какие-то меры. На полевом этапе социологи нуждаются в помощи заказчиков, руководителей территорий и коллективов, обращаются к ним за содействием по ряду организационных вопросов (по поводу выделения им комнаты, телефона и т.п.) Удовлетворение просьб такого рода не дает права вмешиваться в ход полевых социологических работ, что, к сожалению, порой случается, ведет к ломке замыслов исследователей, снижает меру достоверности их заключений. \\"","output":"Вопрос: Что такое полевой этап социологического исследования и каковы его основные характеристики? Ответ: Полевой этап социологического исследования представляет собой время, когда проводятся массовые опросы, интервью, тестирования и наблюдения для сбора первичной социологической информации. Он отличается от предыдущего этапа исследования тем, что проводится в естественных условиях, а не в лабораторных.

Полевой этап требует значительного времени. Параметры временных затрат заданы выборкой, сложностью инструментов, количеством сборщиков информации, а также производительностью и качественностью их труда. Особое внимание заслуживает проблема качественности сбора данных, в т.ч. и прежде всего, общения исполнителей полевых работ с обследуемыми людьми. Если анкетер или интервьюер не сможет расположить к себе респондентов, то ответы последних не будут в полной мере адекватными их действительным мнениям. Тоже произойдет, если интервьюер покажется респонденту заинтересованным в получении ответов определенного толка. Еще хуже, когда проводящие опросы или групповые дискуссии, таким образом, подсказывают ответы (или реагируют на услышанное от обследуемых), что фактически навязывают им свое мнение. Все это искажает истину, снижает валидность исследования, перечеркивает все ранее проведенную работу. Поэтому обязательным условием полевых работ выступает контроль за качеством труда технических работников. 3 слайд - Полевые исследования осуществляются по заранее составленным планам-графикам, обеспечивающим четкость и своевременность исполнения отдельных операций и индивидуальных заданий. Но эти планы-графики не отменяют естественной сложности полевых работ, выражающейся в потребности одновременного решения многих задач. В их числе: • оперативный контроль за качеством деятельности сборщиков информации • учет проделанной ими работы; • прием заполненных документов, тщательная проверка каждого из них; • кодирование полученной информации; • хранение документации, обеспечивающее соблюдение исследовательской тайны; • проведение контрольных (повторных) обследований; • оперативная помощь исполнителям; • ежедневное подведение итогов работы, обеспечение исполнения плана-графика; • систематическое общение с заказчиком, руководителями тех административно-территориальных единиц или трудовых коллективов, где проводится полевое исследование. Выполнение последней операции осложняется необходимостью соблюдения исследовательской тайны. Вышеназванные лица, как правило, хотят знать, что думают о них конкретные люди, каким образом ответили, скажем, не вопросы анкеты Иванов или Петров. Если производители полевых работ удовлетворят это понятное желание, то нарушат профессиональный кодекс социолога. 4 слайд - Исследования призваны не осложнять отношения людей, а улучшать, облагораживать их. Их результаты сообщаются заинтересованным лицам, в т.ч. заказчику, в обобщенном виде, как отражение общественного мнения, а не мнений конкретных индивидов. К сожалению, многие либо не знают этой истины, либо провоцируют ее нарушение (иногда, даже путем прямого подкупа социологов, т.е. должностного преступления последних). Кроме того, следует учитывать, что полевые работы дают лишь первичную информацию. Она может существенно трансформироваться на последующих этапах исследования. В этой связи социологам нельзя выдавать свои предварительные впечатления за итоги работы, а заказчикам следует дожидаться окончательных результатов, прежде, чем предпринимать какие-то меры. На полевом этапе социологи нуждаются в помощи заказчиков, руководителей территорий и коллективов, обращаются к ним за содействием по ряду организационных вопросов (по поводу выделения им комнаты, телефона и т.п.) Удовлетворение просьб такого рода не дает права вмешиваться в ход полевых социологических работ, что, к сожалению, порой случается, ведет к ломке замыслов исследователей, снижает меру достоверности их заключений. ”","output":"Вопросы: 1. Что представляет собой полевой этап сбора социологической информации? 2. Как начинается полевой этап исследования? 3. Как влияет качество сбора данных на результаты исследования? 4. Какие задачи необходимо решить во время полевых работ? 5. Что следует учитывать при использовании результатов полевых исследований? Ответы: 1. Полевой этап представляет собой время сбора первичной социологической информации, проведение опросов, интервьюирований, тестирований, наблюдений и использование инструментов методик исследования. 2. Полевой этап начинается с подготовки команды исследователей, которые должны быть знакомы с инструментами исследования. Далее, происходит инструктаж исполнителей исследования, вооружение инструментами и индивидуальными заданиями, их прибытие на место сбора информации. 3. Качество сбора данных имеет важное значение, так как влияет на адекватность ответов респондентов и валидность исследования. Если исполнитель полевых работ не установит доверительные отношения с респондентами или навязывает свое мнение, результаты исследования могут быть искажены. 4. Во время полевых работ необходимо осуществлять оперативный контроль за качеством деятельности сборщиков информации, учитывать проделанную работу, прием заполненных документов, тщательно проверять каждый документ, кодирование информации, обеспечивать хранение документов и соблюдение исследовательской тайны, проводить контрольные обследования, оказывать оперативную помощь исполнителям и подводить итоги ежедневной работы. 5. Результаты полевых исследований должны быть представлены заказчику и другим заинтересованным лицам в обобщенном виде, как отражение общественного мнения, а не мнений конкретных индивидов. Полевые работы дают лишь первичную информацию, которая может измениться на последующих этапах исследования. Заказчикам следует дожидаться окончательных результатов, прежде, чем принимать решения."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Le barème indiqué pour chaque question n’est donné qu’à titre indicatif. Le barème total est lui aussi donné à titre indicatif : 30 points. En réponse à ce devoir, vous devez rendre sur le site Moodle un unique fichier contenant toutes les fonctions Python que vous avez écrites, accompagnées de leurs jeux de tests. Après avoir indiqué vos nom et prénom en commentaire en première ligne de votre programme, vous préciserez pour chaque fonction en commentaire, le nom de l’exercice et de la question correspondante. Les réponses à tous les exercices du devoir sont à écrire dans un même fichier. Important: pour les fonctions à écrire, il est nécessaire de donner une définition avec signature, hypothèse(s) éventuelle(s) et jeu de tests, mais il n’est pas nécessaire de donner la description. Une attention particulière est à apporter à l’efficacité des solutions proposées. Rappel : seules la grammaire, la syntaxe et les fonctions données dans le cours et rappelées dans la carte de référence sont autorisées dans vos solutions. Durée indicative : résoudre ce devoir doit prendre environ 2h. Exercice 1 : Itinéraires Cet exercice considère des itinéraires, définis comme des listes de couples, dont le premier élément est une chaîne de caractères qui vaut ’nord’, ’sud’, ’est’ ou ’ouest’ et le second élément est un nombre positif : ainsi, [(’nord’, 3.2),(’est’, 2.5),(’nord’, 4)] correspond à l’itinéraire qui consiste à faire 3.2km vers le nord, puis 2.5km vers l’est puis 4km vers le nord. Dans tout l’exercice, il n’est pas demandé de préciser en précondition les hypothèses sur les valeurs autorisées pour les chaînes de caractères ni sur les nombres qui constituent les couples. Question 1.1 [2/30] Donner une définition de la fonction resume qui, étant donné un itinéraire, renvoie un couple dont le premier élément donne le déplacement total qui est à effectuer vers le nord et le second élément donne le déplacement total qui est à effectuer vers l’est. On considère qu’un mouvement de x kilomètres vers le sud correspond à un déplacement négatif vers le nord, de valeur −x ; de même les mouvements vers l’ouest comptent négativement dans la direction vers l’est. Par exemple : >>> resume([(’nord’, 3.2),(’est’, 2.5),(’nord’, 4)]) (7.2, 2.5) >>> resume([(’sud’, 2)]) (-2, 0) ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 1 - >>> resume([]) (0, 0) Question 1.2 [2/30] Donner une définition de la fonction retour qui, étant donné un itinéraire, renvoie l’itinéraire correspondant au retour. Par exemple : >>> retour([(’nord’, 3.2),(’est’, 2.5),(’nord’, 4)]) [(’sud’,4),(’ouest’,2.5),(’sud’,3.2)] >>> retour([(’sud’, 2)]) [(’nord’, 2)] >>> retour([]) [] Exercice 2 : Typologie d’animaux Un dictionnaire de classification représente une classification d’animaux, qui associe à une chaîne de caractères donnant une catégorie, un ensemble de chaînes de caractères donnant des sous-catégories qui en font partie. Une sous-catégorie peut elle-même être considérée comme une catégorie quand elle peut être décomposée à son tour. Dans tout l’exercice, et sans qu’il soit nécessaire de le préciser en précondition, on fait l’hypothèse qu’une sous-catégorie n’apparaît pas dans plusieurs catégories. A titre d’exemple, on considère le dictionnaire Dclassif:Dict[str, Set[str]]= {’animal’:{’mammifere’, ’oiseau’}, ’mammifere’:{’chat’, ’chien’,’lapin’}, ’oiseau’:{’pigeon’, ’poule’}, ’chat’:{’chartreux’, ’bengale’, ’persan’}, ’chien’:{’chihuahua’,’bouledogue’,’labrador’,’lévrier’}} Question 2.1 [3/30] On appelle (abusivement) instances les catégories qui ne sont pas décomposées en souscatégories : pour Dclassif, les instances comprennent lapin, pigeon, poule, chartreux, bengale, persan, chihuahua, bouledogue, labrador, lévrier. Par contre animal, mammifere, oiseau, chat et chien ne sont pas des instances. Donner une définition de la fonction nb_instances qui, étant donné un dictionnaire de classification, renvoie le nombre d’instances qu’il contient. Par exemple : ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 2 - >>> nombre_instances(Dclassif) 10 Question 2.2 [5/30] Donner une définition de la fonction cat_max qui, étant donné un dictionnaire de classification, renvoie l’ensemble des catégories comptant le nombre maximal de sous-catégories. Par exemple : >>> cat_max(Dclassif) {’chien’} >>> cat_max(Dclassif_bis) {’chat’,’mammifere’} où Dclassif_bis est le dictionnaire Dclassif où on a enlevé les sous-catégories des chiens. Question 2.3 [5/30] Donner une définition de la fonction typologie qui, étant donné un dictionnaire de classification, renvoie un dictionnaire qui associe à chaque catégorie l’ensemble des catégories dont elle fait partie. Ainsi ’lapin’ doit être associé à l’ensemble {’mammifere’, ’animal’} et ’chihuahua’ à l’ensemble {’chien’,’mammifere’, ’animal’}. Le dictionnaire complet attendu en résultat est illustré ci-dessous Par exemple : >>> typologie(Dclassif) {’mammifere’:{’animal’}, ’oiseau’:{’animal’}, ’chat’: {’animal’, ’mammifere’}, ’chien’: {’animal’, ’mammifere’}, ’lapin’:{’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’pigeon’:{’oiseau’,’animal’}, ’poule’:{’oiseau’,’animal’}, ’chartreux’:{’chat’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’bengale’:{’chat’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’persan’:{’chat’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’chihuahua’:{’chien’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’bouledogue’:{’chien’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’labrador’:{’chien’,’mammifere’,’animal’}, ’lévrier’:{’chien’,’mammifere’,’animal’}} Dans la suite du devoir on appelle Dtypo = typologie(Dclassif) ce dictionnaire obtenu en résultat de l’application de la fonction typologie à Dclassif. En cas de difficulté pour répondre à la question, vous pouvez définir explicitement ce dictionnaire dans votre fichier, en recopiant le résultat donné ci-dessus, et définir une fonction ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 3 - typologie qui renvoie exactement ce dictionnaire, pour l’utiliser dans les questions suivantes et ne pas être bloqué. Question 2.4 [4/30] On considère maintenant un dictionnaire de caractéristiques, de même type qu’un dictionnaire de classification, qui donne pour certaines catégories des propriétés qu’elles possèdent : Dcaract:Dict[str, Set[str]]= {’animal’:{’respire’}, ’oiseau’:{’vole’,’oeuf’,’plumes’,’2pattes’}, ’mammifere’:{’poils’,’4pattes’}} Donner une définition de la fonction caracteristiques qui, étant donné une chaîne de caractères donnant le nom d’une catégorie, un dictionnaire de classification et un dictionnaire de caractéristiques, renvoie l’ensemble des caractéristiques possédées par la catégorie. Par exemple : >>> caracteristiques(’lapin’, Dclassif, Dcaract) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques(’chien’, Dclassif, Dcaract) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques(’labrador’, Dclassif, Dcaract) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques(’poule’, Dclassif, Dcaract) {’respire’, ’vole’,’oeuf’,’plumes’,’2pattes’} >>> caracteristiques(’vache’, Dclassif, Dcaract) set() Question 2.5 [3/30] On souhaite pouvoir traiter des exceptions, par exemples des oiseaux qui ne volent pas. On considère un autre dictionnaire de classification, qui inclut les autruches et les sphynx (qui sont des chats sans poils) : Dclassif2:Dict[str, Set[str]]= {’animal’:{’mammifere’, ’oiseau’}, ’mammifere’:{’chat’, ’chien’,’lapin’}, ’oiseau’:{’pigeon’, ’poule’,’autruche’}, ’chat’:{’chartreux’, ’bengale’, ’persan’,’sphynx’}, ’chien’:{’chihuahua’,’bouledogue’,’labrador’,’lévrier’}} On considère de plus un dictionnaire d’exceptions qui associe à des chaînes de caractères correspondant à des catégories d’un dictionnaire de classification, une chaîne de caractères précisant l’exception (on fait l’hypothèse simplificatrice qu’une catégorie ne peut présenter qu’une seule exception) : Dexc:Dict[str, str]= {’autruche’:’non_vole’, ’sphynx’:’non_poils’} ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 4 - Donner une définition de la fonction oppose qui, étant donné deux chaînes de caractères s1 et s2, renvoie le booléen True si l’une est égale à l’autre préfixée par ’non_’. Par exemple : >>> oppose(’non_vole’, ’vole’) True >>> oppose(’poils’, ’non_poils’) True >>> oppose(’non_vole’, ’non_poils’) False >>> oppose(’vole’, ’poils’) False Question 2.6 [3/30] Donner une définition de la fonction caracteristiques_exc qui, étant donné une chaîne de caractères donnant le nom d’une catégorie, un dictionnaire de classification, un dictionnaire de caractéristiques et un dictionnaire d’exceptions, renvoie l’ensemble des caractéristiques possédées par la catégorie considérée, en tenant compte des exceptions. Par exemple : >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’lapin’, Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’chien’,Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’labrador’, Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’, ’poils’,’4pattes’} >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’poule’,Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’, ’vole’,’oeuf’,’plumes’,’2pattes’} >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’vache’,Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) set() >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’autruche’,Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’, ’oeuf’,’plumes’,’2pattes’} >>> caracteristiques_exceptions(’sphynx’,Dclassif2, Dcaract, Dexc) {’respire’,’4pattes’} Question 2.7 [3/30] Donner une définition de la fonction compte qui, étant donné une chaîne de caractères cat correspondant à une catégorie, un ensemble S de couples contenant une chaîne de caractères et un entier et un dictionnaire de classification, renvoie le nombre de représentants de cat dans l’ensemble S. Par exemple, étant donné la variable ferme:Set[Tuple[str, int]] = {(\\"chat\\", 3), (\\"labrador\\", 1), (’lapin’, 4), (\\"poule\\", 8)} ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 5 - on doit avoir >>> compte(’chat’, ferme, Dclassif) 3 >>> compte(’chien’, ferme, Dclassif) 1 >>> compte(’mammifere’, ferme, Dclassif) 8 >>> compte(’animal’, ferme, Dclassif) 16 ©SU - Informatique - LU1IN001-EAD - page 6 -","output":"Je vais vous fournir des ébauches de solutions pour chaque question de votre devoir.

La relation entre la différence de potentiel (U), la puissance (P) et la résistance (R) est donnée par la formule de la puissance électrique : [ P = frac{U^2}{R} ] D'où on peut déduire la résistance pour chaque lampe alimentée directement à une tension de 200 V : [ R = frac{U^2}{P} ] Pour la première lampe (25 W) : [ R_{25} = frac{200^2}{25} ] Pour la deuxième lampe (60 W) : [ R_{60} = frac{200^2}{60} ] Pour la troisième lampe (100 W) : [ R_{100} = frac{200^2}{100} ] # Lorsqu’elles sont en série : 1.

En parallèle, chaque lampe recevra la même tension de 200V et la lampe avec la moindre résistance dissipera plus de puissance et sera donc la plus brillante.

The column values for each row are passed as a tuple \`query_values\`, and the \`execute()\` function handles the parameter binding. Make sure to adjust the table name \`Bin6_Fallout\` and the column names based on your specific table structure. Using parameter binding should help to avoid parsing errors related to datatypes and ensure that the data is properly inserted into the table."},{"instruction":"may be can you show me the logic to insert the data by row loop into mysql","output":"Certainly!

Они исследуют влияние социальной среды на формирование личности и ее характеристик. Личность (от лат. persona — актёрская маска) — это человеческий индивид, являющийся субъектом сознательной деятельности, обладающий совокупностью социально значимых черт, свойств и качеств, которые он реализует в общественной жизни. Основная часть: 1. Теория социальной интеграции: - Разработана Эмилем Дюркгеймом. - Утверждает, что личность формируется благодаря взаимодействию индивида с обществом. - Основное внимание уделяется процессу социализации и социальной адаптации. - Подчеркивает роль норм и ценностей, которые общество передает индивиду через социализацию. 2. Теория социального взаимодействия: - Разработана Джорджем Хербертом Мидом. - Утверждает, что личность формируется в результате взаимодействия с другими людьми. - Акцентирует внимание на ролевой теории и социальных нормах. - Личность рассматривается как активный участник социального процесса. 3. Теория символического взаимодействия: - Разработана Джорджем Хербертом Мидом. - Утверждает, что личность формируется на основе восприятия символов и значений, имеющихся в обществе. - Основное внимание уделяется интерпретации социальной реальности и созданию собственного смысла ситуаций. - Личность рассматривается как продукт искусственного обмена символами и коммуникации. Заключение: Социологические теории личности позволяют понять, как социальная среда влияет на формирование личности. Они помогают объяснить и предсказать поведение и характеристики индивидов в обществе. При изучении этих теорий важно учитывать контекст и культурные различия, которые могут влиять на процесс формирования личности.","output":"Умный вопрос: Какие основные аспекты формирования личности рассматриваются в социологических теориях?

Может ли быть взыскание для погашения задолженности обращено на легковой автомобиль?","output":"В российском законодательстве предприниматели без образования юридического лица (ПБОЮЛ), иначе известные как индивидуальные предприниматели (ИП), несут по своим обязательствам личную ответственность всем своим имуществом, за исключением имущества, на которое согласно законодательству не может быть обращено взыскание. Статья 446 Гражданского кодекса РФ определяет, что кредитор имеет право обратить взыскание на имущество должника, если должник не исполняет обязательство или исполняет его ненадлежащим образом. Поскольку Иванов И.И. действует как индивидуальный предприниматель, его личное имущество может быть использовано для погашения долгов, возникших в ходе предпринимательской деятельности. Согласно статье 446 Гражданского кодекса РФ, на некоторые виды имущества, такие как единственное жильё, предметы личного бытового назначения и иное имущество, указанное в законе, не может быть обращено взыскание. Также законодательство устанавливает пределы взыскания на заработную плату, пенсии и иные виды доходов граждан. Автомобиль, который не используется в предпринимательской деятельности Иванова И.И., в принципе может быть подвергнут принудительному взысканию, если не ограничено законодательством. Однако, если легковой автомобиль является единственным средством передвижения для Иванова и его семьи, и отсутствуют другие транспортные средства, возможны ограничения на обращение взыскания, основываясь на судебной практике и иных законодательных актах, защищающих права должников.

Initial Consultation: The service provider will conduct an initial consultation to understand your organization's specific requirements, existing security infrastructure, and goals for implementing EDR. 2. Pre-assessment: The provider may conduct a pre-assessment of your organization's current security posture to identify any vulnerabilities or gaps that need to be addressed before implementing EDR. 3. Planning and Design: Based on the information gathered during the initial consultation and pre-assessment, the provider will work with you to develop a customized plan and design for the EDR implementation. This may include defining the scope, selecting the appropriate EDR solution, establishing goals and objectives, and determining the required resources. 4. Deployment and Configuration: The provider will assist with the deployment and configuration of the EDR solution. This may involve installing endpoint agents on your organization's devices, integrating with existing security tools, and configuring policies and rules for monitoring and response. 5. Data Collection and Analysis: Once the EDR solution is deployed and configured, it will collect data from endpoint devices, such as logs, events, and behavioral information. The provider will analyze this data to identify potential security incidents, threats, or abnormal behaviors. 6. Incident Response and Remediation: When a security incident is detected, the EDR solution will trigger an alert to the service provider's security operations center (SOC). The SOC team will investigate the incident, validate its severity, and initiate a response plan to contain, mitigate, and remediate the threat. 7. Ongoing Monitoring and Support: The provider will continuously monitor your organization's endpoints for potential threats, proactively respond to alerts, and provide regular reports on security incidents, trends, and recommendations for improvement. They will also offer technical support and maintenance for the EDR solution. 8. Training and User Education: The provider may conduct training sessions and provide educational resources to help your organization's staff understand the EDR solution's capabilities, how to respond to alerts, and best practices for endpoint security. It is essential to note that the onboarding process may vary depending on the specific service provider and the complexity of your organization's security environment.

Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodworking should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family. To that extent do you agree or disagree? It is better schools just pay attention to the success of academic curricula and passing tests. There is no need to teach the talents like cookery, dressing and woodworking at school. It is beneficial family learns these to them. I absolutely agree because it can be waste of time especially at school. I hold the view that school’s time is extremely important because student’s mind is at the high level of capability to learn necessary and hard syllables such as math or biology. When they try to pass exams with excellent grades they carefully and completely learn those syllables as well. Also maybe child can be learn by parents or family practical things like dressmaking but it is not easier for every parents to learn their child academic curricula such as math or physics because they maybe do not have as adequate knowledge as teacher to learn these to their children. What is more, some activities like cookery or woodworking can be very dangerous for child. These activities need specific appliance like knife, logging saw, and scissor. All of these are risky to use by child. There are ten or fifteen students in every class at least so controlling all the things can be extremely tough to teacher. Also if something seriously happen during the class, the teacher and labors of school are responsible. However some people believe the activities like cookery or dressmaking should be taught to pupils at school. Maybe they believe these activities help students to enhance their creativity. Although the creativity of students have improved by these activity but if something serious happen the consequences are bad for children or their parents. I think it is better children are taught these activities by parents.
