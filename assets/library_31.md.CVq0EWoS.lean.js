Article: Not all bodies of water are so evidently alive as the Atlantic Ocean, an S-shaped body of water covering 33 million square miles. The Atlantic has, in a sense, replaced the Mediterranean as the inland sea of Western civilization. Unlike real inland seas, which seem strangely still, the Atlantic is rich in oceanic liveliness. It is perhaps not surprising that its vitality has been much written about by ancient poets. \\"Storm at Sea\\", a short poem written around 700, is generally regarded as one of mankind's earliest artistic representations of the Atlantic. When the wind is from the west All the waves that cannot rest To the east must thunder on Where the bright tree of the sun Is rooted in the ocean's breast. As the poem suggests, the Atlantic is never dead and dull. It is an ocean that moves, impressively and endlessly. It makes all kinds of noise--it is forever thundering, boiling, crashing, and whistling. It is easy to imagine the Atlantic trying to draw breath--perhaps not so noticeably out in mid-ocean, but where it meets land, its waters bathing up and down a sandy beach. It mimics  nearly perfectly the steady breathing of a living creature. It is filled with _ existences, too: unimaginable quantities of creatures, little and large alike, mix within its depths in a kind of oceanic harmony, giving to the waters a feeling of heartbeat, a kind of sub-ocean vitality. And it has a psychology. It has personalities: sometimes peaceful and pleasant, on rare occasions rough and wild; always it is strong and striking.

Option (I): Cut off the top of the laundry container just above the handle for easy access and store on a shelf. Option (II): Cut off the top of the laundry container and store on a garage shelf. Here are the steps I would take to analyze and justify the choice: 1. Observe the similarities: Both options involve cutting off the top of the laundry container and storing it on a shelf. The primary goal of repurposing the container for garage storage is satisfied. 2. Identify the differences: The only difference between the two options is that Option (I) emphasizes cutting the top just above the handle to ensure easy access to the contents. In contrast, Option (II) simply mentions cutting the top without specifying where to cut or the reason for the cut. 3. Evaluate the reasoning: The primary goal is to repurpose the laundry container for garage storage. Option (I) considers not only the reusability of the container but also the convenience and accessibility of the storage. By cutting just above the handle, it takes into account the ease of handling the container when stored on a shelf. In comparison, Option (II) does not provide any specific guidance on where to cut or any consideration towards the ease of accessing the contents. 4. Come to a conclusion: Based on the evaluation, Option (I) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of using laundry bottles for garage storage as it takes into consideration accessibility and convenience, whereas Option (II) does not provide any specific guidance on cutting or handling. Thus, the answer is (I): Cut off the top of the laundry container just above the handle for easy access and store on a shelf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices:  - excited - ownership - satisfaction - being happy - disappointment  The rationale to choose \\"disappointment\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"disappointment\\" as the answer lies in the understanding of the presented situation and the emotional response it evokes in the subject. In this case, the subject (the girl) is aware of the presents she will be receiving, and it is explicitly mentioned that none of these presents align with her desires or wishes. This leaves us with the task of determining the most likely emotional response from the given choices: excited, ownership, satisfaction, being happy, or disappointment. 1. Excited: Generally, excitement is associated with positive surprises and anticipation of desired outcomes. However, in this scenario, the subject already knows that none of the presents she is getting are what she wanted. This knowledge negates the possibility of excitement being the appropriate emotional response. 2. Ownership: Ownership refers to the sense of possession or control over something. While the girl will eventually own the presents she receives, this term does not accurately describe her emotional response to the knowledge that none of the gifts are what she wanted. 3. Satisfaction: Satisfaction is associated with the fulfillment of desires or needs. Since the girl knows that her desires will not be met by the presents she is getting, it is unlikely that she would be feeling satisfaction in this situation. 4. Being happy: Happiness is a positive emotional state, often experienced when one's desires, needs, or expectations are met. As the girl's desires are not being met by the presents she is getting, happiness is not likely to be her emotional response. 5. Disappointment: Disappointment represents the emotional reaction one experiences when their expectations, desires, or needs are not met. In this situation, the girl knows that her expectations and desires will not be met by the presents she is receiving. This knowledge makes disappointment the most suitable emotional response from the provided list. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"disappointment\\" as the answer is that it best represents the emotional response one is likely to experience when their desires or expectations are not met. In this case, the girl's knowledge that none of the presents she's getting are what she wanted makes disappointment the most appropriate response out of the available choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What area of the brain controls functions of the body required for life? Context: The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.","output":"The area of the brain that controls functions of the body required for life is the motor areas in the medulla and pons.

Requin's address The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: The Enigmatic Key Genre: Action/Mystery/Sci-Fi Plot Summary: In the near future, a group of seemingly unrelated individuals find themselves in possession of a mysterious encrypted message. As they decode the cryptic cypher, they discover that Schroeder, a reclusive tech billionaire, has given them the address of a notorious criminal mastermind known as Requin. Fueled by curiosity, the individuals decide to work together to unveil the reason for receiving this perplexing information and their connection to Schroeder and Requin. As they unravel the secrets, they uncover a high-stakes conspiracy that could have dire global consequences. Plot: Act I: The story begins with a series of seemingly coincidence encounters as our lead characters - a former hacker, a college professor, a journalist, and an enigmatic stranger - all receive the same encrypted message from an unknown source. When they finally decipher the text, they realize that Schroeder, a tech billionaire who vanished from the public eye years ago, has given them Requin's address. Intrigued, the characters begin to investigate their connection to Schroeder and Requin. Act II: As the characters delve into their mysterious past, they find out that they all are connected to Project Genesis, a secret experiment led by Schroeder and Requin. Genesis was designed to use artificial intelligence to create a universal problem-solving tool. However, Requin exploited the technology for his own twisted ambitions, attempting to manipulate global markets and destabilize governments. Realizing they have been pawns in a larger game and driven by a sense of responsibility, the individuals decide to join forces to stop Requin and expose Project Genesis. Act III: As they work together, the group follows the encrypted messages provided by Schroeder to Requin's heavily-guarded fortress. Inside, they discover the full scale of the Project Genesis. Requin plans to hold the world hostage by unleashing the AI's power, giving him unprecedented influence and control. The group infiltrates the facility and confronts Requin. In the final showdown, they work together to outsmart the AI and sabotage Requin's plan, saving humanity from domination. Epilogue: With Requin defeated, the truth about Project Genesis comes to light.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: When not in your home country you are?  Here are possible answers to this question: - foreign - in space - tent - work - outside  I believe the correct choice is \\"foreign\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"When not in your home country, you are indeed considered to be 'foreign.' This is the correct choice, and here's a detailed explanation for why the other options don't fit as appropriate responses: 1. 'Foreign': When you are not in your home country, you are essentially a foreigner, visiting or residing in another country. The term 'foreign' refers to something that comes from or belongs to a different country, nation, or culture. In this context, as a traveler or an expatriate in another country, you are in a foreign land, exposed to different customs, languages, and people. This is fundamentally why 'foreign' is the most fitting and accurate response to the question. 2. 'In space': Although an amusing response, 'in space' implies that you are somewhere in the universe, outside the Earth's atmosphere. It's not relevant to the question, as it doesn't pertain to being in a different country. Unless you are an astronaut or are talking about hypothetical situations, being 'in space' is not a valid option for this question. 3. 'Tent': A tent is a temporary shelter composed of fabric or other materials, supported by poles, ropes, and stakes. It has no direct connection to the concept of being in or out of your home country. This option is not valid because it does not relate to the question and lacks context to the situation of being in another nation. 4. 'Work': While one might travel out of their home country for work-related purposes, the term 'work' does not necessarily indicate the situation of being in another country. Work can be performed in various locations, and it's not exclusive to foreign settings. In this case, 'work' fails to address the specificity of being outside one's home country, making it an inappropriate choice. 5. 'Outside': This option could be interpreted in two ways: either being outdoors, which is irrelevant to the context of the question, or being physically outside your home country. However, the term 'outside' is vague and lacks the appropriate context needed to convey the idea of being in another country and interacting with different cultures. Therefore, it is not the best choice in this situation. In conclusion, the most precise and accurate answer to the question, \\"When not in your home country, you are?\\" is 'foreign.' This choice effectively communicates the idea of being in a different country, nation, or culture other than one's own, encompassing the various aspects of traveling or living abroad. The other options—'in space,' 'tent,' 'work,' and 'outside'—don't appropriately address the context of the question and therefore fail to serve as suitable alternatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is shaving against the grain bad? \\"Why are shaved heads 'hot'?\\" Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available options:  A). no  B). yes","output":"Shaving against the grain is considered bad for various reasons, primarily because it can lead to increased skin irritation, potential nicks and cuts, and ingrown hairs.  When you shave against the direction of hair growth or \\"against the grain,\\" you are pulling the hair away from the skin and cutting it at a sharper angle. This can make the hair tips sharp and pointy, which can lead them to more easily penetrate the skin when they grow back, increasing the likelihood of ingrown hairs. Ingrown hairs can cause redness, inflammation, and discomfort.  Additionally, shaving against the grain makes it more likely that you will nick or cut your skin, as the razor has to work harder to cut the hair. Increased pressure on the razor may cause it to slip or catch the skin unexpectedly, potentially causing cuts, irritation, and razor burn.  By contrast, shaving with the grain, or in the direction of hair growth, leads to a more gentle and comfortable shave. It decreases the likelihood of irritation and ingrown hairs and is generally recommended for sensitive skin. Of course, it is essential to remember that everyone's skin is different, so what causes severe discomfort for one individual might not have the same effect on someone else. Regarding the question \\"Why are shaved heads 'hot'?\\", it is seemingly unrelated to the topic of shaving against the grain. This question focuses on personal preferences and societal perceptions of attractiveness. A shaved head might be considered \\"hot\\" or attractive because it can convey an air of confidence, boldness, or a unique sense of style. Shaved heads could also bring more attention to an individual's facial features, and may be seen as low-maintenance and practical. The perception of attractiveness can be subjective and varies greatly from person to person. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question focuses on the consequences of shaving against the grain, while the second question addresses the perceived attractiveness of shaved heads. Thus, the appropriate answer among the available options would be: A). no"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where would you fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - flintlock - tennis court - at home - motion - arcade Answer:","output":"The most suitable option for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth would be an arcade. Let me explain further by elaborating on each of the options provided, including the selected answer. 1. Flintlock: A flintlock is a mechanism used in early firearms. It works by igniting a small amount of gunpowder to release a lead ball projectile. While historically significant, a flintlock is not appropriate for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth for several reasons. It is a weapon designed for a different purpose and could pose serious safety risks. Furthermore, using an actual firearm for a recreational purpose is generally not advisable. 2. Tennis court: A tennis court seems like an unusual location for aiming a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. Tennis courts are specifically designed for playing tennis, and the game involves players using rackets to hit a rubber ball back and forth across a net. In a typical game of tennis, there is no requirement or opportunity to aim at a target like a clown's mouth. Additionally, attempting to do so would disrupt the game and likely be frowned upon by other players and spectators. 3. At home: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth at home is not the most suitable option either. Home environments are generally not equipped to handle projectiles safely. There is a high risk of damaging property or causing injury to others present in the home. Creating a makeshift setup to aim a projectile ball at a clown's mouth at home would be both risky and impractical. 4. Motion: Motion, by its definition, refers to the action of moving or being moved. It does not refer to a specific location or context in which to fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. This option does not provide enough information to gauge its suitability, thus making it an unfit choice. 5. Arcade: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth in an arcade is the most suitable option. Arcades are recreational establishments specifically designed for playing games, including games that involve aiming and shooting projectiles at targets. An arcade might have a designated game that allows players to shoot soft projectile balls at a clown's mouth, ensuring a safe and fun experience. These types of games usually contain proper safety measures, ensuring that the projectiles do not pose a danger to other visitors or the surrounding area. Additionally, this activity would fall within the normal expectations in an arcade environment, providing the appropriate space and context for enjoying this type of game. In conclusion, out of the given options, an arcade is the most suitable place for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. It offers the best combination of safety, entertainment, and contextual appropriateness, making it the prime choice for this activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DeVito played Martini in the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, reprising his role from the 1971 off-Broadway play of the same title. He gained fame in 1978 playing Louie De Palma, the short but domineering dispatcher for the fictional Sunshine Cab Company, on the hit TV show Taxi. After Taxi ended, DeVito began a successful film career, starting with roles in 1983's Terms of Endearment, as the comic rogue in the romantic adventure Romancing the Stone, starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, and its 1985 sequel, The Jewel of the Nile.

The coach of four-time major winner Ernie Els has urged golf's governing bodies to come to a quick decision on the proposed banning of anchored putting. Golf's rulemakers Royal & Ancient (R & A) and the United States Golf Association (USGA), which governs the game in the U.S. and Mexico, announced in November they intend to ban the method of putting by which a club is anchored to a part of the body by 2016. The decision has been backed by the European Tour, but Tim Finchem, commissioner of the lucrative U.S.-based PGA Tour, opposes the rule change which would essentially outlaw the controversial \\"belly putter\\". Els is one of a clutch of recent major winners who favor using the belly putter -- three of the last five majors have been won by a player using the technique. Els' coach Claude Harmon III has called for a solution to be found soon in order to protect the integrity of the game. \\"They have to make a decision quickly,\\" Harmon told CNN's Living Golf. \\"Brandt Snedeker, who's easily the best putter on the planet, got up and said to Tim, 'You've got to make a decision now. \\"If we let this thing continue for three or four more years the guys that are still using the long putter are still going to be winning golf tournaments and then do we put a asterisk, is there a stigma attached to that. \\"The longer this keeps going and they still can't find a decision, a guy like Keegan Bradley, does he practice and waste time away from his game to try and do something or does he just continue to do what he is really good at?\\" Bradley and fellow American Webb Simpson both used the anchored putting technique to win the PGA Championship in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Harmon joined Finchem in questioning whether the method offered players an advantage over more conventional putting techniques. \\"None of the best putters in the world use a belly putter and I know from talking to guys like Ernie, like Keegan Bradley and Webb Simpson, I think they do feel a little bit that there's a target on their back,\\" added Harmon. \\"I think it is going to be very hard to quantify with data an advantage that a belly putter gives players. \\"The PGA Tour and the European Tour and golf at a professional level is a sport absolutely, but it is also a business. \\"For me what Tim Finchem is trying to do is say to the governing bodies, this is just my opinion, that if you're going to make decisions that affect the professional game you have to involve the professional game.\\" Former world No. 1 Martin Kaymer, who uses a traditional putter, also wants to see the issue put to bed. \\"I'm a little tired of it,\\" 2010 PGA championship winner Kaymer told CNN. \\"Everybody should make a decision and we move on. All the speculation now is a little bit too much. \\"The PGA Tour, the R & A, the European Tour, they should sit down and make a decision together.\\" Kevin Garside, of British newspaper The Independent, suggests the reintroduction of golf at the 2016 Olympic Games means anchored putting will be banned, despite U.S. resistance. \\"I think it's clear where this is going,\\" said Garside. \\"You can't get this far and then say, 'OK, as you were.' The putter is going to be banned. \\"The Olympic Games is coming up, you can't have an anchored putter at the Olympic Games. It's as simple as that.\\" According to Bob Harig of ESPN.com, the PGA Tour will have to back down in order to avoid a division within the sport. \\"You can't have different rules,\\" Harig said. \\"They're going to have to fall in line with whatever the USGA and R & A do. \\"It would be chaotic if the PGA Tour wrote their own rule on this, which they've never done. It would be a major departure.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a debate in golf over a method of putting called \\"anchored putting.\\" Some people in golf think that using anchored putting, where a club is held against a body part while swinging, might give players an unfair advantage.

Some well-known golf players and coaches are asking for a quick decision on this issue to help keep the sport fair and to know if they should practice this putting method or not.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially, losers (may be too harsh a word, I will call them suburban under-achievers). This film was a dark comedy gem, and I'm not sure what people expect. I relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor, and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (the J-Man's decrepit \\"cabin by the lake\\", Corky's unceremonious burial, Weitz's wife role, and Walken's J-Man -- all great stuff. I can't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It's wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem. Remember this people; Most times, Popular doesn't equal Good.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the review, I will break it down into key points and evaluate each point's sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. 1. The reviewer compares \\"Envy\\" to other misunderstood comedies like \\"Ishtar\\" and \\"King of Comedy,\\" which implies a positive sentiment. 2. The reviewer praises the performances of the two main actors, which is a positive sentiment. 3. They describe the film as a \\"dark comedy gem,\\" indicating a positive sentiment. 4. The reviewer appreciates the movie for not being filled with obvious humor and highlights some moments they found compelling. This is a positive sentiment. 5. The reviewer considers the movie's simple story as an interesting exploration of envy, which is a positive sentiment. 6. The reviewer mentions many memorable scenes and characters, which shows a positive sentiment. 7. The reviewer criticizes people who trash films without understanding the effort behind making them, which indicates a negative sentiment towards those people but a supportive sentiment towards the film. 8. The reviewer prefers \\"Envy\\" to most top-grossing comedies, which is a positive sentiment. 9. They describe the movie as \\"wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem,\\" which is a positive sentiment. 10. The reviewer concludes by saying that popular doesn't always equal good, implying that the movie has value despite not being popular, which carries a neutral-to-positive sentiment. Overall, the sentiment of this review is predominantly positive.

The 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home, so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist, by transplanting the action to The Black Forest and giving it the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody, but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsin particular, the non-stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. Had Timo Rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him, then Barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore-fest: his inexperienced cast do reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awful camera-work, choppy editing, and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film-makers. I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore, which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.

Plot title: The Bonfire of the Vanities Movie plot: Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a Wall Street investor who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and the two find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two suspicious black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire placed purposely in the middle of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and putting him in a coma. The two drive away and decide not to report the accident to the police. Meanwhile, indigent alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman), almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlady of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment...

Help as much as you can. How can you help kids cope with  stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor  or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home. Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids? A) Their kids are growing so fast. B) They have too much housework. C) Their kids are losing interest in them. D) They are tired out after work. The answer to this question is:","output":"D) They are tired out after work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series.  In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life.  He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits.  Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls.

A motorist who hit and killed a delivery man has walked free from court after claiming he was dazzled by the sun shining in his eyes. Phillip White, 52, was accused of being 'on automatic pilot' when he hit Nigel Gutteridge, 61, as he unloaded wood from his lorry, pinning him against the back doors. White, who lives just yards from the accident in Tiverton, Devon, was driving to work at the time and claimed to be travelling at 25 miles an hour, despite his van being found in fourth gear. Not guilty: White collapsed in the dock after being found not guilty today at Exeter Crown Court. During the trial Mr Richard Crabb, prosecuting, asked him: 'You were on automatic pilot, making a journey you have done many times before?' He said: 'I had seen the sun shining down the road before but never as bright as that morning. I had never known it that bright before. 'I put my visor down but can't remember where I was when I did so. I have asked myself a thousand times why I didn't see the lorry, but I never saw it. 'I got into my van that morning, got out onto the road and I hit the lorry. That is all I can remember. 'I don't know. I'm sorry. I never saw the lorry until I hit it.' The jury also heard evidence from PC Philip Rowan-Smith who said he had recreated the journey the next day and found that he had to slow down due to bright sunshine. The prosecution argued that if White had been blinded then he should also have slowed down, but no tyre marks were found at the scene and witnesses said they had not seen White use his brakes. Prosecutor Richard Crabb said: 'Witnesses don't describe seeing any braking or swerving. He said he had been blinded by the sunlight, which was rising in the east in front of him. 'He had driven the road a thousand times and he must appreciate that the sun might be a problem at that time in the morning. 'He should have seen the lorry and driven around it and if he was dazzled by the sun, he should have slowed down.' Fatal: Mr White hit Mr Gutteridge just off of Lea Road after leaving his house on Barle Court for work. Mr Gutteridge died instantly when he was pinned to the back of his lorry. Mr Gutteridge, from Thelbridge Cross, in Witheridge, was a former director of a tool hire firm and was semi-retired, only working for the deliver company part-time. Gutteridge had just got out of his cab on April 10 2012 to start unloading his lorry when he was hit and died instantly. White collapsed in the dock of Exeter Crown Court today as the not guilty verdict was read out by the jury. Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'This is a tragic event whereby a man lost his life. My sympathies go to Mr Gutteridge's family.' The case is not the only one in which a driver has pleaded not guilty, claiming the sun was in their eyes. In November last year a jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of 22-year-old Lauren Paul, from Hampshire, who killed lollipop man Raymond Elsmore as he was escorting a pregnant woman across the road. Mr Elsmore died of head and chest injuries after being hit by Ms Paul at 3pm on December 5, 2012. Ms Paul claimed she had been blinded by sunlight at the time and that she was also trying to clear condensation from her front window. The prosecution have asked for a retrial at a date yet to be fixed.","output":"This news article is about a man named Phillip White who accidentally hit and killed a delivery man with his car.

Short movie review: a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, the critic appears to have a predominantly negative view of the movie. However, they seem to find a silver lining in its entertainment value due to its unintended comedic aspect. The term \\"cinematic disaster\\" clearly illustrates that the critic believes the movie to be very poorly made, which is a negative evaluation. Additionally, the word \\"inadvertently\\" suggests the humor the critic finds in the movie is unintentional, meaning the filmmakers did not set out to make a comedy or intentionally create humorous scenes. This implies that the movie fails in its intended objectives, further supporting the negative viewpoint of the critic. However, the critic acknowledges that the movie is \\"worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone,\\" suggesting that, despite its many shortcomings, it might still provide a unique form of entertainment for the audience. The use of the term \\"ridicule\\" implies that viewers may find enjoyment in mocking or laughing at the movie's faults, even though this is most likely not the filmmakers' intention. Thus, there is a degree of positivity in the critic's review, as they do acknowledge an entertaining aspect to the film. Overall, the critic's review leans towards a negative standpoint, considering the movie a failure in its primary goals. However, they suggest that the film offers some unintentional humor, making it enjoyable for the audience in an unexpected way. So, while the movie may not be praised for its intended qualities, the critic does find value and entertainment in its accidental comedic elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find. The next day, the woman drops the Polaroid down to Mrs. Hacker from a window overlooking the pavement. Marcato's name and phone number are written... My question: What are her parent's occupations?

Answer:","output":"The glass ball is more likely to break if Daniel drops it. This is because the glass ball has a more rigid and brittle structure compared to the rubber ball, which has a flexible and elastic nature. When the glass ball is dropped, it cannot absorb or disperse the impact energy as effectively as the rubber ball. Consequently, the glass ball is more susceptible to breaking upon impact. On the other hand, the rubber ball's flexible nature enables it to better absorb the shock and bounce back, reducing its likelihood of breaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Title: Underworld Movie plot: Background: 1,400 years ago, Vampires had decided that the best way to ensure the survival of their species was for three Elders--Viktor, Marcus, and Amelia--to 'leap frog' through time, one ruling while the other two slept, each being awakened at their appointed time according to a never-to-be-broken covenant. 1,000 years ago, during the reign of Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Elders, the Vampire-Lycan War began. 600 years ago, Kraven set the 'great blaze' which killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans. Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the chaos, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet bullet that can kill vampires, and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under the subway.Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires at Kraven's luxurious masnion that sits on the outskirts of the city, but they are more interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight's formal party with the coven from across the 'great ocean' in celebration of the upcoming awakening of Marcus by Amelia, the current reigning Elder. Not interested in their gaities, Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human.

Question: I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  I am facing a new situation today: India decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, and Nepal decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the different energy sources Fossil fuels (used by India) release carbon dioxide when they are burned for energy, while hydro power (used by Nepal) is a renewable energy source that does not release carbon dioxide. Step 2: Recall the impact of energy sources on the carbon cycle From the background article, we know that the burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis, having a negative impact on the carbon cycle. In contrast, renewable energy sources like hydro power do not release carbon dioxide and have minimal direct impact on the carbon cycle. Step 3: Evaluate both countries' choices of energy sources India's choice of using fossil fuels for electricity generation will release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, while Nepal's choice of hydro power will not contribute to carbon dioxide emissions. Step 4: Determine which country has more impact on the carbon cycle Based on the evaluation, India's choice of using fossil fuels will have a greater impact on the carbon cycle due to the release of carbon dioxide.

The fighting began at 5 a.m. as the HV force, deployed in 26 squads, captured six out of seven villages on the plateau by the end of the morning. At 8:00 p.m., the HV captured the village of Ključ, and all of the plateau. The advance created a HV-held salient south of Knin, several kilometres deep. It also led the RSK artillery to bombard Šibenik and HV bombardment of Knin in response, both on 22 June. The artillery fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV positions at the Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, in order to discuss the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some artillery fire. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks. How many hours after the fighting began and the HV force deployed 26 squads did they capture the village of Kljuc and all of the plateau?","output":"The fighting began at 5 a.m., and the HV forces captured the village of Ključ and all of the plateau at 8 p.m. on the same day. There are 15 hours between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. So, it took them 15 hours after the fighting began and the HV force deployed 26 squads to capture the village of Ključ and all of the plateau."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A class of injectable drugs used to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis doesn't raise the risk of serious infection when compared with more conventional treatments, according to a new analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The research, which was funded by the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies, contradicts numerous earlier studies that did find an increased risk of infection associated with the drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. The possibility that TNF inhibitors -- which include popular drugs such as Humira and Enbrel -- pose no additional infection risk is a \\"very new and heretical idea,\\" says David T. Felson, M.D., a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Boston University School of Medicine, who cowrote an editorial accompanying the study. \\"Up until now there has been considerable evidence that anti-TNFs heightened the risk of serious infection compared to other treatments.\\" Health.com: Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The lead author of the study, Carlos G. Grijalva, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, says the findings \\"should be reassuring for patients and providers.\\" Felson, however, says the new findings aren't sufficient to quell the concerns raised by previous studies. \\"We still need to be concerned about serious infection risk among patients starting these medicines,\\" he says. Autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, arise when the body's immune system goes awry and begins attacking healthy cells and tissue. TNF inhibitors -- known as biologic drugs, because they're derived from substances that occur naturally in humans and animals -- work by blocking the action of TNF, an important immune-system molecule. Health.com: 10 risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. This class of drugs drastically improved the treatment of these conditions when first introduced in the late 1990s, but because they suppress the immune system they are believed to open the door to opportunistic infections. Some patients taking the drugs have died from these infections, and the FDA has been closely watching the drugs' safety profile as more and more people use them. Previous studies have found that TNF inhibitors as much as double the risk of serious infection compared with other treatment options. Those trials tended to be relatively small, however. The new study, which was presented this weekend at an annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, sought to address that weakness. Grijalva and his colleagues combined data on more than 32,000 mostly low-income people from four large health-care databases, including those for Medicaid and Medicare. About half of the people took TNF-inhibitors for their conditions, and the other half took older, non-biologic drugs -- such as leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine. Health.com: Got psoriasis? 7 signs you may have arthritis too. The authors identified 1,172 infections requiring hospitalization during the study period. (The most common infections were pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infections.) After one year of treatment, people taking TNF inhibitors had no higher risk of serious infections than those taking other types of drugs. The researchers did find, however, that among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the TNF inhibitor Remicade carried an approximately 25% higher risk of infection than Enbrel or Humira. How well are you managing your rheumatoid arthritis? Take a health test. It's not clear why Remicade might be riskier than other TNF inhibitors, but it's possible that the higher initial doses the drug requires might be partly responsible, Grijalva says. The mechanism of action may also be slightly different than that of other TNF inhibitors, he adds. The study does have an important limitation that detracts from the findings, Felson says. As he notes in his editorial, some 40% of participants taking TNF inhibitors dropped out within the first month, compared with only 15% in the comparison group. In previous trials and in clinical practice, people who stop taking TNF blockers \\"tend to be older and at a higher risk of serious infections,\\" Felson says. That pattern, he adds, may have skewed the study results and made TNF inhibitors look safer than they perhaps really are. Copyright Health Magazine 2011.

Process:  - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose lots of rainy weather happens, how will it affect more animals die from smoke inhalation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"If there is a lot of rainy weather during or immediately after a forest fire, it can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, potentially impacting the number of animals dying from smoke inhalation. Direct effects: 1. Rain can help extinguish the fire more quickly, which reduces the amount of smoke produced. This decreases the chances of animals dying from smoke inhalation. 2. The rain can also help to disperse smoke particles in the air, lowering the overall concentration of smoke. This makes it easier for animals to breathe and reduces their exposure to harmful smoke. Indirect effects: 1. The rain can create a more conducive environment for the growth of fire-resistant vegetation. In the event of a forest fire, these plants can slow the spread of the fire, providing animals with more time to escape. 2. The rainy weather can also encourage the growth of new plants, which can provide a source of food to animals after the fire. This can aid in the recovery of the ecosystem and help to support the remaining animals. 3. The rain may create additional water sources, such as puddles or ponds, providing temporary habitats for aquatic animals. These water sources can also help disperse and dilute smoke, making the environment less toxic. Overall, the supposed perturbation of rainy weather would likely have a positive effect in reducing the number of animals dying from smoke inhalation. By extinguishing the fire more quickly and dispersing smoke particles, rain can reduce exposure to harmful smoke, provide new habitats, and support the recovery of the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit.  Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach.  They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden.  There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching  for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie. As each of the gangsters see Gerald, an identical lookalike to the deceased Syd, they have nervous breakdowns; one imagining himself a dog, one turning into a Larry Fine lookalike, the other (Charlie Callas, in his usual character) becoming a hopeless stutterer.

Here, the speaker is aligning themselves with the Vice President's perspective and is explicitly making a call to action for Chairman Arafat to 'pull back his people'. Now, let's go deeper into the mention of 'this difficult period'. This phrase seems to refer to a challenging time that is not clearly defined within the given context. However, the speaker's comment about the administration working hard to calm tensions suggests ongoing strife or conflict that needs addressing. It seems to indicate a stressful social or political context which is creating tension and unrest among the people. Based on this context, the statement of requiring Chairman Arafat's intervention aligns with the hypothesis. The call for Chairman Arafat to pull back his people is suggested to be a critical step in diffusing the heightened tensions and stress during this challenging period. This command is likely indicating a hope that such a move would de-escalate the apparent conflict situation and could possibly form a pathway to peace. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that 'Chairman Arafat needs to pull back his people during a difficult time' is aligned and supported by the given context.

Read this article and answer this question The parishes of Repola and Porajärvi of the Olonets Governorate had voted in favor of secession from Bolshevist Russia and had been occupied by Finland later that year. In late 1919 the Russian White Army retreated towards the Finnish border to the Repola-Porajärvi area. The Finnish government led by Juho Vennola decided in February 1920 that Finland should intervene to help the dissidents by diplomatic means. Foreign minister Rudolf Holsti sent a message to his counterpart Georgy Chicherin stating that Finland would disarm the retreating Russian White troops if the Red Army does not occupy the parishes. Agreement was honoured by both parties, although there were minor skirmishes between Finnish troops and the Red Army. These fights led to armistice negotiations in Rajajoki, which ended unsuccessfully after two weeks. There had been uprisings in White Karelia as early as 1920. After British forces left Karelia, Karelian ethnic nationalists arranged a meeting in Ukhta  in March-April 1920 where they elected 117 representatives. In the meeting they decided that White Karelia should become an independent nation. Some parishes of Olonets Karelia joined in and the Väliaikainen toimikunta  renamed itself to Karjalan väliaikainen hallitus . However, the Red Army suppressed this uprising and in summer 1920 the Temporary Government fled to Finland. In its place, the Karelian Worker's Commune was formed, an autonomous oblast of the RSFSR. During the treaty negotiations, Finland proposed a referendum in East Karelia, through which its residents could choose whether they wanted to join Finland or Soviet Russia. Due to opposition from Russia, Finland had to withdraw the initiative. In return of ceding Repola and Porajärvi back to Russia, Finland acquired Petsamo and a promise of cultural autonomy for East Karelia. However this cultural autonomy was poorly carried out.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\".

They take the bear back to their research station where David calls his daughter Evelyn and pleads her to come up. Their relationship has become strained as the recent death of her mother was complicated with the fact that David could not make it to the funeral. She tentatively agrees to come up when he offers to give her all the money left to her by her mother. After getting off the line with her, David and Jane are told that the bear has died and they go to investigate. Meanwhile a group of students, Ling, Freddie and Adam are selected to attend Kruipen's research.Days later, the research team is feeling the effects of a strange illness, and Kruipen instructs helicopter pilot Bart to not bring his daughter to the station. However Evelyn's insistence forces him to go against David's orders and take her along with the students to the station. They arrive, but no one is there. Evelyn calls out and reaches Jane who learns that despite warning them away as David had said, he did not tell them not to come. In reaction, Jane shoots and apparently kills Kruipen and another researcher and makes her escape. Meanwhile the students discover the bear dead in the research station, and Bart is bitten while touching it. Adam blames it on fleas. Freddie and Ling make up, and Freddie spots a strange bug disappearing where they are sleeping, he admits to having a phobia of them, and goes to sleep in another room.

Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange was born in Townsville, Queensland, to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951), a visual artist, and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder. The couple had separated before Assange was born.  When he was a year old, his mother married Richard Brett Assange, an actor, with whom she ran a small theatre company. They divorced around 1979. Christine Assange then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982. Assange had a nomadic childhood, and had lived in over thirty Australian towns by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne, Victoria.  He attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979-1983) and Townsville State High School, as well as being schooled at home. He studied programming, mathematics, and physics at Central Queensland University (1994) and the University of Melbourne (2003-2006), but did not complete a degree.  While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they had a son, Daniel Assange, now a software designer. The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child. Assange was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood. In an open letter to French President Francois Hollande, Assange stated his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said that his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he go to college?","output":"Yes, Julian Assange went to college.

The student cannot get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more cares about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in the essay form. Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. Because of _ , the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be gotten. Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements about the objective test is NOT true? - It is more objective than the essay test in terms of scoring. - It allows the student to guess the correct answer without really knowing the material. - It shows the student's ability to think about difficult problems. - It is easy and quick to score. A:","output":"The statement about the objective test that is NOT true according to the passage is: \\"It shows the student's ability to think about difficult problems.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In the winter of 1240/1241, the Novgorodians took Pereyaslavl-Zalessky. After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign.. On April 5, 1242, one of Russia's most famous battles, the Battle of the Ice, took place on the ice of Lake Peipsi. The battle was a significant defeat sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades. The crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Russian territories for the next century.

It’s not clear whether all those required emissions tests actually make the air cleaner Doug Decker's friends in high school knew how to cheat state emissions tests in their modified Mustangs and Firebirds: Just before the inspection, they'd adjust the carburetor to fill the engine with more air and less gasoline. The car would generate less power, but the fuel would burn completely, and the exhaust would come out clean. \\"It was the way you played the game,\\" said Decker, who is now in charge of motor-vehicle pollution for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. \\"It's still the same game,\\" he added. This week, Volkswagen admitted that it manipulated some 482,000 diesel engines to bamboozle inspectors. Some automotive experts see vulnerability in government emissions-testing programs, despite their cost and inconvenience for drivers. Regulators say that Volkswagen's so-called \\"defeater device\\" used sensors for pressure, temperature, engine speed and more to register when the car was being put through the minutely prescribed federal testing procedure. If the onboard computer detected a test underway, it would reduce the car's emissions. On the road, the car would run normally, likely with improved gas mileage and performance but emitting nitrogen oxide at as much as 40 times the federal limit, according to regulators. \\"Our company was dishonest with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board and with all of you,\\" VW's U.S. chief, Michael Horn, said Monday. Testing allows the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce its fuel economy standards, but since the protocols are published in advance in detail, manufacturers are able to design cars that perform better on the tests than on the road, Bishop argued. Outright manipulation isn't always necessary. Tests mandated by state and local governments didn't detect anything amiss, because few states test diesel engines in light-duty vehicles. What's more, diesel inspections generally don't test for nitrogen monoxide, the primary oxide of nitrogen produced by diesel engines, which is colorless and odorless. For drivers with gasoline engines, these simpler tests are far easier to cheat than the federal inspection, a comprehensive shakedown that can take a few hours. Gearheads might once have tinkered with an engine's timing using a screwdriver, but these days, they can buy aftermarket computer chips for better acceleration or towing capacity. These chips sometimes mean more pollutants, too. An extreme example is the practice of \\"rolling coal\\" -- disabling the pollution-control program in a diesel truck's computer so that the vehicle spouts a plume of thick black exhaust -- which has no other purpose other than mocking environmentalists on the road. Drivers can unplug these modifications before taking the car in for mandated testing. Inspection \\"costs lots of money,\\" said Gary Bishop, a research engineer at the University of Denver. \\"It does absolutely nothing to clean up the air.\\" Bishop's laboratory has developed a roadside sensor, which he and his colleagues have been using for more than a decade to see how cars actually do on the street in several major cities. The results allow Bishop to guess as to what modifications drivers have made to their cars. A Honda Civic with an unusual profile in the emissions data probably has a street-racing chip, for example. And some vehicles are obviously malfunctioning and should be taken off the road. \\"They're putting out so much unburned gasoline that you could actually run another car off of their tailpipe,\\" Bishop said. One of the cities where Bishop has worked is Tulsa, Okla., where emissions tests have never been required. The group has found that emissions from the cars in Tulsa are no worse than emissions in other cities where standards are enforced. Authorities are now using the sensors in and around Denver and in a few other states as a supplement to conventional testing. The state sets up the sensors at highway on-ramps and elsewhere along the road. Drivers don't stop. They just roll between two rows of cones while a camera records the car's license plate and the equipment registers the emissions from the tailpipe, and go on their way. If a car produces at least two passing grades, the driver is spared the trip to the inspection station. The sensors clear about a third of the vehicles that would be due for inspection in any given month, said Decker of the Department of Public Health and Environment. \\"That's a tremendous convenience,\\" he said. \\"Remote sensing has been a wonderful thing for the people of Colorado.\\" If a car's fumes are suspicious, though, there is little the state can do beyond ask the driver to bring it in for inspection. Remote sensing can't solve all the problems of testing for emissions. All the same, the technology is attracting policymakers' attention. Nevada will be putting the sensors along its roads in the coming years. State Assemblyman Jim Wheeler called remote sensing \\"the only true test right now.\\" Before he became the Republican whip, Wheeler was the head of a company that manufactured aftermarket car parts. He predicted that manipulation on emissions tests will continue. \\"As technology continues to advance, we're going to see more and more of this, especially in the aftermarket-parts arena,\\" Wheeler said. \\"By, I think, the end of the decade, you're going to see a lot of states going to drive-by testing.\\" Max Ehrenfreund writes for Wonkblog and compiles Wonkbook, a daily policy newsletter.

Article: Oxford University has introduced confidence classes for female students to get them to compete for jobs in future and win chances to work in best companies. They may be young and gifted but research at the excellent institution has found that female undergraduates are shying away from applying to jobs in banking, finance, management consultancy , engineering and resource management. Partly as a result, starting salaries for women when they graduate are on average PS2,000 to PS3,000 lower than their male counterparts.  \\"Women are earning less on leaving Oxford. It is ridiculous,\\" said JonathanBlack, the careers service director at the university. \\"We have high quality, high achieving students of both genders. But it appears that women are selecting lower paid jobs. They accept more prejudice in certain industries and are saying I won't struggle for that really high paid job'. We are not trying to push loads of women but we are trying to say, you should feel able to apply for these sorts of jobs. Boys seem to have a more self-confidence and see the bigger picture generally, even when their self-belief is not necessarily based on any greater academic advantage.\\" The four-day programme at Oxford will help 45 female undergraduates improve their self-confidence and decision making, think positively and build on their strengths. Confidence training will teach them how to deal with opposition and challenging situations.  Successful female employees from RBS and BP, which are supporting the course, will talk about their lives and careers.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A dwarf planet is shining two bright lights at a NASA spacecraft right now, and our smartest scientists are unsure what they are.      As bizarre as that sentence sounds, that's the situation with Ceres — the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, officially designated as a dwarf planet (the same category as Pluto).      NASA's Dawn spacecraft is approaching Ceres ahead of a March 6 rendezvous. The picture above was taken February 19, from a distance of just under 29,000 miles, and shows two very shiny areas on the same basin on Ceres' surface.      Previous Dawn images from further away showed a single light on Ceres, which was just as mysterious. Then, to the amazement of every astronomy geek, the one light turned out to be two — reflecting roughly 40% of the light hitting them.      The lights on Ceres in earlier photos from the Dawn spacecraft. Image: NASA/Associated Press      \\"This is truly unexpected and still a mystery to us,\\" said Andreas Nathues, lead investigator for the framing camera team at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany, in a NASA statement. \\"The brightest spot [of the two] continues to be too small to resolve with our camera, but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on Ceres.\\"      So what could the bright spots be, other than alien castaways signaling at us with flashlights?      The most obvious contender is ice, although ice would reflect more than 40% of all light hitting it. The difference may be accounted for by the resolution limit of Dawn's camera at this distance. Scientists have previously detected water vapor coming from the surface of the dwarf planet, making ice a more likely option.      Scientists have also suggested the bright areas could be patches of salt. On the other hand, the location of the two bright spots so close together may be an indication that they have a geologic origin, such as some sort of volcanic process, possibly even ice volcanoes.      According to Chris Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, the positioning of the bright spots within the same area may indicate \\"a volcano-like origin of the spots,\\" but scientists will have to wait for higher resolution images before making such interpretations. Scientists don't think the spots comprise lava similar to that seen on Earth, since that would shine more brightly.      We'll find out more as Dawn approaches Ceres next week and more imagery comes in during the next 16 months, according to NASA. In the meantime, here's more on Dawn and its eight-year mission: ||||| NASA's Dawn spacecraft is getting sharper views of the mysterious bright spot on the dwarf planet Ceres as the probe prepares to go into orbit — and it turns out that the spot is actually two spots, lying next to each other in the same big crater basin.      Could the spots be patches of ice, welling up from the interior of the biggest asteroid and the smallest known dwarf planet? Stay tuned.      \\"Right now, all we can say is that the material reflects 40 percent or more of the light falling on it,\\" UCLA astronomer Chris Russell, the principal investigator for the Dawn mission, told NBC News in an email. \\"This limit is because of the resolution of the camera at this distance from Ceres. If the final answer ... is that it reflects all the light that falls on it, then the most probable reflector would be ice.\\"      In a news release accompanying the pictures released on Wednesday, Russell said the spots may have a \\"volcano-like origin,\\" but added that such an interpretation would depend on the sharper images to come. Last year, scientists reported detecting water vapor escaping from Ceres — leading them to speculate that water might be welling up from beneath the surface.      These images of the dwarf planet Ceres, processed to enhance clarity, were taken on Feb. 19 from a distance of about 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers), by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers. NASA / JPL-Caltech / UCLA / MPS / DLR / IDA      These newly released pictures were taken on Feb. 19, when the refrigerator-sized spacecraft was nearly 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers) away from Ceres. The Dawn probe — which was launched in 2007 and spent the first part of its mission studying the asteroid Vesta — is due to go into orbit around Ceres on March 6. Over the course of the following year, Dawn will map the 590-mile-wide (950-kilometer-wide) mini-world from an altitude eventually swinging as low as 232 miles (373 kilometers).      Andrea Nathues, lead investigator for Dawn's framing camera team at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, said the white spots are still too small to resolve with the team's camera, but it's already known that they're brighter than anything else on Ceres.      \\"This is truly unexpected and still a mystery to us,\\" Nathues said.      In his email, Russell noted that the brightest bodies in the outer solar system are those with icy surfaces.      \\"These would not last on Ceres, and so Ceres has a dark surface,\\" Russell said, \\"but if there were ice below the surface it might be occasionally exposed a little bit.\\"      Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed Asteroid Vesta gives clues about solar system autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      What if the spots aren't made of ice? \\"There could be salt on the surface, which would be more reflective than the general claylike material we think covers much of the surface,\\" Russell said. \\"So there is a range of possibilities.\\"      Even though the origin of the spots could be volcano-like, scientists have ruled out the possibility that the spots are made up of lava like that seen on Earth or on Io, one of Jupiter's moons.      \\"That would make a hot spot,\\" Russell said. \\"We think we would have noticed a hot spot by now.\\"      NASA will present a news briefing at noon ET March 2 focusing on the arrival of the Dawn spacecraft at Ceres.

Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator Timbaland, before working on Romeo Must Die. In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, \\"there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it.\\" Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he had to \\"bribe the producers\\", who did not want to \\"go halfway around the world!\\" He added that they ultimately had \\"a beautiful time ... making hot music\\".Most of the album's songs were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, including \\"Loose Rap\\", which was done at both studios.

Both sentences share the common idiom \\"in the first place\\". Linguistically, this phrase is used to refer to the starting point or the origin of a situation or a matter. However, the context and meanings of the two sentences are markedly different. The sentence \\"We never got out of it in the first place!\\" is indicative of a situation where the speaker is asserting that they never exited or escaped from a particular situation. The inference here is that the speaker and perhaps other individuals have remained in a circumstance from the beginning up to the current time. This is different from the sentence \\"Where does the money come from in the first place?\\" which is essentially a question asking for the original source of the money under discussion. The person uttering this question could be demanding clarification about the starting point of a financial transaction or the origin of certain funds. On a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 means 'not similar at all' and 5 means 'means the same thing', I would rate these two sentences as 1. This is because while they do share a common phrase and structure, the actual implications, contexts, and themes of these two sentences are significantly different from each other. So, their similarity lies mostly in the use of the idiomatic phrase \\"in the first place\\" and the construction of the sentences, but not in their meanings, semantics, or contexts.

While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (\\"Romanes eunt domus\\", poorly translated Latin for \\"Romans Go Home\\") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (\\"Romani ite domum\\") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience.

Write a summary based on this article: Donald Trump turned, in the third and final presidential debate, from insulting the intelligence of the American voter to insulting American democracy itself. He falsely insisted there were “millions of people” registered to participate in the election who did not have the right to vote and declared he would not commit to honoring the outcome.      Hillary Clinton was clearly shocked that he was attacking the very foundation of the republic, the American tradition of peacefully transferring power. “That’s horrifying,” she said, rightly. At one point, Mr. Trump even said, outrageously, “She shouldn’t be allowed to run.”      The presidential debate was another exercise in narcissism, bombast and mendacity by Mr. Trump. One could only hope that this might be the last grand display of his gross unfitness to be president.      Mr. Trump arrived at the debate in Las Vegas after days of making venomous attacks on the democratic process, and by implication, the voters’ ability to make sound choices. Asked about whether he would accept the election result, he tersely answered, “I will look at it at the time.” In rejecting his answer, Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Trump is a chronic complainer when he loses, even in an Emmy award competition. But applying his loser’s lament to an American presidential election is a far different proposition than whining about a TV show. “He is talking down our democracy,” Mrs. Clinton warned. ||||| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images      The clear topline story coming out of Wednesday night's presidential debate in Las Vegas was Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the upcoming election. Here's the lead to the AP's debate recap:      Threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy, Donald Trump refused to say Wednesday night that he will accept the results of next month's election if he loses to Hillary Clinton.

RNC Chair Reince Priebus says Trump WILL accept the results of the election — Chris Jansing (@ChrisJansing) October 20, 2016      It's absolutely true that Donald Trump refusing to accept a clear electoral defeat would be petty, selfish, and almost unprecedented. But here's the question: Why would it matter? Who will care, a month from now, what someone who lost the election by, let's say, 7 points and 150 electoral votes says about \\"accepting\\" the results?      The clear majority of Americans won't care because they will have, by definition, just declared that they are not Donald Trump supporters.      Advertisement            The courts won't care because, if the margins shake out like they're currently projected to, there will be no plausible case that the result of the election should be overturned judicially.      Other Republican politicians won't care because Donald Trump will have just lost an election decisively on their party's behalf. Politicians are not known for their loyalty to decisively unpopular lost causes, and there will be plenty of other things for them to hassle Hillary Clinton about that don't involve associating themselves with Mr. Loserman.      Even many Republican voters won't care: Trump is already significantly less popular among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (63 percent favorability) than Clinton is among Democrats and Dem-leaning independents (79 percent). That's not a number that's going to go up if he goes down. ||||| At Wednesday night’s debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump showed us that he does know how to prepare for a debate.      He just should’ve done it sooner.      The evening was by far and away his best performance. Trump hit on all the major themes that his campaign is built upon: economic growth, strong national security, fighting illegal immigration, changing the direction of the country by fighting special interests, corruption and bureaucracy as well as ensuring a Conservative Supreme Court. He had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton’s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama’s failed policies at home and abroad.      He no doubt took a page out of his running mate Mike Pence’s playbook -- who performed so well in the vice presidential debate just a few weeks ago.      Trump had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton’s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama’s failed policies at home and abroad.      He didn’t go off on too many tangents and while Clinton dished out plenty of red meat to get him to explode, he stayed out of the fray more or less.      Trump was certainly more frustrated in the second half of the debate than in the first when he was relatively calm, but this wasn’t close to the explosive Trump we saw in the first debate.      It’s just unfortunate that he chose to challenge the veracity of the democratic process in America because that may well be the only thing people remember about this debate.      Indeed, when Trump said that he won’t necessarily accept the results of the election he made history as the first major party candidate to say something like this before an election. And history will always look back on this with horror.      Not only are Trump’s claims about election rigging unfounded – studies have shown that 31 instances of voter fraud out of a billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014 – but they’re incredibly dangerous and preview serious unrest after the election.      Comments like this also show why Donald Trump didn’t do anything to turn around the race this evening. He has been bleeding support from white college educated women who are certainly not going to be heading back into his camp after he called Clinton a “nasty woman” and told a series of lies about his treatment and statements about women.      I also don't see much in his performance that will appeal to independent swing voters who have been moved over to Clinton’s camp because of questions on his judgment and temperament. Saying that he won’t necessarily accept the results of the election does him no good in that arena.      And for her part, Clinton was exactly what she needed to be. She was reliable, steady and knowledgeable. She gave strong answers on making the economy work for average Americans and hit him hard on his taxes, foundation and economic plan which would cost America over three million jobs and add trillions to the debt.      She was weak on her response to moderator Chris Wallace’s question on her Goldman Sachs speech wherein she said that she wanted a common market by pivoting to Russian hacking. But then again, at this point, it’s only Trump’s base that really cares about these issues.      The untrustworthy numbers are baked in and Clinton is still leading by six to eight points. And that is unlikely to change.      It follows that we may very well have seen the end of the election on Wednesday night.      Trump needed to expand past his base and he most certainly did not do that. All he did was force Republicans to come out in defense of the democratic system in the coming days.

It ratcheted up Trump’s allegations the election was being rigged against him, and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls.      Clinton called the comment “horrifying.”      President Barack Obama blasted Trump on Thursday at a rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Clinton and U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Trump supporter.      “That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people’s minds about the legitimacy of the elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you’re doing the work of our adversaries for them,” Obama said.      Trump modified his comment at a rally in Ohio on Thursday, but did not back off.      “I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win,” he said.      He added he would accept “a clear election result,” but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.      With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives.      Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, said accepting the election result was “the American way.”      Related Coverage Factbox: Women who have alleged inappropriate conduct by Trump      “I didn’t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,” McCain, who has opened a poll lead in his Senate re-election race, said in a statement.      “A concession isn’t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader’s first responsibility.”      McCain has withdrawn his support for Trump.      Asked on Wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power, Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, replied: “What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense. OK?”      TRANSITION OF POWER      Trump’s statement, the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor, made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy.      Clinton accused Trump of being Russian President Vladimir Putin’s puppet. Trump called Clinton a “nasty woman” and a criminal who should be barred from running. They did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended.      On Thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in New York and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other.      “Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, ‘pardon me,’” Trump joked. “And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office.” Trump has said Clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state.      Clinton spoke after Trump at the dinner, which she joked was remarkable in itself. “I didn’t think he’d be ok with a peaceful transition of power,” she said.      U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump smiles after making what he said was a major announcement, that he'd abide by the election results if he won, to supporters at a campaign rally in Delaware, Ohio, U.S. October 20, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst      That show of humor was not the norm, however.      Democrats jumped to ask Republican candidates whether they agreed with Trump, who is making his first run for public office against Clinton, a former senator and first lady.      “Do you agree with Donald Trump to question the results of the election?” the Nevada Democratic Party asked in a release targeting Republican Joe Heck. Heck is in a tight race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto for retiring Democratic leader Harry Reid’s Senate seat.      Trump’s comments did not worry his supporters.      Marion Fields, 48, a registered Democrat who backs Trump, said he did not think concession would be an issue because Trump would win. Were he to lose, “After it’s announced, you’d have to be a professional and concede.”      A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 percent of Americans thought Clinton won the debate, to 39 percent for Trump.      Trump donor and energy investor Dan Eberhart said Trump won. He disagreed with his rhetoric, but still backs the candidate.      “I think Hillary’s policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years. And that backs me into supporting Trump,” Eberhart said.      Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sought on Thursday to defend Trump, saying in television interviews he was “putting people on notice” about voting irregularities.      Trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote-rigging claims, and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound.      Trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which Trump boasted of such behavior.      Slideshow (20 Images)      A 10th woman came forward on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan with attorney Gloria Allred, a Clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault.      Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto called the news conference a “coordinated, publicity-seeking attack” by Allred.      First lady Michelle Obama, a powerful campaigner for Clinton, renewed her criticism of Trump without naming him during a campaign event in Arizona.      “Decent men do not demean women. And we shouldn’t tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the president,” she said. ||||| Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said, \\"I'll keep you in suspense,\\" when answering a question about the tradition of accepting the results of presidential elections. (The Washington Post)      The only way democracy works is if you trust that democracy works. Voters need to feel as though their votes count and that the result is the actual will of the people. Otherwise, why participate? Majority rule works because people have faith that they can rally others to their cause. If people believe instead that elections are a sham and that the outcome is predetermined or at odds with what the majority actually wants, democracy collapses. That faith in rational disagreement evaporates. It doesn't matter if the elections are valid or not, either: If people think they're not, the end.      During the third presidential debate, Donald Trump made an absolutely extraordinary claim, in every sense of the word. Asked by moderator Chris Wallace whether he would accept the results of the election, Trump's response was not, as it was in the first debate, that he would accept Hillary Clinton as the victor, should that be what the votes indicated. His response this time, while trailing by a significant margin?      “We'll see.” We'll see if I accept the results, the Republican nominee for the presidency said during a debate. We'll see.      Trump's been on this kick for a week or two now, a period that overlaps with his collapsing poll numbers and collapsing prospects of actually winning the race. He's been whipping up completely unfounded rumors of widespread efforts to “rig” the national election for no other apparent reason than a personal inability to accept the fact that he isn't likely to win. As Clinton subsequently pointed out, it's the same strategy he put into effect when he was denied an Emmy for “The Apprentice,” tweeting repeatedly that the show was the victim of a rigged system.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says the election is \\"rigged\\" against him, but most of his arguments don't hold up to scrutiny. The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains why. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)      There's no evidence that it was, but rigging the Emmy voting isn't something that would be terribly prohibitive. As we have noted repeatedly — and as we will continue to note precisely because of the harm the idea can do — there is absolutely no evidence that there is a widespread effort to rig the presidential election through the casting of fraudulent ballots. In fact, such an idea would be nearly impossible given the required scale and existing safeguards keeping it from happening.      We've been over this again and again. To throw a presidential election, you need to know which states are close enough to tip and throw the election. You need to know where in the state to apply the right pressure. If your goal is to commit in-person fraud, you need to line up voter registrations in those places for impostors to use. You need to line up hundreds or thousands of volunteers, sworn to secrecy, to go cast those ballots. You need to do this while avoiding detection and avoiding the checks and balances that take place at precincts and at the county and state level. If your goal is to rig the vote-counting, you need to line up corrupt elected officials at various levels of government who can rework the numbers — but then also avoid the practical, statistical evaluations that are used to backstop the counting.      We've cited experts — Republican experts, in fact — involved in the process at various points who point out how ludicrous this all is. Sure, there are dead people on the voter rolls; letting the state know that a voter has passed away isn't high on the to-do lists of grieving families. On rare occasions, a vote is cast on behalf of someone who shouldn't be allowed to vote. But presidential elections involve tens of millions of ballots and voting in thousands of counties across all 50 states. Even if you uncovered 1,000 examples of intentional fraud nationally — which no one has — that's eight-ten-thousandths of a percent of the total vote four years ago. And no state in 2012 came down to a 1,000-vote margin. It defies logic.      We insist on walking through this again because it is important. It's not just that people need to have confidence in the process, it's that there's no reason for them not to. Republicans have fostered the idea of voter fraud for some time now in part to push voter ID laws that have the happy side effect of making it harder for groups that tend to vote Democratic to cast ballots. Normally, the harm seemed limited, and conservative media was happy to hype the problem for the same end.      Now, Trump is running a campaign powered by conservative media in a moment where America is deeply fractured. Nearly half of Clinton supporters don't know anyone backing Trump; nearly three-quarters of Trump backers know no or only a few Clinton backers. If no one you know supports Hillary Clinton and if you read websites that insist on blowing small, unproven claims of fraud into a national epidemic and if your candidate is saying that the voting is rigged, what are you going to believe? Surely not someone from the mainstream media — a group that this same candidate and these same conservative media outlets are telling you are lying to bolster Clinton's candidacy.      He should have said he would accept the results of the election. There is no other option unless we're in a recount again. — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 20, 2016      Polling is a science, conducted by statisticians who use proven mathematical techniques to estimate who's likely to vote and what that vote will look like. In other words, they sample opinions from a broader range of communities than you and your friends represent. Those polls show that Clinton leads, that when voters go to the polls, they intend to cast more votes for Clinton than Trump. That in a democratic contest, a plurality of those who vote are likely to choose Clinton as their preferred candidate.      There's literally no valid reason to assume that this is not a reflection of reality, any more than it was in late September when Trump and Clinton were closer in the polls and Trump insisted that he'd accept the will of the people. Nothing's changed since then, except that Trump had two weak debate performances and a slew of sexual assault allegations, and his poll numbers collapsed.      The irony is that Trump doesn't need to win. Other politicians, this is all they've got. If they lose elections, they have to go get real jobs. Trump has a real job. But he also has pride. And in service to that pride, that same pride that caused him to get rankled about not winning an Emmy, he's willing to cast a shadow over the process that undergirds the most prosperous, stable nation in world history. ||||| If there was any suspense left about which way this election was heading—and I don't think there was much—the last of it disappeared about two-thirds of the way through this year’s final Presidential debate, in Las Vegas on Wednesday, when the moderator, Chris Wallace, of Fox News, asked Donald Trump whether he would accept the result of the election.      Until that point, Trump had been having, by his standards, a decent night. To be sure, he'd said some nutty and offensive things. At one point, he suggested that women in America are having abortions a day or two before babies are due to be born. Later, he uttered a line that belongs in the Hall of Fame for barefaced whoppers: \\"Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.\\" But, otherwise, Trump had largely kept his cool, played to his conservative base on issues like guns and immigration, and got in some jabs at his opponent on her e-mail server and her flip-flopping on trade.      Then came an inevitable question. Wallace, who handled his duties well throughout the night, pressing both candidates on a wide range of topics without appearing to be grandstanding, asked Trump about his incendiary recent claims that the election in November would be “rigged.” This is how Wallace posed the issue:      Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you. Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you—his words—“will absolutely accept the result of this election.” Today, your daughter Ivanka said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?      And this was Trump’s response: \\"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.\\" Trump went on to lament that a \\"corrupt media\\" had \\"poisoned the mind of voters.\\" He claimed that there were \\"millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.\\" And he said that Clinton \\"should never have been allowed to run for the Presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.\\"      After Trump had finished with his little rant, Wallace reminded him that \\"one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power, and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.\\" Wallace asked, “Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?\\"      Trump replied, \\"What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, O.K.?\\"      Much should be, and will be, written about these answers from Trump, and what they might augur for November 8th and its aftermath, for the long-term prospects of the Republican Party, and, indeed, for American democracy. For now, though, let's focus on some more immediate points.      First, Trump's answers amounted to a royal \\"screw you\\" to Mike Pence, to his own daughter Ivanka, and to other members of his campaign, including its manager, Kellyanne Conway, who in recent days had all been trying to explain and frame Trump’s “rigging” rhetoric. Just hours before the debate, in fact, Conway had assured reporters that Trump would accept the result of the election.      Second, Trump could easily have sidestepped Wallace's question, and kept his options open, by saying something like, “I have faith in American democracy, and I fully intend to accept the result, unless the vote is a close one and there is overwhelming evidence of voter fraud.” That, in fact, was pretty much the line Conway went with in the spin room immediately after the debate. One may assume it was the line that she, Pence, and others had expected the candidate to deliver onstage. For whatever reason, he didn't.      Third, the news business operates on story lines. Trump's statements insured what the story line would be coming out of the debate. Minutes after he and Clinton left the stage, there it was splashed across the bottom of the screen on CNN: \\"TRUMP WON'T COMMIT TO ACCEPTING ELECTION RESULTS.\\" Even some of Trump’s staunchest supporters in the media were quick to criticize his comments. “He should have said he would accept the results of the election,” Laura Ingraham wrote on Twitter . \\"There is no other option unless we’re in a recount again.” Trump’s regular critics were much harsher. Bret Stephens, a columnist at the Wall Street Journal , called Trump’s answers “the most disgraceful statement by a presidential candidate in 160 years.”      Finally, Trump's decision to try to delegitimize the election result three weeks before voting day, before an audience of tens of millions of Americans, may have, as many are saying, broken longstanding political norms—but it was also tantamount to a concession of defeat in itself. Yes, he'd already said this stuff at recent rallies (and on Twitter), but a Presidential debate, especially the final one of a cycle, is something else. It’s the last chance the candidates get to speak directly to the country at large.      If Trump believed that he still had a realistic hope of winning, this was his opportunity to act Presidential, to attempt to convince undecided voters, if there are any left, that he has the chops to enter the Oval Office and take charge of the nuclear codes. (Clinton, as usual, reminded people about those.) Early on in the debate, when Trump was restraining himself, this appeared to be his strategy. But, by reverting to conspiracy theories and openly threatening to call the result of the election into question, he made plain that, at this stage, his primary goal is to find someone other than himself to blame for what he, along with virtually everyone else in the political world, evidently sees as an impending defeat. Trump entered the race as a can-do businessman intent on restoring the country to greatness. He’s going out as a sore loser, raving at the world, threatening to unleash chaos.

While both candidates gave strong answers during the debate, ultimately, Trump's challenge on the democratic process was what stood out.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.

Initially, both Erin and Emily discovered they each had a cyst during their routine medical check-ups. They exhibited different symptoms that led their doctors to conduct further investigations and eventually discover the presence of the cysts.  Erin, however, had a more complex situation due to the size and the location of her cyst. The cyst was large and situated near an important blood vessel which made her case more sensitive, requiring a more thorough approach to treatment. Therefore, her doctor decided she needed to have more detailed medical analyses. These included blood tests, imaging tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI depending on the nature of her cyst, and, in some intense cases, a biopsy to determine the exact makeup of the cyst.  On her visit to the doctor, Erin also had multiple consultations with different specialists, from a general surgeon to a radiologist, to ensure the team had the right battle plan in case her cyst was revealed to be malignant or adversely affect her normal functioning because of its location or potential growth.  Furthermore, her doctor wanted to monitor the cyst over time before deciding on the appropriate method of intervention. Erin, therefore, had more routine checkups scheduled in short intervals, including detailed discussions of the possible outcomes and treatment options such as drainage, medications, or surgical removal. These circumstances necessitated Erin to have a longer, more comprehensive visit to the doctor compared to Emily. Emily, on the other hand, had a smaller, more easily accessible cyst, which did not pose an immediate risk to her health. The cyst was located superficially and did not jeopardize any vital organs or structures within her body. After confirming its benign nature through some primary tests and initial evaluations, the doctor decided that Emily's cyst could be removed with a minor surgical procedure, which is less complex compared to Erin’s situation.  Emily's surgical process involved a simpler, in-office procedure that was less time-consuming compared to Erin's complex case. Emily was also given a brief recovery period and she required minimal follow-up care after the procedure. Her visits were less frequent and less comprehensive because her cyst was less complicated. The diversity and the complexity of Erin and Emily's cases, therefore, resulted in Erin having more thorough medical appointments compared to Emily, despite them both being treated for cyst removal."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...  answer the following question:  Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death?

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Input: Paragraph: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection has been a major threat to the poultry industry worldwide. Current commercially available ELISA kits detect group-specific antibodies; however, to understand the status of field infection, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) blocking ELISA (b-ELISA) against local IBVs was developed. The selected mAb showed specificity to Taiwan IBV strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain H120. Using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test as a standard, the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of a b-ELISA using this mAb were evaluated in 390 field samples. The typespecificity of detection was validated using a panel of chicken hyperimmune sera. The results showed that the b-ELISA demonstrated high sensitivity (98.0%) and specificity (97.2%) of detection. The agreement between the results of the b-ELISA and the HI test was statistically significant (Kappa = 0.95), and there was no significant difference between these two methods (McNemar p = 0.72). The b-ELISA specifically detected Taiwan IBV serotypes but not three non-Taiwan IBV serotypes nor sera against other avian pathogens. This b-ELISA provides type-specific antibody detection of local IBV strains. It has the potential to serve as a rapid and reliable diagnostic method for IBV clinical infections in the field in Taiwan.   Title: A type-specific blocking ELISA for the detection of infectious bronchitis virus antibody Output:","output":"True Justification: The paragraph discusses the development of a monoclonal antibody blocking ELISA (b-ELISA) that is specific to the detection of local Taiwan IBV strains, highlighting its high sensitivity, specificity, and performance when compared to the hemagglutination inhibition test. It also mentions its potential as a rapid and reliable diagnostic method for clinical IBV infections in Taiwan. The title \\"A type-specific blocking ELISA for the detection of infectious bronchitis virus antibody\\" accurately reflects the central theme of the paragraph, suggesting that it is suitable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The context behind this trade can be traced back to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a global conflict that involved major European powers of that time, such as Great Britain, France, and Spain. This war is often regarded as one of the first global wars in history since it included theaters of battle in Europe, North America, Central America, the West African coast, India, and the Philippines. In the aftermath of the war, several territories were exchanged among the belligerent nations through various treaties and agreements. One of those was the Treaty of Paris signed by Great Britain, France, and Spain on February 10, 1763. This treaty established the terms that effectively ended the Seven Years' War. In North America, France ceded all its territories to Great Britain, including present-day Canada and all the French territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain, on the other hand, had to cede Florida to Great Britain. As compensation for their losses, France transferred control of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi, to Spain.  When it comes to the exchange of Florida and Havana, it is essential to mention that during the war, the British had successfully seized Havana, a vital Spanish colony. Spain, realizing the strategic importance of Havana and its critical role in their empire, was eager to regain control over it. Thus, the Spanish government agreed to trade Florida with Britain in exchange for the return of Havana. This was formalized in the aforementioned Treaty of Paris. In conclusion, the statement given accurately represents the historical event whereby Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain. In exchange, they regained control of Havana, Cuba, which they had lost during the Seven Years' War. This event exemplifies the diplomatic and territorial exchanges that followed large-scale conflicts in the age of European empires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Determine the sentiment: After Racism, Rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away. Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums. While the handsome Joe Buck(Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, the poor Ratso Rizzo(Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida. Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can. They begin sharing everything in life. They share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny. Regrettably as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover Ratso cannot see Florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there. The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daylight. Thence, \\"Midnight\\" gives the factual sight. Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.","output":"To determine the sentiment of this text, I will analyze the tone and key opinions expressed in the passage. 1. The text discusses socio-political issues, specifically racism and rural exodus, using West Side Story and Midnight Cowboy as examples. This displays an informative tone and highlights the topic's importance. 2. The passage commends the director of Midnight Cowboy, stating he \\"skillfully deliver[s] us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums.\\" This signifies a positive sentiment towards the director's work. 3. While discussing the characters, the text mentions their dreams and the sacrifices they make for each other. This suggests a sympathetic and empathetic tone towards the characters, evoking a sense of compassion regarding their plights. 4. The text acknowledges the grievous ending — one of the characters dying — and comments that, despite the tragedy, Midnight Cowboy avoids melodrama. This signifies an appreciation for the film's portrayal of the characters' struggles and highlights a positive sentiment regarding this aspect of the film. 5. Lastly, the passage concludes by stating that Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of the socio-political issue of rural exodus. This signifies a positive sentiment towards the film for tackling such a challenging topic and providing a different perspective on it for viewers. Based on these points, I argue that the overall sentiment of this text is positive. While the text discusses the characters' struggles and tragic ends, it ultimately praises the film and its portrayal of the issues it examines. The review appreciates the director's skill in presenting these challenging themes and commends the film's ability to avoid melodrama while engaging with important socio-political issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: In May, Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association.  Does the answer correctly answer the question pick from the following. --yes --no","output":"A: No, the answer doesn't correctly answer the question. However, allow me to provide a detailed and long answer to your original question. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the second President of Egypt from 1956 to 1970, wanted to end several significant issues within the country that were holding it back from progressing. Nasser's key objectives can be summarized into four main areas: 1. Monarchy and political corruption: Nasser wanted to end the monarchy's rule in Egypt under King Farouk, who led a corrupt and ineffective government. The ongoing political corruption hindered the proper functioning of the state, increased social inequality, and prevented the nation from moving forward. To end this, Nasser and his fellow Free Officers staged a coup in 1952, which resulted in the abdication of King Farouk and the eventual establishment of a republic. 2. Colonial influence and foreign control: Nasser was highly against foreign involvement in Egypt's affairs, primarily due to British control over the Suez Canal and the suppression of Egyptian sovereignty. He aimed to end these colonial influences and regain national independence and pride. A major turning point in achieving this objective was Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956, leading to the Suez Crisis and ultimately reducing British and French control in the region. 3. Socio-economic disparities and feudalism: Egypt was plagued by large socio-economic disparities, with the majority of its population living in abject poverty, and a small elite controlling most of the wealth. The agricultural sector was dominated by a feudal system where wealthy landowners controlled vast tracts of land and exploited the peasant workforce. Nasser aimed to dismantle this feudal system and initiated a land reform program in 1952. This program redistributed land to landless peasants, imposed a ceiling on land ownership, and aimed to break the hold of the elite over the rural population. 4. Illiteracy and lack of education: Nasser wanted to end the widespread illiteracy and lack of education in Egypt. He believed that the key to modernizing the nation and ensuring its progress was through providing education to the masses. To this end, he implemented a series of educational reforms, making primary education free and compulsory. In addition, he expanded higher education by building new universities and introducing state-funded scholarships for Egyptian students to study abroad. In summary, Nasser aimed to end the monarchy's rule, political corruption, colonial influence, socio-economic disparities, and illiteracy in Egypt. He introduced a number of sweeping reforms to modernize the nation and promote social justice and national independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kenneth had a more difficult time climbing on the elephants back than Benjamin, because  Choices:  + Kenneth was nimble..  + Benjamin was nimble..","output":"Kenneth had a more difficult time climbing on the elephant's back than Benjamin, because Benjamin was nimble. From a young age, Benjamin had shown a natural talent for physical activities. He could run faster and jump higher than his peers, and his dexterity and agility were the envy of many of the children in their tight-knit community. When he wasn't playing sports or participating in some other physically taxing endeavor, Benjamin spent much of his time exploring the wilds around their village. This environment provided the perfect opportunity to hone his skills, allowing him to confidently navigate the often treacherous terrain. Kenneth, on the other hand, was more of a thinker. While he found a certain satisfaction in curling up with a good book or pondering the intricacies of mathematics, physical activity had always been something of a challenge for him. It's not that he was unfit, but he lacked the inherent grace and fluidity of movement that Benjamin possessed in spades. In truth, Kenneth could climb a tree or scale a rock face as well as the next person, but he would never be mistaken for an athlete. Despite the differences in their physical abilities, Kenneth and Benjamin shared a strong bond of friendship. They had been inseparable since they met in the village's tiny schoolhouse, where Benjamin quickly took it upon himself to draw the shy, bookish Kenneth out of his shell. Together, they explored a world that was equal parts learning and play, a mixture that seemed to delight them both to no end. It was this bond that had led the two friends to the elephant stables on that fateful day. The village, nestled in a lush valley near a majestic mountain range, had been the home of an elephant herding community for generations, and the massive animals were still a common sight in the region. Each year, as the hot summer drew to a close and the winds of autumn began to usher in cooler weather, the village would organize a grand celebration honoring these gentle giants. Kenneth and Benjamin had both been fascinated by the elephants from an early age, but they had never been allowed to approach them. These animals, after all, represented the livelihood of their community, and their keepers were eager to protect them from the curiosity of overzealous children. Even so, on that day, with the excitement of the coming celebration in the air, the two boys couldn't resist the urge to get a closer look. When they saw that the stable doors had been left open, the temptation became too great to resist, and they approached the curious creatures cautiously, a sense of wonder welling up within them. As one of the gentle giants extended its great, trunk-like nose in their direction, Benjamin's nimbleness became apparent. Nary a moment after the first tentative touch, he nimbly scaled the creature's leg and hoisted himself onto its back, his eyes wide with the thrill of a new experience. Kenneth, meanwhile, hesitated as he took in the scale of the enormous beast before him. He knew he would need to muster all of his courage and strength to climb atop the elephant, but he was determined not to let his friend down. Gripping the thick, leathery skin, Kenneth tried his best to mimic Benjamin's movements, but the sheer enormity of the task seemed to sap the strength from his limbs. With each failed attempt, Kenneth could feel the frustration mounting within him. He took a deep breath, reminding himself that persistence was the key to success. And as his gaze met Benjamin's encouraging smile from high atop the elephant's back, Kenneth knew he would find a way to join his friend in their shared adventure. Summoning every ounce of courage he possessed, Kenneth made one final leap. This time, his fingers locked onto a fold of skin, allowing him to pull himself up and onto the massive creature's back. Exhausted but triumphant, Kenneth collapsed beside his friend, their shared laughter echoing through the stables as they began an unforgettable journey atop their newfound elephant companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of person that designed a cenotaph that is in front of the building that was purchased by the Texas Legislature in the 20th century? is inside the article: Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time.  Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three.  From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian.  The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance.   Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation.  Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own.  Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans.  In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world.  In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films. Most English-language treatments reflect the perspectives of the Anglos and are centered primarily on the battle of the Alamo.

It lasted for over 3000 years from 3150 BC to 30 BC. Looking nice and being clean was very important to the Egyptians. Most men and women wore jewelry  of some type. The rich wore jewelry made of gold and silver, while the poorer people used copper. Because it was so hot, most people wore white clothes. Men wore kilts  and women wore a straight dress. Ancient Egypt was a complex society needing people to do many different tasks and jobs. Most of the people were farmers. They grew their crops near the banks of the Nile River where the rich black soil was good for crops. There were different kinds of craftsmen jobs. How skilled a craftsman was would determine his success. Most of the soldiers were footmen. In peacetime, soldiers would help with government projects such as moving stones for a pyramid . Scribes were important people in Ancient Egypt as they were the only people who know how to read and write.

A) Most people in Ancient Egypt were farmers who cultivated crops near the banks of the Nile River. B) Cleanliness and aesthetics were of no significance to the Egyptians. C) The soldiers in peacetime would assist with government projects, such as moving stones for a pyramid. D) Only scribes, who usually came from wealthy families and underwent years of training, knew how to read and write Egyptian hieroglyphics.  Steps and justifications: 1) First, I identified key facts from the text that could be used to construct meaningful answer choices for a multiple-choice question. These include the importance of appearance to the Egyptians, the common occupation of farming, the role of soldiers in peacetime, and the exclusive knowledge of reading and writing hieroglyphics among the scribes.  2) Then, I formulated a question that requires understanding of all these facts. As the question being asked is about a false statement, each answer choice can reflect different facts from the article. 3) Hence, for answer choices A, C, and D, I paraphrased the information directly from the article. For answer choice B, I reversed the information about the importance of appearance to the Egyptians to make it a false statement. 4) This question format requires the respondent to distinguish between accurate representations of the text and distorted or incorrect ones, thereby testing their comprehension and recall of the article content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Former Rangers boss Walter Smith admits he should never have joined Charles Green's Ibrox board. And the nine-titles-in-a-row manager also confessed he should have walked away much sooner before he did finally quit in August 2013. The 66-year-old returned to the club in November 2012 after being appointed a non-executive director by then chief executive Green - and he was then handed the chairmanship six months later. Walter Smith has revealed he regrets not leaving the Rangers board before August 2013. Former Rangers boss Smith has ruled out the possibility of replacing Ally McCoist. But he soon resigned as he accused the Yorkshireman and former directors Brian Stockbridge and Bryan Smart of creating a 'highly dysfunctional environment' inside the Ibrox boardroom. However, speaking at the launch of former Rangers Director of Communications Jim Traynor's new PR firm Level 5, Smith said: 'Everybody talks about it being chaotic. Everybody can make up their minds about what happened. It was chaotic enough for me to resign. 'For my own embarrassment I maybe held on a bit too long. I should have resigned long before I did. 'But that happens. It was an error on my own part to get involved.' He added: 'Would I have done anything differently? Yeah, I probably wouldn't have joined the board at all. Why? Just the way everything turned out. 'I felt at the time that if I could help the club in any way with the circumstances it was in, it was the right time to do so. 'As it turns out, after a couple of months I discovered it wasn't the right time and I had to leave. 'That was my decision and I found out the boardroom aspect was a circumstance I wasn't particularly comfortable in.' Former Scotland manager Craig Brown reckons Smith should return to Ibrox for a third stint as boss now that Ally McCoist has been put on gardening leave. Smith won 10 Scottish titles during his time at Rangers and led the Scottish side to the 2008 Uefa Cup final. Craig Brown believes Smith should return to the club as manager following the departure of McCoist. But Smith - who won 10 Scottish titles and led the Light Blues to the final of the Uefa Cup in 2008 - said: 'I will go back to Ibrox to games but not in any official capacity. 'I wouldn't go back onto the board either. I have learned it is an environment I am not particularly comfortable in.' Green has now departed the scene but chaos continues to reign at Rangers. American financier Robert Sarver has pulled the plug on takeover talks after accusing the board of ignoring his requests for dialogue. That leaves the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - and oldco director Dave King to battle it out with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for control of the Glasgow giants. Smith insists he does not know what direction the club will take next, but does reckon Park's group would unite the Ibrox faithful. He said: 'The ideal outcome would be for Rangers to get back to where they were a number of years ago, challenging for the title, as quickly as possible. That's what every Rangers fan wants. 'How they get there I don't know. 'I don't know enough about what is going on in the background at the present moment to support one and not the other. 'I just wish everybody would get together and rid Rangers of the problems we have had. 'Can Douglas Park bring stability back to club and win over the fans' trust? Of course he can. He would do that as somebody known to supporters. 'But whoever comes in has to bring that back to Rangers, whether they are American or Scottish. They have to bring an element of trust back into the club again because supporters are now showing they are unhappy with what is going on. 'The trust issue is the big factor and the people who have been involved in this at the moment are the ones who the Rangers supporters would trust.'","output":"Former Rangers manager Walter Smith has expressed regret over joining Charles Green's Ibrox board and not resigning sooner than August 2013.

Does \\"Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"As relationships between people and dogs got closer, what happened to the art that had dogs in it?\\"","output":"Yes, the given statement \\"Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed.\\" does contain the correct answer to the question \\"As relationships between people and dogs got closer, what happened to the art that had dogs in it?\\" To provide a detailed and long answer to the question, as relationships between people and dogs grew closer, artists gradually began to depict dogs more intricately in their artwork. This development in the representation of dogs in art corresponds with both the evolution of individual dog breeds and the deepening bond between humans and canines. In early human history, dogs primarily served practical purposes, such as hunting partners, guardians, and herders. As such, the representations of dogs in art during these times were less detailed and focused on showcasing their utilitarian aspects. In many ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, dogs were depicted in wall paintings and sculptures as simple and generic symbols of loyalty, protection, and companionship. However, as people and dogs developed closer relationships through domestication, human societies began to breed dogs for specific purposes, resulting in a diversity of breeds with unique physical appearances, personalities, and abilities. Consequently, artists started to portray dogs more elaborately in their artwork to reflect this diversity and celebrate the unique characteristics of different breeds. During the Renaissance period, the depiction of dogs in art became even more sophisticated. Artists began to pay closer attention to anatomical accuracy, capturing subtle differences in breeds' physical features, fur textures, and expressions. This was a reflection of the increased appreciation for dogs as companions, status symbols, and pets among the upper classes in Europe. As the bond between humans and dogs continued to strengthen, artists also began to explore the emotional and psychological dimensions of the relationship. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an increase in sentimental paintings featuring dogs as loyal companions, protectors of vulnerable family members, or as symbolic representations of human qualities such as faithfulness and devotion. In contemporary art, dogs continue to be a popular subject that reflects the ongoing importance of the human-canine relationship. Artists today portray dogs in a wide variety of styles, ranging from highly detailed and realistic to whimsical and abstract, demonstrating the profound impact dogs have on human lives and culture across time periods and artistic movements. In conclusion, as the relationships between humans and dogs grew closer, the art featuring dogs evolved to become more elaborate, reflecting the development of individual breeds and the deepening emotional connections between people and their canine companions. This artistic evolution highlights the significance of dogs in human history and the profound respect and appreciation for these animals that continues to shape art and culture today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Club leader Sean (Andre Gower), whose five-year-old sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank) desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jack Gwillim) - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick (Robby Kiger), and the rest of the Monster Squad visit an elderly man, known as the \\"Scary German Guy\\" (Leonardo Cimino), actually a kind gentleman, to translate the diary. When the Monster Squad wonders how the German man is knowledgeable about Van Helsing's battle with monsters, he wryly comments that \\"he has some experience with monsters\\" and his shirt sleeve briefly reveals a concentration camp tattoo.The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the prelude, van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world and plunge it into darkness.

Please answer the following question: No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do. Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof. Bowled over by their praise – he is a man whose emotions are close to the surface – Krzysztof asked if he could give them a hug, probably a... Question: Why did they sing to the inspectors? Options: - It is a common thing to sing at Drumduan   - not enough information   - the students wanted sing part of, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe   - the inspectors were alarmed and needed to calm down === The correct answer is A:","output":"It is a common thing to sing at Drumduan. At Drumduan Upper School, singing and music play a significant role in the educational experience of the students. The school, which emphasizes Steiner education principles, focuses on engaging and nurturing the individual strengths and interests of each student. As a result, creative expression and performing arts, including singing, are highly valued curriculum components. In the particular situation described in the text, Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, decided to have the students sing to the inspectors. The decision was fueled by their rehearsal of \\"Media Vita,\\" a captivating medieval score. Krzysztof felt strongly that the inspectors should hear the beauty of the song, which ultimately led to an emotive moment at the school and showcased the unique aspects of Drumduan's educational approach. The singing also highlighted the students' talent, dedication, and passion for music, contributing to the positive impression given to the inspectors. In summary, the reason they chose to sing to the inspectors was because singing is an integral and common part of the Drumduan Upper School experience, and in the specific situation, the song's beauty, as well as its potential to showcase the school's unique educational approach, convinced Krzysztof to seize the opportunity to share it with the inspectors."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about hee-seop choi  can be gathered from the following bio?

These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as \\"BD\\"s, an abbreviation of \\"bandes dessinées\\" (literally \\"drawn strips\\") in French and \\"stripverhalen\\" (literally \\"strip stories\\") or simply \\"strips\\" in Dutch. Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style, both in art as well as in spirit.   - Yvan Delporte ( 24 June 1928 -- 5 March 2007 ) was a Belgian comics writer , and was editor - in - chief of Spirou magazine between 1955 and 1968 during a period considered by many the golden age of Franco - Belgian comics . He is credited with several creative contributions , among these his collaborations with Peyo on The Smurfs , with René Follet on Steve Severin ( 1/2 ) and André Franquin with the creation of Gaston Lagaffe and the co-authorship of Idées noires .  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Belgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \\"an integral part of Belgian culture\\".  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - René Follet (born 10 April 1931), sometimes known by the pen name Ref, is a Belgian illustrator, comics writer and artist.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.    'yvan delporte' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'country of citizenship'?

(2) The novel was adapted in 2008 by Lu Kemp as BBC Radio 4 book near Bedtime , read by Toby Stephens and produced by Kirsty Williams . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences convey similar information, they are not exactly the same in terms of meaning and structure. Let's break down the differences for better understanding: Sentence 1: - The novel was read by Kirsty Williams - The adaptation was done by Toby Stephens - BBC Radio 4 is mentioned as \\"Bedtime Book\\" - The producer was Lu Kemp Sentence 2: - The novel was read by Toby Stephens - The adaptation was done by Lu Kemp in 2008 - BBC Radio 4 is mentioned as \\"book near Bedtime\\" - The producer was Kirsty Williams When comparing the two sentences, we can identify the following differences: 1. Role Assignments: In the first sentence, Kirsty Williams is mentioned as the person who read the novel, and Toby Stephens is noted for adapting it. However, in the second sentence, Toby Stephens is responsible for reading the novel, and Lu Kemp takes care of adapting it. This discrepancy in role assignment is the most crucial and creates a difference in meaning between the two sentences. 2. Production Year: The second sentence mentions a specific year for the adaptation, which is 2008. This information is not provided in the first sentence, so we cannot imply the same date. 3. Program Name: The two sentences use slightly different names to describe the BBC Radio 4 program. The first sentence refers to it as the \\"Bedtime Book,\\" while the second uses \\"book near Bedtime.\\" Though we can assume it's the same program, the difference in wording creates slight ambiguity. 4. Producer: In the first sentence, Lu Kemp is stated as the producer of the adaptation, while in the second sentence, Kirsty Williams is assigned this role. This change in role responsibilities also creates meaning differences between the sentences. In summary, while both sentences share similarities, such as being related to the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of a novel, they have different meanings due to the differences in role assignments, production year, program name, and producer. It is essential to identify these variations when comparing the two sentences and understanding their meanings accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As he threatens the owner with indictment over finding rat droppings in the food, the other employees quietly slip out to the parking lot and smash Matthew's windshield with a bottle of wine. Matthew is cold and calculating, refusing to let them see his frustration at finding his car vandalized, but when he gets home he calls Elizabeth. They work together at the health department, and Matthew jokes with her about what happened to him at the restaurant. As Elizabeth goes to bed, she forgets about the weird pod, which has suddenly sprouted roots in the glass of water she keeps it in next to their bed.When Elizabeth wakes the next morning, Geoffrey is already awake and dressed, cleaning up the remains of the glass of water next to the bed, as well as some other, unidentifiable mess (resembling some kind of dust). His behavior is strange, and she follows him downstairs as he takes a plastic garbage bag out to a waiting dump truck. At work, she confides to Matthew that Geoffrey is acting strange. Later that night, Elizabeth tries to talk it over with Geoffrey but he ignores her, instead telling her that he's going out and giving her no explanation. Elizabeth touches him...

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hopkins was born at 512 Tenth Street in Sioux City, Iowa, the fourth child of four sons and one daughter of David Aldona and Anna (nee Pickett) Hopkins. His father, born in Bangor, Maine, ran a harness shop (after an erratic career as a salesman, prospector, storekeeper and bowling-alley operator), but his real passion was bowling, and he eventually returned to it as a business. Anna Hopkins, born in Hamilton, Ontario, had moved at an early age to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she married David. She was deeply religious and active in the affairs of the Methodist church. In March 1933, Roosevelt summoned Hopkins to Washington as federal relief administrator. Convinced that paid work was psychologically more valuable than cash handouts, Hopkins sought to continue and expand New York State's work-relief programs, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. He supervised the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Over 90% of the people employed by the Hopkins programs were unemployed or on relief. He feuded with Harold Ickes, who ran a rival program--the Public Works Administration--which also created jobs but did not require applicants to be unemployed or on relief.  FERA, the largest program from 1933 to 1935, involved giving money to localities to operate work relief projects to employ those on direct relief. CWA was similar but did not require workers to be on relief in order to receive a government sponsored job. In less than four months, the CWA hired four million people, and during its five months of operation, the CWA built and repaired 200 swimming pools, 3,700 playgrounds, 40,000 schools, 250,000 miles (400,000 km) of road, and 12 million feet of sewer pipe.  The WPA, which followed the CWA, employed 8.5 million people in its seven-year history, working on 1.4 million projects, including the building or repair of 103 golf courses, 1,000 airports, 2,500 hospitals, 2,500 sports stadiums, 3,900 schools, 8,192 parks, 12,800 playgrounds, 124,031 bridges, 125,110 public buildings, and 651,087 miles (1,047,823 km) of highways and roads. The WPA operated on its own, and on selected projects in cooperation with local and state governments, but always with its own staff and budget. Hopkins started programs for youth (National Youth Administration) and for artists and writers (Federal One Programs). He and Eleanor Roosevelt worked together to publicize and defend New Deal relief programs. He was concerned with rural areas but increasingly focused on cities in the Great Depression.  Before Hopkins began to decline from his struggle with stomach cancer in the late 1930s, FDR appeared to be training him as a possible successor. With the advent of World War II in Europe, however, FDR himself ran again in 1940, winning an unprecedented third term. What did CWA stand for?","output":"CWA stood for Civil Works Administration.

After decades of skimpy skirts and sleeveless tops on game days, some schools in the US are saying cheerleader uniforms will have to meet stricter dress codes when they are worn in class.  In Lake County, Florida, cheerleaders with uniforms too skimpy for the code are being asked to wear long shorts or trousers under their skirts and a T-shirt under the sleeveless tops, according to a district memo. Principals at two of Lake's eight high schools - Leesburg and Lake Minneola - are not allowing the outfits in school at all.  Michelle Thomas, a cheerleader at Leesburg High School, was disappointed when she learned she couldn't wear her outfit to school on game days.  \\"It shows that we're a team just like all the other sports,\\" she said.  But the school administrators did not agree. \\"During the educational portion of the day, they have to meet the dress code just like every other student,\\" said school board chairwoman Debbie Stivender, who ordered the staff to bring the outfits into line with the dress code.  Bare midriffs are banned across the state by the Florida High School Athletic Association, but no state rules mention cheerleader miniskirts. Sheila Noone, a spokeswoman for cheerleading uniform company Varsity Brands, says the outfits haven't become more revealing over the last 10 years. She says that the short skirts are designed to help the girls jump and kick.  \\"Cheerleading is athletic,\\" Noone said. \\"There's a lot of jumping, so you won't want a knee-length skirt that might hamper a tie touch.\\"  Most cheerleaders were sad to hear the news, but say they'll follow the rules. Even male cheerleaders, whose pants and tops meet dress codes, chose not to wear their outfits to show unity.  \\"I understanding, because they are kind of short,\\" said Holly Bishop, 14, a Lake Minneola High School cheerleader, about her miniskirt. \\"It would have been really, really cool to wear them to school.\\" Based on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions. 1. cheerleader uniforms will have to meet stricter dress codes 2.

Rating: ★★★★★ - Exceptional From the very moment that the Town Bistro's intricately carved door swung open with a warm welcome, it was clear that my dining experience would be nothing short of spectacular. The place exudes an irresistible charm that can only be attributed to the delicate fusion of vintage aesthetics and modern vibrancy. The interior is a beautifully melodic symphony of elan and comfort. Each table is adorned with a vibrant view of the bustling town life outside while still preserving the intimate ambiance inside. The warm hues and soft indirect lighting, coupled with the ambient music, set a comforting and intimate mood that entices diners in. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the immaculately dressed and courteous staff who, despite the busy hour, ushered us to our table with swift efficiency. Their professionalism coupled with the friendly demeanor immediately put us at ease - a testament to the stellar service that would follow. And then came the pièce de résistance – the Food. The menu, an impressive collection of dishes that spanned from comfort classics to culinary innovations, boasted an array of options that catered to the palate of the discerning and adventurous alike. Their dedication to sourcing locally grown, quality ingredients for their dishes was both impressive and evident in the fresh, vibrant flavors that graced our taste buds. The highlight of our meal undoubtedly was the signature dish - the Herb Crusted Salmon. Served over a bed of perfectly seasoned quinoa, the salmon was cooked to perfection with an exquisite balance of flavors - a melody of mild herbs enveloped by the rich, buttery texture of the salmon. Each forkful was a testament to the chef's prowess and passion for their work. And let's not ignore the equally exceptional drinks selection. The wine list was extensive, boasting an array of robust reds and light-bodied whites, charting different regions across the globe. My dining partner and I decided on the recommended house white, a crisp and fruity complement to our salmon dish. To finish off, we indulged in the in-house specialty dessert – the Classic Tiramisu. It was a dreamy concoction of airy mascarpone cream, interspersed with perfectly soaked ladyfingers and finished off with a dusting of cocoa. The dessert was an exquisite balance of rich creaminess and the bold flavor of coffee, a delightful finale to our meal. In conclusion, The Town Bistro offers an incomparable dining experience. The brilliant fusion of ambiance, customer service, and most importantly, the culinary ingenuity is simply unmatched. This place truly stands as a beacon of excellence in the culinary map of the town.

If \\"A young child with brown curly hair and brown eyes sits in a foldaway chair on the sidewalk.\\", does this mean that \\"A child sitting on a chair outside\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"A young child with brown curly hair and brown eyes sits in a foldaway chair on the sidewalk\\" essentially means that \\"A child is sitting on a chair outside\\". It is just a more descriptive and detailed way of expressing the same idea. The simplified version omits certain specific details, but the core meaning remains the same: a child is sitting on a chair outside. Let's break down and analyze the original phrase to better understand its various components: 1. \\"A young child\\": The phrase specifies that the subject is a young child, making it clear that we are talking about a child and not an adult or older individual. 2. \\"with brown curly hair and brown eyes\\": This part adds details about the child's physical appearance, particularly focusing on their hair and eye color. These details help paint a more vivid picture of the child in the reader's mind. 3. \\"sits in a foldaway chair\\": The action of sitting is described here, along with the kind of chair the child is sitting on. A foldaway chair is a portable and collapsible chair often used for outdoor events or activities. The description of the chair implies that the chair can be easily set up or put away if needed, perhaps suggesting a temporary or transient nature of the situation. 4. \\"on the sidewalk\\": Lastly, this portion of the phrase indicates the location where the child is sitting. In this case, it is the sidewalk, a paved path typically found alongside streets or roads for pedestrians to walk. This detail confirms that the child is indeed outside, thus aligning with the simplified phrase's core idea. In conclusion, the phrase \\"A child sitting on a chair outside\\" captures the essence of the original statement, only in a less detailed and descriptive manner. Both phrases convey the same general meaning, but the original phrase provides a more vivid and detailed mental image of the scenario."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In much society, there is often greater acceptance of light skin than dark skin; Light skin may be seen as a mark of beauty, intelligence and success. These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others. The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care  products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier  to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections  and serious skin damage. And these are not the only problems.

Article: Three astronauts returned to Earth safely on Wednesday after a successful 15-day mission  , marking another step forward towards the country's goal of building a manned space station by 2020. Zhang Youxia, commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, said the Shenzhou X mission was a \\"complete success\\". The Shenzhou X landed safely in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at about 8:07 a.m. on June 26, 2013. All three astronauts were in good physical condition. Nie Haisheng, commander of the Shenzhou X crew and a second-time space traveler, was the first to get out of the bowl-like module , followed by Wang Yaping, the only female astronaut of the mission, and Zhang Xiaoguang. During a brief welcoming ceremony held at the landing area, the astronauts waved happily to a crowd consisting of officers, the search and recovery team, and health personnel. \\"It feels really good to be back home,\\" said astronaut Nie Haisheng. \\"We are dreamers, and we have now realized our dream,\\" said Zhang Xiaoguang. \\"Our space dream knows no limit, and our hard work will never stop,\\" he said. Compared with its previous mission Shenzhou IX last year, the Shenzhou X is no longer experimental but considered an applicable shuttle system for sending astronauts and supplies to orbiting modules. The mission aims to further test technologies designed for docking and supporting astronauts' stay in space, as well as to use new technologies related to the construction of a space station. In its 15-day journey in space, Shenzhou X docked with the orbiting space lab Tiangong-1 twice, once through automatic operation and the other manual .The Tiangong-1 space lab has been in orbit for more than 600 days.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who drove the vessel that picked up the James Caird party? from the following article ?  Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island.

Summarize this article: Your weekly split, or training schedule, organizes the individual parts of your training. Assign specific days for cardio workouts, agility and combination drills, weight training, and active rest activities. Your routine could look like this:  Monday: Slow long distance run, boxing workout (foot and combination drills). Tuesday: Upper body weight training (such as 4-5 sets of 15-20 push-ups and sit-ups, 2 sets of 10 pull-ups, or a circuit of upper body resistance weight training machines). Wednesday: Rest (optional: yoga, Tai Chi, or light aerobic activity). Thursday: High intensity interval runs, boxing workout (foot and combination drills). Friday: Slow long distance run, lower body weight training (such as 3 sets of 5 weighted squats, 3 sets of 10 to 15 weighted calf raises, 2 sets of 20 weighted lunges, or a circuit of lower body resistance weight training machines). Saturday: High intensity interval runs, boxing workout (foot and combination drills). Sunday: Rest (optional: yoga, Tai Chi, or light aerobic activity). On your weekly split’s boxing days, start with jumping rope for 3 sets of 3 minutes to warm up. Perform 4 sets of 2 minute foot drills (4 sets each of left, right, forward, backward, box, and circle foot drills). Do 5 rounds of combination drills at 3 minutes per round, then cool down with another jump rope routine.  You can do 1 combination per round (1-2-3 for an entire round and 1-3 for another whole round), or mix up multiple combinations in a single round. Rest less than 30 seconds between activities. Build your endurance by running for as long as you can. If you’re in great aerobic shape, you might be able to go 90 minutes. If you’re not used to long distance runs, start with light jogging for 20 minutes. Your pace shouldn’t be too intense. The Talk Test is a good way to gauge your run’s intensity. You should be able to use complete phrases, but have to take a deep breath between phrases. If you’re too winded to speak, your pace is too intense. If you don’t have to take deep breaths, you should run harder. High intensity interval training involves alternating periods of intense running with active recovery. Warm up by jogging lightly for 5 minutes, then run at about 90 percent of your maximum speed for 1 minute. Actively recover by jogging for 2 to 3 minutes, then do another 90 percent interval.  Include 6 to 8 seconds of intense sprints in your 90 percent intervals. Do 20 minutes of interval training, including 5 minutes of easy jogging to cool down. Add variety to your routine with 1 to 2 hours of an aerobic activity, such as swimming, cycling, rowing, or hiking. You can do an aerobic activity instead of a run or do one on an active rest day. An active rest day is incorporated in weekly splits to stimulate the recovery process. It gives  you a break from more intense workouts, but helps you stay in gear for your next day of training. In addition to cardio, agility, and combination drills, include strength training workouts at least 2 days per week. Perform upper body, core, and lower body exercises, including push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, squats, lunges, and calf raises. Focus on 1 section of your body per day, such as upper body on Tuesdays and legs on Thursdays. or Tai Chi on active rest days. In addition to swimming and other aerobic activities, yoga and Tai Chi are excellent active rest options. They can help you sharpen your focus, develop breath control, and improve flexibility.  Find a local yoga or Tai Chi studio, take classes at your gym or YMCA, or look online for instructional videos. If possible, use resistance exercise machines at home or the gym. Boxers train at a high level, so ask your doctor if a routine that involves intense aerobic exercise is right for you. It’s especially important to talk to your doctor if you have a history of heart, bone, joint, or other medical issues. Don’t push yourself beyond your limits, and decrease intensity if you’re just starting to train. For example, instead of doing 5 rounds of combination drills, do 3 rounds and take a longer break between each set.  Do 20 minute long slow distance runs instead of 90 minute runs, and 7 to 12 minutes of high intensity interval training instead of 20. If you’re more advanced, do multiple activities in a single day, such as a slow long distance run and boxing drills on Mondays. If you’re a beginner, do a single activity per day.

Product review: The idea of a \\"country\\" performer performing rock is not new in country music. Many were doing it before they knew there was such a thing. Many artists who were big in country tried it on as rock. Buck Owens became \\"Corky Jones\\" and George Jones tried it on as \\"Thumper Jones\\". So, even though I'm not a big Garth fan, quit criticizing the man for trying it on as a rock star. My criticism would be, though, he's finally showing his true colors. The man claims KISS as one of his influences-very far removed from country. The man has never been capable of anything but watered down country to start with, so why should this thing be a suprise?","output":"This review seems to be quite mixed in its sentiment towards the product, which appears to be an album or performance by Garth Brooks venturing into rock music. The reviewer acknowledges that this fusion of genres is not a new phenomenon, citing historical examples, and discourages others from criticizing Garth Brooks for trying out a new style. However, the reviewer also expresses their personal negative opinion about Garth Brooks' music, stating that he has \\"never been capable of anything but watered down country.\\" They also mention that the artist claims KISS as an influence, which is far removed from the country genre.

Article: When I was six, my mother placed me in a boarding home. For the next nine years, I never slept in a room that contained less than 30 other kids in it. So, when I was promoted to senior at the high school for my final year there, I had the greatest pleasure of rooming with just one other classmate, and the added feature of a semi-private bathroom. We seniors also had the feature of walking around the campus in special hats, we called senior bonnets. So all the other kids would know we were the highest in the high school. As seniors, we frequently went on field trips outside the campus, including city museums, city hall, colleges and theatres. The highlight was a senior class trip to Washington, D.C., where we sat in on a session of Congress, visited the monument and many other government sites around the city. Another benefit of being seniors was that many of us on athletic and other extra-curricular teams were elected to high ranking for the year. I had the honor and pleasure of being chosen captain of our state championship swim team, while my roommate was voted president of the drama club. Graduation services were on a sunny day in June. Each of us had looked forward to this moment for ten years. Now we were going out on our own to complete freedom, and we should have been flooded with joy. However, to my surprise, I found myself crying, something I hadn't done for years. I noticed many of my classmates usually proud of their macho guy  attitudes, were also wiping away tears. We knew we would never be together again as we were on that graduation day. Our senior year ended with deep feelings of sadness for our loss, as well as joy for our emerging into a new world beyond the school campus.

Kelly, who has amassed a cult following thanks in large part to the steady stream of photos from space he posted to social media, said Friday that he will retire from NASA effective April 1. “Our universe is a big place, and we have many millions of miles yet to explore. My departure from NASA is my next step on that journey,” Kelly said in a Facebook post. Kelly, who turned 52 in February, returned from his year-long mission earlier this month, earning himself the American record for most time spent in space. He orbited the earth 5,440 times — traveling an estimated 143,846,525 miles — and conducted three spacewalks during that trip. He also became something of a celebrity along the way. From space, Kelly appeared on early-morning and late-night television and posted hundreds of photos to Twitter, amassing more than 1 million followers. But his primary mission was to help further NASA’s understanding of the effects of extended time in space on the human body. “In his year aboard the space station, he took part in experiments that will have far-reaching effects, helping us pave the way to putting humans on Mars and benefiting life on Earth,” Brian Kelly, director of Flight Operations at NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, said in a statement. Scott Kelly previously visited space in 1999, 2007 and 2010. [Even after a year in orbit, Scott Kelly is still grounded] He joined the U.S. Navy in 1987 and NASA in 1996. And while he plans to retire in just a few weeks, Kelly said his will continue to work with the space agency. “I remain ever committed and dedicated to the service of human exploration and advancement whether in space or on Earth,” he said. “… I will provide periodic medical samples and support other testing in much the same way that my twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, has made himself available for the Twins Study throughout this past mission.” Astronaut Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station, longer than any American astronaut. Here's a look at the year he spent in space, through his eyes above Earth. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Kelly was born in New Jersey in 1964 and is a graduate of the State University of New York Maritime College and the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Question: Despite my blog name, I’m not actually all that adventurous. Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn’t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures.

DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

In an animated sequence, a plane flying through the fictional Bukuvu region in the heart of Africa crashes. A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees, has grown to be King of the Jungle. Ursula Stanhope, a San Francisco heiress, tours Uganda with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters. Ursula is tracked down and joined by her fiancé, Lyle Van De Groot, with two poachers named Max and Thor. Kwame tells the group of the \\"White Ape\\", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the jungle. The next day Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee while Ursula is saved by George. George takes Ursula to his treehouse home and cares for her, introducing her to Shep, an African bush elephant that acts like George's dog, and Tookie, a toco toucan.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involving sugar entering the body, its transport through the bloodstream, the pancreas releasing insulin to lower sugar levels, is the conversion and storage of excess glucose for future use by the body in the form of glycogen. This entire process can be broadly described as follows: 1. Sugar enters the body: When we consume food containing carbohydrates, such as sugar, these carbohydrates are broken down into smaller units called glucose during the digestion process. Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for our cells. 2. Glucose enters the bloodstream: The glucose produced during digestion is then absorbed into the blood through the small intestine. As a result, the blood glucose levels increase. This is important as the body requires a constant supply of glucose to function properly, especially our brain cells. 3. Pancreas releases insulin: The pancreas, an essential organ in the body, plays a key role in maintaining blood glucose levels. When the pancreas detects the rise in blood glucose levels, it produces a hormone called insulin. Insulin acts as a key that allows glucose to enter cells and be utilized as a source of energy. 4. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels: The primary function of insulin is to lower blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake by cells, particularly in muscles, liver, and fat tissue. As a result, glucose is removed from the bloodstream and used by the cells for energy, thus lowering the overall blood sugar levels. 5. Conversion and storage of excess glucose as glycogen: The last step of the process is the conversion and storage of excess glucose for future use. The liver and muscles can store a limited amount of glucose in the form of glycogen - a compound in which multiple glucose molecules are connected to form a branched structure. When blood glucose levels are high, insulin promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which can be stored for future use. When blood glucose levels fall, such as during fasting or exercise, the stored glycogen is converted back into glucose under the influence of another hormone called glucagon and is released into the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose levels within an optimal range. In summary, the last step of the process involving sugar metabolism in the body is the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen and its storage in liver and muscle cells. This step not only helps maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range but also serves as an essential energy reserve for the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who had a procedure that took 55 minutes and was a complete success?, using the article: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Background: Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Context: Along with Francois Couperin, Rameau is one of the two masters of the French school of harpsichord music in the 18th century. Both composers made a decisive break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists, who confined their compositions to the relatively fixed mould of the classical suite. This reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century with successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clerambault, Jean-Francois Dandrieu, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart, and Nicolas Siret.  Rameau and Couperin have different styles. They seem not to have known one another (Couperin was one of the official court musicians while Rameau was still an unknown; fame would only come to him after Couperin's death). Rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 while Couperin (who was fifteen years his senior) waited until 1713 before publishing his first \\"ordres.\\" Rameau's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the French suite: imitative (\\"Le rappel des oiseaux,\\" \\"La poule\\") and character (\\"Les tendres plaintes\\", \\"L'entretien des Muses\\") pieces and works of pure virtuosity that resemble Scarlatti (\\"Les tourbillons,\\" \\"Les trois mains\\") as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator (\\"L'Enharmonique\\", \\"Les Cyclopes\\"), which had a marked influence on Daquin, Royer, and Jacques Duphly. The suites are grouped in the traditional way, by key.  Rameau's three collections appeared in 1706, 1724 and 1726 or 1727, respectively. After this, he only composed a single piece for the harpsichord: \\"La Dauphine\\" (1747). Other works, such as \\"Les petits marteaux,\\" have been doubtfully attributed to him.  During his semiretirement in the years 1740 to 1744, he wrote the Pieces de clavecin en concert (1741), which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. Adopting a formula successfully employed by Mondonville a few years earlier, these pieces differ from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany other instruments (the violin, flute or viol) playing the melody but has an equal part in the \\"concert\\" with them. Rameau also claimed that the pieces would be equally satisfying as solo harpsichord works--although this statement is far from convincing, since the composer took the trouble to transcribe five of them himself--those where the lack of other instruments would show the least. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. The article discusses the development of French harpsichord music in the 18th century and how Rameau and Couperin played major roles in shaping its style and repertoire. Despite not having a personal relationship, the two composers complemented each other in defining the French school of harpsichord music. 2. Rameau's versatility as a composer is highlighted, ranging from traditional French suites, character pieces, and virtuosic works to experimental and innovative compositions influenced by his theoretical background. This variety in his music allowed him to have a profound impact on subsequent French composers like Daquin, Royer, and Duphly. 3. The article mentions Rameau's collections of harpsichord pieces, published in 1706, 1724, and 1726 or 1727, showing different stages of his compositional growth and the development of the French harpsichord repertoire. Moreover, it highlights his single composition \\"La Dauphine\\" in 1747 and the uncertainty about the attribution of some other pieces like \\"Les petits marteaux.\\" 4. During his semiretirement, Rameau composed the Pieces de clavecin en concert (1741), which is considered by some musicologists to be the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. The innovative aspect of these pieces is that the harpsichord takes on an equal role with the other instruments in the ensemble (violin, flute, or viol) rather than merely providing the basso continuo. 5. Rameau's claim that the Pieces de clavecin en concert could be equally satisfying as solo harpsichord works is an interesting aspect mentioned in the article. However, the fact that he transcribed some of these pieces himself indicates that he might have had some doubts about the effectiveness of these works as true solo pieces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the chaos of the assassination attempts, Matt's friend, Andrew, called Eliot Arnold, Matt's father. Upon arriving to pick up Matt from the Herk's, Eliot immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk, Jenny's mother, as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herk's housemaid, Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young homeless man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen. Realizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers to buy a rocket but is sold a suitcase nuclear bomb because the dealer claims to be out of rockets and doesn't tell him that it is a nuclear weapon.

Earlier this month, the five women were sentenced to 45 days of house arrest for living in Pakistan illegally. Their detention ended last week.

Write a title for this article: A painting by Amedeo Modigliani fetched 170.4 million at an auction Monday, setting a world record for the artist and achieving the second highest price ever garnered for a work of art at auction. \\"Reclining Nude\\" was sold at Christie's in Manhattan after a protracted bidding battle to a buyer who wished to remain anonymous, according to the auction house. Considered one of his best known works, the 1917-1918 painting nearly created a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris. It depicts an unknown nude model reclining on a crimson couch and blue cushion. The previous auction record for a Modigliani was 71 million. Pablo Picasso's painting \\"Women of Algiers (Version O)\\" set the record for the highest sum ever paid for an artwork at auction. It sold for 179.4 million at Christie's in May. A Roy Lichtenstein painting not seen on the market for 20 years also set a world record for the artist. \\"Nurse\\" sold for 95.3 million, almost doubling the previous auction record for the pop artist of 56 million. Impressionist, modern and contemporary art by well-known artists \\"do not require a tremendous amount of aesthetic or intellectual risk on the part of the collector,\\" said Sarah Lichtman, assistant professor of design history at Parson School of Design. \\"They are beautiful paintings - some even exceptional as is the Modigliani - but they are tried and true.\\" Christie's expects to sell at least 1 billion of art over a series of evening, day and online sales this week. \\"There is clearly good appetite among collectors for exceptional works of art offered with appropriate estimates,\\" said Brook Hazelton, president of the Americas for Christie's. \\"This is a very broad and globally diverse market at the moment, with strong interest in paintings, sculpture and works on paper from the 10,000 level straight up to multimillion-dollar masterpieces at the top end.\\" Also on sale Monday night were two major works by Paul Gauguin from his Tahiti period. \\"Therese,\\" a carved wooden figure of a Tahitian female, brought in a record 30.9 million, topping its presale high estimate of 25 million. The previous auction record for a sculpture by the artist was 11.2 million. The other Gauguin, \\"Young Man with a Flower,\\" is a painting of a Tahitian youth wearing a white shirt, loose cravat and a white blossom tucked behind his ear. Christie's said it fetched 13.6 million, just above its low pre-sale estimate of 12 million. The portrait's first owner was Henri Matisse, who paid 200 francs for it in 1900. Later owners included John Quinn and Lillie Bliss, one of the original founders of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The current auction record for a Gauguin painting is 40.3 million. Among other highlights of \\"The Artist's Muse\\" sale is Pablo Picasso's \\"Man with a Sword,\\" a self-portrait of the artist as a musketeer created in 1969. It sold for 22.5 million. Christie's said interest in Picasso's late period musketeer portraits has grown dramatically in recent years. Also of interest were two works by Lucian Freud. \\"Naked Portrait on a Red Sofa\\" is a portrait of the artist's daughter, the fashion designer Bella Freud. Its pre-sale estimate was 20 million to 30 million, but it failed to sell Monday night. One of a series of portraits of his daughters, it is the first time it was offered at auction. On Tuesday, Christie's is offering Freud's \\"Brigadier,\\" a portrait of Andrew Parker Bowles, the former husband of Camilla Parker-Bowles, now the wife of Prince Charles. It was on view at the 2012 retrospective of the artist at the National Portrait Gallery in London and portrays the career soldier wearing his sumptuous army brigadier uniform. It's estimated to sell for around 30 million. Tuesday's post-war and contemporary art sale also has a mammoth bronze \\"Spider\\" sculpture by Louise Bourgeois, estimated at 25 million to 35 million. If realized, that price would exceed the artist's current auction record of 10.7 million and set a record for a sculpture by a female artist.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person Joseph arranged a contract for?  Janet Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records. Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph. It peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard 200,...

Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space. Although researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics   and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes. The sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years. The information of past climatic change can be used to predict the future climate. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about the Glomar Challenger? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It made its first DSDP voyage in 1969.\\"?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: My brother looks like Harry Styles and it's killing my wildest fantasies I’m in love with Harry Styles, the same man from One Direction who looks exactly like my brother. Awkward, much? That's an understatement. Last summer, when my family was visiting New York City from Ohio, we spent a particular evening at the theater. While we laughed our way through Bullets Over Broadway, I had no idea my world would be flipped upside down after leaving the show. As my siblings, parents, and cousins shuffled out onto West 44th Street, we were startled by a group of teenage girls, no older than 14, laughing and stuttering over the same two words: Harry Styles. This couldn’t be happening. He couldn’t be here. My heart began to race and I scrambled to come up with the perfect thing to say to Harry. Get a grip, Gabby, I thought. I was already an anomaly: a 22-year old woman whose demeanor and resume portrayed a mature adult but whose iTunes library mirrored most tweens. I cleared the foggy thoughts in my head, trying not to waste precious time that could be better spent laughing on the tour bus with him and the other 1D boys, an obvious end result to our impending encounter. In front of me, the gaggle of girls was crowding. Then I realized something: They were closing in around my little brother, Jori. Was this a joke? My friends had made off-hand comments that my 20-year-old brother resembled Harry, but these complete strangers didn't actually think he was the real deal, did they? My brother stood frozen as girls and young women requested photos and selfies. After confirming he indeed wasn’t the 21-year old pop star, the girls still didn’t flinch, confident their friends back home wouldn’t know the difference, anyway. I stood there, frozen, with an expression not unlike the emoji with a straight-line mouth and big, puzzled eyes. As the weeks passed by, my brother’s charm and flowing hair did nothing but assist in the delusion. How is a grown-ass woman supposed to live her life in One Direction bliss while her little brother gets mistaken for her boy-band heartthrob? It’s important to mention that I don’t see the resemblance and neither does he, which makes this whole thing more inconvenient. Still, I could be front row at every concert if I had a dollar for every time someone said to me, “It’s, like, weird, right? You love Harry Styles and your brother looks just like him?” Well, it wasn’t weird until you said that. If I get one more Snapchat from my college friends in response to a man-bun screenshot of my brother, I may very well explode. My whole family plays into the idea, too. They are constantly hashtagging #harrystyles on their pictures of him and calling him Harry when he’s in skinny jeans and a black tee. I get texts from him on the daily, describing his brushes with mistaken identity at school. During one instance, a car of girls actually followed him to class trying to figure out if it was Harold Edward himself, a situation that makes me question the logic and integrity of Northeast Ohio University students. To be honest, I’ve entertained the idea from time to time, captioning my own Instagrams of me and him with One Direction wit, sending my friends videos of my brother belting out a verse of “You and I,” and joining in on the banter around the dinner table during my trips home. But it has never felt organic. I refuse to believe my baby brother looks like the young man who sang me through late night study sessions for four years in college. My baby bro of 20 years does not resemble the British babe that dated Taylor Swift. He can’t, I tell myself again and again. A year after the incident outside the theater, my affection for One Direction remains. I still have a ticket to sit on the floor at their concert in August, and my brother still yells at me when I play the now four-member band (ughhh, Zayn!) in the car for too long. When it comes to my brother’s supposed likeness, I’m not in denial. In fact, I think this whole thing has made me love 1D even more, as I’ve searched for additional reasons that contradict people’s claims. For starters, my brother can’t carry a tune in a basket, and that’s a big enough difference for me. He also doesn’t have any majestic tattoos that make him more irresistible than any boy I’ve ever met in my waking life. It does make me a little worried, though. As my brother’s luscious locks get longer every passing day, the texts and teases from friends have been increasing at an exponential rate. Harry Styles' doppleganger or not, I can assure you of one thing: My brother will not be joining me for any trips out east this summer. I don’t think I can handle another run-in with Southampton’s finest (i.e. its bronzed 55-year old women) stopping at our lunch table for an autograph and a picture because “their granddaughters will be so jealous.” Can’t I eat my kale and beet salad without someone trying to get TMZ all up in my face? At least wait until I’ve finished my mimosa — though, there won't be too many. Because maybe — just maybe — I will then start seeing him as Harry, too. Now that would be awkward.

Summary:","output":"In the news article, the author explains that his younger brother is often mistaken for Harry Styles from One Direction due to their similar appearance. This has come as quite a shock for the author, who is a huge fan of the band. The mistaken identity began with a group of teenage girls approaching his brother in New York City, thinking he was Harry Styles. From there, it has continued with friends, family, and strangers commenting on the resemblance and teasing the author about their love for the band. Despite the frequent comparisons, the author asserts that they do not see the resemblance between his brother and the pop star.

The answer is:","output":"Pimpinella and Digitalis are both genera of flowering plants that share some common characteristics. However, they belong to two different families within the plant kingdom - Pimpinella is a member of the Apiaceae (carrot or parsley family), while Digitalis is a part of the Plantaginaceae (plantain family). Despite their differences, there are some similarities between them, such as: 1. Medicinal properties: Both Pimpinella and Digitalis plants have been used traditionally for their medicinal benefits. Pimpinella species, such as Pimpinella anisum (anise), have been used to treat digestive disorders, coughs, and other respiratory issues due to their carminative, antispasmodic, and expectorant properties. On the other hand, Digitalis species like Digitalis purpurea (foxglove) are well-known for their cardiovascular applications, specifically for treating heart-related conditions like congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. The active compounds in foxglove, called cardenolides, directly impact the heart muscle, improving its efficiency. 2. Flower structure: Though not identical, both Pimpinella and Digitalis plants possess unique inflorescences - their flowers are arranged in a specific pattern on their stems. Pimpinella species typically have umbel-shaped inflorescences, whereas Digitalis species display racemes or spikes of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. 3. Biennial or perennial growth habit: Both Pimpinella and Digitalis plants could be biennial or perennial, meaning that they either have a two-year life cycle or that they live for multiple years and produce flowers in successive seasons. 4. Pollinator attraction: Just like many other flowering plants, Pimpinella and Digitalis have developed features that help attract pollinators. Pimpinella flowers usually have a sweet fragrance that entices insects, while the brightly colored, tubular flowers of Digitalis are attractive to pollinators such as bees, bumblebees, and hummingbirds, facilitating the spread of their pollen. In conclusion, Pimpinella and Digitalis share some common characteristics such as medicinal properties, unique flower structures, biennial or perennial growth habits, and pollinator attraction strategies. However, it's essential to remember that they belong to different families and have distinct features and applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

CHAPTER XXVIII  SPENNIE'S HOUR OF CLEAR VISION  Mr. McEachern sat in the billiard-room, smoking. He was alone. From where he sat, he could hear distant strains of music. The more rigorous portion of the evening's entertainment, the theatricals, was over, and the nobility and gentry, having done their duty by sitting through the performance, were now enjoying themselves in the ballroom. Everybody was happy. The play had been quite as successful as the usual amateur performance. The prompter had made himself a great favorite from the start, his series of duets with Spennie having been especially admired; and Jimmy, as became an old professional, had played his part with great finish and certainty of touch, though, like the bloodhounds in \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" on the road, he had had poor support. But the audience bore no malice. No collection of individuals is less vindictive than an audience at amateur theatricals. It was all over now. Charteris had literally gibbered in the presence of eye-witnesses at one point in the second act, when Spennie, by giving a wrong cue, had jerked the play abruptly into act three, where his colleagues, dimly suspecting something wrong, but not knowing what it was, had kept it for two minutes, to the mystification of the audience. But, now Charteris had begun to forget. As he two-stepped down the room, the lines of agony on his face were softened. He even smiled.  As for Spennie, the brilliance of his happy grin dazzled all beholders.  He was still wearing it when he invaded the solitude of Mr. McEachern. In every dance, however greatly he may be enjoying it, there comes a time when a man needs a meditative cigarette apart from the throng. It came to Spennie after the seventh item on the program. The billiard-room struck him as admirably suitable in every way. It was not likely to be used as a sitting-out place, and it was near enough to the ball-room to enable him to hear when the music of item number nine should begin.

This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.  and the situation: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.  Answer the following question: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","output":"The black coat will absorb more sunlight.  This is because of the way light and color interact with each other. Every color we perceive is a result of light either being absorbed by an object or being reflected or transmitted to our eyes. When light strikes an object, the object absorbs some of the light and reflects or transmits the rest of it. The color that we perceive an object to be is the color of light that is reflected or transmitted to our eyes.  In the case of a black object, all or most of the light is absorbed and very little, if any, is reflected or transmitted to our eyes. This is why we perceive the object as black. Therefore, a black object, or in this case the black coat, will absorb the most sunlight energy.  On the contrary, a white object reflects or transmits all or most of the light that strikes it and absorbs very little, if any. That's why we perceive the object as white. Thus, a large white coat will absorb less sunlight than a large black coat.  In terms of warmth, since black absorbs more light and with it more heat, the black coat would be theoretically warmer as it would absorb sunlight and convert it into heat. However, it is important to note that while the color of the coat can have an effect on its temperature, the material of the coat and the amount of insulation it provides will also play crucial roles in determining how warm the coat will be. The manner in which the coat is worn - if it is zipped up or left open, for example - will also impact its warmth.  Therefore, even though in theory the black coat would be the one to absorb more sunlight, how much warmer it will actually keep Johnathan will depend on many factors including the architecture of the coat as well as the circumstances in which he will be wearing it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lizzy: A sweet and practical young woman who has a love for beautiful artwork and design. She appreciates quality but is also budget-conscious due to her frugal nature. --- (Scene: David and Lizzy are in their living room, standing next to a rolled-up poster that Lizzy received as a gift from David's sister.) David: (admiring the poster) You know, we really need to get a frame for this beautiful poster that my sister got you. Lizzy: Absolutely, it's such a thoughtful gift and I can't wait to see it hanging on our wall. Where do you think we should look for a frame? David: Well, we could either go to a local framing shop for something custom-made, or we can try our luck at discount stores for more affordable options. Lizzy: As much as I'd love a custom frame, I'm not sure we can afford that right now. Let's try our luck with the discount stores first. (Scene: David and Lizzy are browsing through various frames at a discount store; they're discussing the options they come across) David: (holding up a simple black frame) What do you think of this one? It's minimalistic and won't distract from the poster's design. Lizzy: It does look nice, but do you think the material is sturdy enough to last? I don't want it to break or wear out quickly. David: Good point. (checks the material) It seems okay, but it might not be the best quality. (spots another frame) How about this wooden one? It's more expensive, but I bet it would last much longer. Lizzy: (examining the wooden frame) I like that it has some texture to it, and it feels sturdier. But I worry it might be too ornate for the poster and take away from the image. David: You're right; the design might clash. Well, let's keep looking then. (Scene: David and Lizzy find a store employee to ask for suggestions.) Lizzy: Excuse me, can you help us find a frame for this poster? We're looking for something sturdy and not too expensive. Employee: Sure, let me show you our selection of metal frames. They're quite durable and reasonably priced. (Scene: The employee guides them to the metal frames section, and they browse the options.) David: (picking up a silver metal frame) This one seems like a good choice. It's lightweight and has a modern look. Do you think it would work? Lizzy: Actually, I really like that one! It's still simple, but it has a nice touch of sophistication. Plus, it feels much sturdier than the other options we've seen. David: Great, then let's go with this one. (Scene: David and Lizzy purchase the frame and bring it home.) David: (assembling the frame) It fits the poster perfectly! This was definitely the right choice. Lizzy: Agreed, I can't wait to see it hanging on the wall. Thank you, David, for helping me find the perfect frame for this precious gift from your sister. David: No problem, Lizzy! It was a pleasure to make sure her gift to you finds the perfect place in our home.

Samples were taken from Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and from the bloodstained uniform of Alexander II, Nicholas's grandfather, killed in 1881.      The Romanov family members, who were killed by revolutionary Bolsheviks, are buried at a St Petersburg cathedral.      The Orthodox Church wants to confirm family links before other relatives can be reburied with them.      The long-running murder case had been closed in 1998, after DNA tests authenticated the Romanov remains found in a mass grave in the Urals in 1991.      But the DNA tests did not convince some Russian Orthodox Church members, because the remains of two - Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria - were found only in 2007, at a different spot in the Urals.      The Investigative Committee, a state body, says new checks are needed in order to authenticate the remains of those two.      Russia plans to rebury Alexei and Maria alongside the rest of the family in St Petersburg's Peter and Paul Cathedral. But for that to happen the Church wants to be certain about the remains.      Image caption The four Romanov princesses with their brother Alexei      Hail of bullets      Tsar Nicholas II, Alexandra, their four daughters - grand duchesses Anastasia, Maria, Olga and Tatiana - their son the Tsarevich Alexei and four royal staff members were murdered in the cellar of a house in Yekaterinburg in 1918.      One night they were lined up as if for a family photo, and then a Bolshevik firing squad killed them in a hail of bullets, according to witness accounts. Those who did not die immediately were bayonetted.      The royal couple and three daughters were formally reburied on 17 July 1998 - the 80th anniversary of the murder. They were canonised by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.      Alexei and Maria are also likely to be canonised before the 100th anniversary in 2018. Their remains are currently kept at the Russian State Archives.      The new investigation also involves taking samples from Alexandra's sister the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, buried in Jerusalem. Only now can Russian investigators get access to those remains.

Tsar Alexander II was killed by a bomb thrown by a \\"People's Will\\" revolutionary in 1881, and buried in his military uniform in the Peter and Paul Cathedral.      A lawyer for Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, a descendant of the murdered Romanovs, said she supported the new investigation.      Quoted by Russia's Tass news agency, lawyer German Lukyanov said \\"not all aspects of the imperial family's murder were explained in the case, and not all the Russian Orthodox Church's questions were answered fully and clearly\\".      \\"The grand duchess hopes that the examination of the Yekaterinburg remains will be scientific...

Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs are also known to have even settled on Norse age Iceland. Saqaliba refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus. Saqaliba served as caliph's guards. In the 12th century, there was intensification of Slavic piracy in the Baltics. The Wendish Crusade was started against the Polabian Slavs in 1147, as a part of the Northern Crusades. Niklot, pagan chief of the Slavic Obodrites, began his open resistance when Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor, invaded Slavic lands. In August 1160 Niklot was killed and German colonization (Ostsiedlung) of the Elbe-Oder region began. In Hanoverian Wendland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Lusatia invaders started germanization. Early forms of germanization were described by German monks: Helmold in the manuscript Chronicon Slavorum and Adam of Bremen in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in what is now the German state of Lower Saxony. In Eastern Germany, around 20% of Germans have Slavic paternal ancestry.

However, I can provide an analysis of possible responses Lee may have when faced with the consequences of their poor job performance. Please note that these responses are not from the options you provided, as those seem to suggest actions that you or someone else might take. 1. Reflect on their performance: Lee may take a step back and evaluate their work to identify where they went wrong. They might analyze their work processes, communication skills, or technical skills to determine the cause of their underperformance. This reflection can be crucial for personal and professional growth, as it may help Lee recognize their shortcomings and work towards improvement. 2. Seek feedback and mentorship: Acknowledging one's limitations and seeking assistance to improve can be a healthy and productive response. Lee may want to approach their supervisors, colleagues, or mentors for constructive feedback regarding their work and guidance on improving their performance. This approach can help Lee learn from their mistakes and avoid a repeat of poor performance in the future. 3. Improve skills and knowledge: After identifying the areas where they need improvement, Lee may want to invest in professional development opportunities, such as workshops, seminars, or online courses, to enhance their skills and knowledge. Improving their expertise and staying updated with industry trends can significantly contribute to better work outcomes and prevent underperformance. 4. Adjust their work approach: Sometimes, the issue may not lie in technical skills or knowledge but in one's work approach. Lee might consider changing their work strategies, time management practices, or project management techniques. This change can lead to more efficient work processes and ultimately improve their job performance. 5. Communicate with employers or clients: Lee might wish to proactively communicate their shortcomings and improvement plans to their employers or clients to establish trust and transparency. By taking responsibility for their actions and demonstrating a commitment to improvement, Lee may be able to rebuild their professional reputation and regain the confidence of their employers or clients. 6. Consider a different career path: If Lee's poor performance persists despite their efforts to improve, they may want to explore alternative career paths where their skills and strengths better align with the job requirements. Sometimes, a change in career direction can reveal new opportunities and lead to success and job satisfaction. In conclusion, although it's impossible to predict Lee's precise reaction, these potential responses emphasize self-improvement, reflection, and proactive communication, which are essential elements for paving the way to success and growth in any professional environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - bathroom - house - cupboard - space shuttle - surface of earth  The rationale to choose \\"cupboard\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The correct answer is \\"cupboard\\" and the rationale behind choosing it as the answer is as follows: 1. Relevance to the kitchen: The cupboard is a common fixture in kitchens, primarily used for storing food items, kitchenware, and other supplies. Hence, it is more likely that the stale smell is originating from an item stored within the cupboard as compared to the other options. 2. Potential causes of a stale smell: The smell could be caused by expired or rotting food items inside the cupboard, moist or damp conditions promoting mold growth, poor ventilation, or spills that haven't been properly cleaned. Since cupboards often contain various perishable items, they are a more likely source of stale odors in comparison to the alternatives provided. 3.

Next question: distribution of power between centre and state in indian constitution is based on which scheme?","output":"The distribution of power between the center and the state in the Indian Constitution is based on the federal scheme that efficiently adopts various features of multiple federal structures. The Indian federal system draws its inspiration primarily from British, Canadian, and Australian models. The Constitution of India incorporates three lists in its Seventh Schedule: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. These lists define the division of powers and responsibilities shared between the center and the state governments. This clear demarcation of powers provides the fundamental framework that upholds the autonomy of states while preserving the essence of a federal structure. 1. Union List: The Union List comprises subjects on which only the central government (also known as the union government) can make laws or take decisions. Some of these subjects include defense, atomic energy, foreign affairs, railways, air transport, naval ports, and communication. Since these matters are of national importance and require uniform policies, it is imperative for the central government to maintain control over them without state interference. 2. State List: The State List contains subjects that fall under the authority of the respective state governments. These subjects include public health, agriculture, land, police, local government, weights and measures, and gambling. The center plays no direct role in the legislation over these subjects. However, in cases of emergencies like national security or a breakdown of constitutional machinery within a state, the central government can intervene and enact legislation under the President's Rule. 3. Concurrent List: The Concurrent List includes subjects that allow the central and state governments to make laws together. Some of these subjects are criminal law, bankruptcy, marriage and divorce, bankruptcy and insolvency, price control, and trusts. In the case of a conflict between the central and state laws over a subject in the Concurrent List, the central law prevails. The Indian Constitution also provides provisions for the division of financial resources between the center and the states. Article 268 to 281 of the Indian Constitution governs the distribution of revenue and taxes between the two levels of government. In addition to these provisions, the Finance Commission is established every five years to advise the President on the distribution of taxes between the center and states, thereby ensuring a fair degree of financial autonomy to the state governments. Moreover, the Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power between the center and state governments. It acts as the guardian of the Constitution and settles disputes that arise on the interpretation of the Constitution or federal laws. The Court ensures that the powers are wielded within the limits prescribed by the Constitution. In conclusion, the distribution of power between the center and state in the Indian Constitution is based on a federal scheme that borrows features from multiple federal structures. A combination of the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists, financial provisions, the mechanism of Finance Commission, and the role of the Supreme Court facilitates an equilibrium of power and responsibilities between both levels of government while preserving the unity and diversity of the Indian nation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. The frequent absences of King George I from England and Parliament led directly to the creation of which position in government?","output":"The frequent absences of King George I from England and Parliament led directly to the creation of the position of Prime Minister in the British government. This development was not a planned or formal action but rather an organic change in the government's structure that eventually solidified as a key position in the British political system over time. King George I ascended to the British throne in 1714 and spent a considerable amount of time in his native Hanover. His absence from England and limited command of the English language made it difficult for him to govern effectively and engage directly with the Parliament. Therefore, he began to rely increasingly on his key ministers to handle the affairs of state in his absence. One particular minister, Sir Robert Walpole, emerged as a capable and influential figure during these years. He held various official titles, such as First Commissioner of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons. As King George I's chief minister from 1721 to 1742, Walpole is widely regarded as the first Prime Minister in British history, even though the title \\"Prime Minister\\" did not formally exist at the time. Walpole's influence and authority stemmed from the trust and confidence that the King had placed in him. In King George I's absence, Walpole assumed responsibility for coordinating the work of the other ministers, managing the parliamentary majority, and acting as the King's chief advisor on policy matters. Consequently, this increasingly centralized administration allowed Walpole to exert considerable power over the government. The rise of Sir Robert Walpole set a precedent for subsequent prime ministers who emerged as the central figures in British politics. The role of Prime Minister in the British government became more defined and formalized over the years, with regular duties, responsibilities, and authorities attached to it. Today, the Prime Minister is the head of the British government, overseeing the executive branch, coordinating the Cabinet, representing the government in Parliament, and acting as the principal spokesperson for the government both within the UK and internationally. Thus, the frequent absences of King George I from England and Parliament facilitated the emergence of the Prime Minister as a crucial position in the British government. Through the need for a strong, centralized leadership figure to manage the affairs of state, the role of Prime Minister ultimately developed into one of the most powerful and influential positions within the political system of the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a science question (easy-level) and four answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

U.S. Forest Service blames targets for 16 wildfires. Maryland regulates the targets; predicts other states will follow. Article:","output":"Title: Exploding Targets: A Growing Danger That Can't Be Ignored In recent times, the alarming proliferation of videos showcasing \\"exploding targets\\" has raised concerns among federal agencies, lawmakers, and public safety experts. As these products gain popularity, many are calling for stricter regulations to curb their potentially disastrous impacts on the environment and human safety.  Exploding targets, also known as binary exploding targets, are a type of shot indicator widely-used in recreational shooting sessions. They consist of two separate compounds that, when mixed and hit by a projectile such as a bullet, produce a powerful explosion accompanied by a loud bang and a burst of smoke. Sold under various brand names, these targets often imply an added excitement factor for firearm enthusiasts. The problem, however, lies in the neglectful manner in which these targets are being used, as evidenced by the numerous videos on platforms like YouTube. Users in the videos are often seen blatantly disregarding safety guidelines provided by the manufacturers, leading to dangerous consequences. This behavior has also resulted in an increase in the number of wildfires in recent years - a fact highlighted by the U.S. Forest Service, which has attributed 16 wildfires to the misuse of exploding targets. Recognizing the potential hazards of these targets, the state of Maryland has taken the first steps towards regulating their use. The move has been seen as a precursor to other states following suit, given the growing awareness surrounding the issues associated with exploding targets. With a stronger regulatory framework in place, it is hoped that the misuse of such products would be mitigated substantially, thereby minimizing the risks to both people and the environment. In addition to the regulations enacted by individual states, further actions like public awareness campaigns, stronger manufacturer guidelines, and educational initiatives should be employed to tackle this issue comprehensively. Bringing together various stakeholders, including federal and state agencies, manufacturers, and firearm users, would create a more effective response to the dangers posed by exploding targets. The misuse of exploding targets demands attention, not just from those who enjoy recreational shooting, but also from the broader public. The potential risks of using these products irresponsibly are too grave to ignore. As the Maryland case has shown, regulatory measures can be a positive step in controlling the hazards associated with these targets. However, it is crucial that other states join the movement to create a robust regulatory environment that ensures the safety of both people and the environment. In conclusion, the rising popularity of exploding targets has brought with it a host of dangers that urgently need to be addressed by regulators, manufacturers, and users alike. While the onus is on individuals to follow safety guidelines, governments must also put in place comprehensive measures to control the risks associated with these devices fully. By working together, it is possible to strike a balance between the enjoyment of recreational shooting and preserving the safety of our communities and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Rogers Clark Ballard Morton (September 19, 1914 - April 19, 1979) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce during the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, Jr., respectively. He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. Though he was born in Louisville, Kentucky, Morton moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives, in which capacity he established an environmental record. Context: In 1947, Morton spent a great deal of time helping his brother Thruston in his ultimately successful campaign for election to the House of Representatives in Kentucky. After this initial exposure to politics, Morton moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s, where he set up a 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) cattle farm along the Wye River in Talbot County. In 1962, Morton decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Thomas Francis Johnson of Maryland's 1st congressional district. Johnson, who was reeling from a political scandal, lost to Morton in the general election. Morton was lauded for not making Johnson's legal troubles his primary campaign issue.  Morton was re-elected to Congress four more times, and served from 1963 until 1971. In Congress, Morton worked to enact legislation that would preserve the Chesapeake Bay, including laws reducing pollution into the Bay, working for the creation of a national park on Assateague Island, and providing funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to model how the Bay functions as an estuary. Concerning civil rights, Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but not the Act of 1968.  During the 1968 Republican National Convention, Morton served as the floor manager for eventual presidential nominee Richard Nixon. Morton also delivered the speech nominating Spiro Agnew, then-Governor of Maryland, as the vice presidential candidate.  Due to his role in Nixon's election campaign and his environmental advocacy, Morton expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969. However, he was passed over for the position in favor of a westerner. He had also been considered for Nixon's vice presidential running mate, but lost out to Agnew. In January 1969, to recognize his efforts, Nixon appointed Morton as chairman of the Republican National Committee. As chairman, Morton was granted ex officio Cabinet rank by Nixon, an unprecedented practice that ultimately continued through the administration of Gerald Ford. Question: When was he elected to congress?. Whats the answer?","output":"Rogers Clark Ballard Morton was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1962. He decided to challenge the incumbent Democratic representative, Thomas Francis Johnson, for the 1st congressional district of Maryland. Johnson was dealing with a political scandal at the time, which likely influenced the outcome of the election in favor of Morton. Despite the scandal, Morton was commended for not making Johnson's legal troubles a primary focus of his campaign. This successful election marked the beginning of Morton's congressional career. After this initial win, Morton was re-elected to Congress four more times, serving in this capacity from 1963 until 1971.   During his time in Congress, Morton was heavily involved in environmental conservation legislation. He worked on measures designed to preserve the Chesapeake Bay, including laws aimed at reducing pollution levels in the bay. As part of this environmental work, Morton helped to establish a national park on Assateague Island and secured funds for the Army Corps of Engineers to research how the bay functions as an estuary. This strong record in environmental advocacy was one of the reasons Morton had expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969 after Richard Nixon's election to the presidency. However, he was passed over for this position in favor of a candidate from the western United States.   Morton's political influence extended beyond his own congressional representation and environmental advocacy. He also played a key role in the 1968 Republican National Convention, during which he served as the floor manager for Nixon's successful presidential campaign. Morton also delivered the nomination speech for Spiro Agnew, who was then serving as the Governor of Maryland, as the vice presidential candidate. After Nixon's election, Morton was appointed as chairman of the Republican National Committee in January 1969.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

Redfish is a beer-drinking, bar-brawling, fun-loving distributor of Shiner beer. He also helps his father, Corpus C. Redfish with the family salvage company, whose motto is \\"Everything will work if you let it!\\" B.B. Muldoon is his best friend and business partner. While B.B. and Travis are making deliveries in their Shiner beer truck, they notice an RV that has broken down on the side of the road. At first, they laugh at the thought of helping the stranded motorists, but then Travis sees wannabee groupie Lola Bouliabaise smile at him through the rear window of the RV. Travis slams on the brakes and decides to help, hoping to get a closer look at Lola. Lola is a big Alice Cooper fan and Travis has never heard of \\"her\\". Road manager Ace and his assistant George try to talk Travis into driving them to Austin for a show to be played by Hank Williams Jr., produced by music mogul Mohammed Johnson. He meets Bird Lockhart, a hippie and lifelong roadie in the music business. After repairing the RV, Lola talks Travis into coming along where he ends up becoming the \\"greatest roadie that ever lived\\" with his unusual techniques on fixing things. On the road, Travis gets into a bar fight with \\"Tiny\\" Thompson after Lola accidentally ruins his little sister's hair by dumping beer on it in an attempt to meet Roy Orbison. After head butting Tiny, Travis ends up with \\"Brain-Lock\\",  a condition he developed in the war, for which chugging a pitcher of beer is the only cure. Lola convinces him to drive them to Hollywood for another show. He drives like a maniac and ends up with B.B in hot pursuit and the police right behind them all. Soon Travis passes out and wakes up the next day in the back of a trailer carrying musical equipment. He yells at Lola for promising everybody that he'll stay on as a roadie, then relents when he brings her to tears. Lola then turns around with a smile and suggests they use the limo to go to the hotel.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who meets Bird Lockhart? The answer is:","output":"The first name of the person who meets Bird Lockhart in the given context is Travis.  To elaborate further -  Travis W. Redfish is the central character in the story. He is a beer distributor who loves having a good time and also assists his father, Corpus C. Redfish, with their family salvage company. While making a beer delivery with his best friend and business partner, B.B. Muldoon, they come across a broken-down RV. In this RV is Lola Bouliabaise, whom Travis takes an interest in upon seeing her smile. Lola, a groupie and a significant Alice Cooper fan, ends up becoming the reason Travis would meet Bird Lockhart. With the promise of getting to know Lola better, Travis helps repair the RV and agrees to accompany the group, thereby leading him on a wild and somewhat unexpected adventure within the music world. During this journey, Travis meets a variety of interesting, if not peculiar, individuals. One of these is Bird Lockhart, a hippie and a lifelong roadie in the music business. It becomes evident that while Travis had initially known very little about Alice Cooper and was purely interested in Lola, he eventually takes on the significant role of keeping things going smoothly within the group by using his unique problem-solving techniques, leading him to be coined \\"the greatest roadie that ever lived.\\" By choosing to go along for the ride, Travis not only became indispensable to the group, but he also came to have experiences he might not have had otherwise – including, of course, meeting Bird Lockhart. For all these reasons, it is safe to conclude that the first name of the person who meets Bird Lockhart in this context is indeed, Travis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Dutch artist Bart Jansen has found an unusual way to pay his last respects to his pet cat Orville, who died after being hit by a car. He turned the feline into a helicopter, or a quadrocopter to be precise, with four rotors, each fitted to one outstretched paw. Now the dead tabby is flying around with a startled look on his face, provoking amusement and shock in equal measure.      \\"The Orvillecopter, half cat, half machine,\\" Jansen wrote on his website. \\"Named after the famous aviator Orville Wright. He was killed by a car. After a period of mourning he received his propellers posthumously.\\"      Jansen adds, rather defensively: \\"For the cat lovers: it's a tanned hide, just like the shoes you're wearing.\\"      Jansen got help from model airplane pilot Arjen Beltman to mount the rotor blades in a way that ensures maximum flight stability on what surely must be the world's first feline helicopter. A plastic undercarriage allows dignified landings.      A video on Jansen's website shows Orville's first, rather unsteady test flight in March, during which he hovered a few inches from the ground to the sound of cheers and laughter from an unseen crown of onlookers. Since then, his flying has improved and he travels at considerable speed, emitting a loud buzz and steering with a fin attached to his tail.      \\"Soon to be flying with the birds. Oh, how he loved the birds,\\" wrote Jansen, whose art project has become a Youtube hit.      The reaction has been predictably mixed, though. One viewer called JoergDD2DX commented: \\"Bart, you're just perverted, but no artist!\\" Hamdan370 writes: \\"This is sick. Lay the poor cat to rest.\\" But Devilchris86 writes: \\"HAHAHA, I can't stop laughing! That's hilarious!\\"      Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals told msnbc.com: \\"It's a macabre way to honor a beloved family member.\\"      Orville is currently being exhibited at an Amsterdam gallery as part of the KunstRAI art festival. Jansen plans to fit more powerful motors to his paws at a later stage.      Jansen's other works include the \\"Ku Klux Klock,\\" which has a little hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan that pops out on the hour instead of a cuckoo bird. ||||| We've seen a lot of strange things on the Internet, but this dead cat turned into a remote-control flying helicopter may be the strangest yet.      The cat helicopter was conceived by Dutch artist Bart Jansen, and debuted for the public at the KunstRai ArtFair in Amsterdam that ended Sunday. Jansen calls his creation the Orvillecopter and describes it as \\"half-cat, half-machine.\\"      The Orvillecopter is exactly what it looks like: A taxidermied cat with a plastic propeller attached to each paw. No animals were harmed for this project. The cat, who was conveniently named Orville, belonged to Jansen and died after he was hit by a car.      \\"After that he received his wings posthumously,\\" the artist writes in a description of a YouTube video showing the Orvillecopter's first flight.      The artist says he did observe a period of mourning before turning his dead cat into a flying machine, but he clearly thinks he's done Orville a favor by giving him flight after death.      \\"Now he is flying with the birds,\\" he writes. \\"The greatest goal a cat could ever reach!\\"      According to an artist's statement, Jansen's work is mostly about what happens when the race for technological progress meets human error.      \\"When Bart creates installations, they are mostly inventions, new machines, devices that fufill meaningless functions,\\" the statement reads. \\"One condition goes: They must work.\\"      It did take Jansen a while to get his Orvillecopter to work, as a series of YouTube videos shows. But after a few engine updates and a new speed controller, the Orvillecopter was in good flying form, as you can see from the video below.

After a few initial test flights, videos of the Orvillecopter went viral on YouTube, drawing mixed reactions from viewers.

Review: She's not Michael Jordan Think of all the marvelous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. Their names might trip as easily off the public's lips as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a little, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael. I've seen it written that Gretchen Mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been over hyped. I disagree. I still remember that for some time after I saw \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" in '97 or '98, I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in \\"2 Days in the Valley\\" and \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" and Gretchen Mol was in \\"Donnie Brasco\\", \\"Celebrity\\", and \\"Rounders\\". By the time I had seen \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\" (Mol) and \\"Sweet November\\" (Theron), I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on. Theron, though, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating. In 2003 \\"Monster\\" was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself, all of filmdom knew who the \\"Best Actress\\" award was going to. And deservedly so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby's head. And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! Unheard of! Then in 2005 \\"The Notorious Bettie Page\\" was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing Presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale, once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a \\"B\\" movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you may think of the film (and I enjoy films about the fifties) if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year. Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately Aileen, to the film-going public, is the more sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a naïve, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and films never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film, her body was Bettie's. Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie. Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality. In this film it's all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen/Bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating. Now, what is this review like? Pick from:  1). negative.  2). positive.","output":"This review is 2). Positive.  The review glowingly assesses the performances of actresses Gretchen Mol and Charlize Theron.

There is special praise towards the end of the review for Gretchen Mol's performance in \\"The Notorious Bettie Page\\", outlining in detail their appreciation for her portrayal of Bettie's persona. Even though the reviewer lightly criticizes the film industry and MPAA, the overall sentiment is positive and full of admiration for the performances of these actresses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?  Hint: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot determine the exact duration of Era A and Era B. However, we can deduce the likelihood of which era would be relatively shorter. Era A refers to the time when dinosaurs were flourishing before the mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago. This period includes the entire reign of dinosaurs, which lasted for approximately 165 million years, during the Mesozoic Era. This era encompasses the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, during which time new species of dinosaurs evolved, while others became extinct due to various factors such as environmental changes, competition for resources, and genetic mutations. Era B, on the other hand, represents the time period of the mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago. This event led to the extinction of around 75% of all species present on Earth, including non-avian dinosaurs. Mass extinction events, as mentioned in the hint, often involve an accumulation of smaller extinction events that take place in a relatively short period of time. Throughout Earth's history, there have been five major mass extinction events, each causing a devastating loss of biodiversity. Considering the definition of each era, it is more likely that Era B would be relatively shorter compared to Era A. The reasoning behind this can be explained by examining their respective characteristics. Era A encompasses a longer period, during which dinosaurs were evolving and thriving. This time frame allows for a considerable amount of change and development within the ecosystem. In contrast, Era B signifies a mass extinction event that resulted in a rapid and significant loss of biodiversity. While it is challenging to estimate the exact duration of this extinction event, it is generally accepted that mass extinctions happen within a shorter time span compared to the lengthy evolutionary processes that take place in periods like Era A. Therefore, given the nature of mass extinction events and their relatively brief impact on Earth's history, it is likely that Era B would be shorter than Era A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to give you a detailed response, I would like to break down the topic into several aspects such as location, property type, and important factors to consider while renting a residential home in a suburban area. 1. Location: When searching for a residential home in a suburb, the location is one of the most significant factors to consider. You will want to choose a suburb that offers a comfortable commute to work or school, easy access to public transportation, and proximity to amenities such as grocery stores, restaurants, and parks. Additionally, you should research the safety and crime rates, as well as the school districts in the area if you have children. 2. Property Type: As your budget is 2,200 US dollars per month, you may have a few options regarding the type of residential home you can rent. Houses, townhouses, and apartments can all be found in suburban areas. Your choice of property type will largely depend on your personal preferences, needs, and the size of your family. Do you need a backyard or extra storage? Will you be living alone or with roommates or family members? These factors can help you determine the best property type for your situation. 3. Viewing and Inspecting Properties: Once you have shortlisted potential properties, it is advisable to schedule property viewings. This will allow you to inspect the condition of the property, get a feel for the neighborhood, and ask any necessary questions. Key aspects to consider when viewing a property include the overall layout, cleanliness, and maintenance, as well as the availability of parking and any included appliances. 4. Lease Agreements and Negotiations: After selecting a suitable property, you should review the lease agreement carefully. This document will outline the terms and conditions of your rental, such as the duration of the lease, monthly rent, security deposit, and rules relating to pets or alterations to the property. If you find any unfavorable clauses in the lease, consider discussing your concerns with the landlord and potentially negotiating terms that suit both parties. 5. Preparing for the Move: Once you have signed the lease agreement, start preparing for the move to your new suburban home. Inform your current utility providers, and set up new accounts if necessary. Additionally, be sure to update your mailing address and notify friends, family, and important institutions such as banks and insurance companies. In conclusion, when searching for a residential home in a suburb with a budget of 2,200 US dollars per month, it is important to focus on the location, property type, viewing and inspecting properties, lease agreements, and preparing for the move. By paying close attention to these factors, you can successfully find a rental home that meets your needs and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There was once a lonely girl who longed so much for love. One day while she was walking in the woods she found two starving songbirds. She took them home and put them in a small cage, caring them with love. Luckily, the birds grew strong little by little. Every morning they greeted her with a wonderful song. The girl felt great love for the birds. One day the girl left the door to the cage open accidentally. The larger and stronger of the two         birds flew from the cage. The girl was so frightened that he would fly away. So as he flew close, she grasped him wildly. Her heart felt glad at her success in capturing him. Suddenly, she felt the bird go weak, so she opened her hand and stared in horror at the dead bird. It was her desperate love that had killed him. She noticed the other bird moving back and forth on the edge of the cage. She could feel his strong desire--needing to fly into the clear, blue sky. Unwillingly, she lifted him from the cage and threw him softly into the air. The lucky bird circled once, twice, three times. The girl watched delightedly at the bird. Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss. What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder. It sang the sweetest tune that she had ever heard. Remember, the fastest way to lose love is to hold on it too tight; the best way to keep love is to give it wings! Options: A Catch what you can catch on your way to success. B Going too far is as bad as not going far enough. C East or west, home is best. D A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Answer: B Going too far is as bad as not going far enough. Question: Answer:","output":"Based on the story of the lonely girl and the two birds, which of the following proverbs best captures the moral of the story? A) \\"Catch what you can catch on your way to success.\\"  B) \\"Going too far is as bad as not going far enough.\\"  C) \\"East or west, home is best.\\"  D) \\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\\" This story is about the lonely girl who took in two starving birds and cared for them. However, her excessive love leads to the death of one bird when she tries to prevent it from leaving. The girl then realizes the value of letting go and affords the second bird its freedom, which results in it confidently flying in the sky and, surprisingly, returning to perch on her shoulder. The story elucidates that, sometimes, love requires you to let go and not hold on too tightly. It demonstrates the proverb, \\"Going too far is as bad as not going far enough,\\" meaning extreme behavior, including overwhelming love or attention, can be as destructive as its lack. So the correct answer is B) \\"Going too far is as bad as not going far enough.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: didn't work with my seat Review: kept falling off my seat (orbit). also my 4mo old didn't deem interested in it at all. He loves his whozit spiral! Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of the product review provided is negative. Several factors contribute to this overall negative tone, which can be analyzed through both the content and the choice of words in the review. 1. Frustration with product compatibility: The first line of the review, \\"kept falling off my seat (orbit)\\", demonstrates the frustration experienced by the reviewer as the product did not work with their specific seat model. This might make potential buyers cautious about the product's functionality, especially those with the same seat model or similar ones. 2. Lack of interest from the child: In the review, the author states, \\"also my 4mo old didn't seem interested in it at all.\\" This indicates that the product was not engaging for their child, which speaks negatively about the product's capacity to entertain or fulfill its intended purpose as a baby accessory. 3. Comparison to another product: The reviewer further compares the product unfavorably with another one, saying, \\"He loves his whozit spiral!\\" By highlighting that their child enjoys a different product while having no interest in this one, the reviewer emphasizes the inadequacy of the product under review. This comparison strengthens the negative tone and could potentially lead potential buyers to explore alternative options like the “whozit spiral.” 4. Choice of words: The reviewer's choice of words, such as \\"didn't\\" and \\"falling off,\\" helps contribute to the negative tone. They have chosen to use language that emphasizes issues, frustrations, and dissatisfaction, providing an overall impression of disappointment with the product. In conclusion, the negative tone of the product review is apparent through the content and language used by the reviewer. It highlights the product's compatibility issues, lack of child engagement, and unfavorable comparison to another product, which could potentially deter potential buyers from considering or purchasing the product in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Compare the meanings of both sentences - Both sentences express uncertainty about the involvement of \\"she\\" in the situation. However, the first sentence states it as an opinion or speculation, while the second sentence is a direct question. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence - If Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1, it means that the truth of Sentence 1 necessarily implies the truth of Sentence 2. In other words, if you believe Sentence 1 is true, you must also believe that Sentence 2 has to be true.

Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of 50,000.

Extras is a British sitcom about extras working in television, film, and theatre. The series was co-produced by the BBC and HBO and was created, written, and directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, both of whom also starred in it. Extras follows the lives of Andy Millman (Gervais), his platonic friend Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jensen), and Andy's substandard agent and part-time retail employee Darren Lamb (Merchant) as Millman muddles through life as an anonymous \\"background performer\\" who eventually finds success as a B-level sitcom star. Extras has two series of six episodes each as well as a Christmas Special. When the Whistle Blows is the show-within-a-show sitcom created, co-written by and starring Andy Millman. It was first mentioned in episode 1.3, as a script that Millman had written and given to Darren, who neglected to read it (in a recurring joke, he would frequently forget the name of the show, often calling it Where the Wind Blows and even confusing it with The Wind in the Willows). The script was turned into a sitcom on BBC One in the first season finale, after Millman gave the script to Patrick Stewart. Excerpts from the sitcom are featured in the second season, and many of the Extras second season plotlines revolve around Millman's experiences on and around the show.  When the Whistle Blows is set in a Wigan factory canteen. The humour is broad and lowbrow in the manner of many catchphrase-based sitcoms. The main catchphrase of the show, \\"Are you 'avin' a laugh?,\\" is spoken by Millman. The show is unpopular with critics but popular with the public. It does receive a BAFTA nomination, although Millman suspects it is there simply to make up the numbers, and in the end it loses to an unspecified programme by Stephen Fry.  Millman is deeply unhappy with the show, feeling that too many people have interfered with his original ideas in the hunt for ratings. It appears that Millman originally set out to do a comedy similar to The Office, with true-to-life characters in a realistic work environment, without a studio audience or canned laughter. After being forced to collaborate and compromise many of his ideas with producers at the BBC, the show is transformed into lowest common denominator fare with each character having his/her own catchphrase which are repeated ad nauseam to the delight of its 6 million viewers. The show is further debased by the unexplained guest appearance of Coldplay's Chris Martin, in episode 2.4, which bears no relation to the plot and which Millman openly opposes, going so far as to utter the on-camera line, \\"Chris Martin, what are you doing in a factory in Wigan? It's mental!\\"  The presence of studio audiences/canned laughter, and the reliance on funny wigs, costumes and catchphrases for humour is a comment on British comedy hits such as Little Britain and The League of Gentlemen. Many people that Millman sees at the recording of the pilot wear T-shirts displaying comedy catchphrases, such as \\"Wassup\\", \\"It's Chico Time\\", \\"I'm a lady!\\", \\"Am I bovvered?\\" and \\"Garlic bread?.\\" (These shirts are not shown in the US version of Extras.) Some of the reviews that the show gets refer to it as a \\"time warp comedy\\", and Millman's character talks about 1970s catchphrases such as Mr Humphreys' \\"I'm Free\\" (from Are You Being Served?) and Frank Spencer's \\"Ooh Betty\\" (from Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em), suggesting that it is also partly sending up 1970s British comedy. In episode 2.5, Germaine Greer suggests that When the Whistle Blows is \\"sub Carry On\\".","output":"This text is about the British sitcom \\"Extras\\" and its show-within-a-show, \\"When the Whistle Blows.\\" The primary focus is on \\"Extras\\" and its characters, primarily Andy Millman, who is also the creator and star of \\"When the Whistle Blows.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is related to the choice of the .io domain for Bitcoin gambling sites, while the second question is about creating a Bitcoin investment site similar to btclab.io. I will provide detailed answers to both questions below. 1. Why do most of the gambling Bitcoin sites have an .io domain? The popularity of the .io domain among Bitcoin gambling sites is due to several factors: a. Availability: Many popular domain extensions such as .com, .net, or .org have been occupied by countless websites, making it difficult to find a suitable domain name. The .io domain is less crowded, making it easier for website owners to find their desired domain names. b. Tech-savvy image: The .io domain extension originates from the British Indian Ocean Territory, but it has become popular among tech startups and online gaming platforms because the \\"io\\" abbreviation is often associated with input/output in computing. This creates a tech-savvy image for the domain, which appeals to the cryptocurrency and gaming communities. c. Perception of trust and security: The .io domain has been adopted by numerous reputable tech companies and online platforms, consequently gaining a reputation for trustworthiness and security. For Bitcoin gambling sites, which deal with sensitive financial transactions, using a trusted domain extension can be crucial for attracting users. d. Branding and marketing: The .io domain is relatively short and memorable, and it can be used to create a unique and easily recognizable brand name for a Bitcoin gambling site. This can help the site stand out in a competitive market and attract more users. 2. How can I make a Bitcoin investment site like btclab.io? To create a Bitcoin investment site similar to btclab.io, you'll need to follow several steps: a. Understand the business model: Research Bitcoin investment sites like btclab.io to understand their business model, revenue streams, and offerings. This will provide you with a solid foundation and help you make informed decisions about how to structure and operate your own site. b. Develop a plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining the goals, target audience, revenue models, marketing strategies, and operational plans for your Bitcoin investment site. A well-defined plan will help guide your next steps and ensure you stay focused on achieving your objectives. c. Register a domain and choose a hosting provider: Choose a suitable domain name for your investment site (consider the factors mentioned in the first question) and register it. Select a reliable web hosting provider that meets your site's requirements in terms of performance, security, and scalability. d. Develop the platform: You'll need to design and develop the Bitcoin investment platform, either by hiring a team of developers or using website builders that offer ready-made solutions. Ensure that your platform is user-friendly, secure, and has all the necessary features for deposits, withdrawals, and managing investments. e. Implement security measures: Your platform will handle sensitive financial information and transactions, so security must be a top priority. Implement SSL encryption, two-factor authentication, and other security measures to protect your users' data and funds. f. Obtain necessary licenses and comply with regulations: Research local and international laws regarding the operation of a Bitcoin investment site, and obtain any necessary licenses or permits to ensure your platform complies with all regulations. g. Market your platform: Develop comprehensive marketing strategies to promote your Bitcoin investment site. Utilize social media, content marketing, search engine optimization, and other techniques to reach and engage your target audience. h.

Will decreasing pressure of a container of gas while the temperature remains constant increase or decrease its volume?  Hint: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. The answer is:","output":"The volume will increase.  The reasoning lies with Boyle’s Law, as hinted in the question. This law states that pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when the temperature is kept constant. This means that as the pressure increases, volume decreases and vice versa. So, when we apply this to the question, if the pressure of a container of gas is decreased while its temperature remains constant, the volume of the gas would increase as per Boyle’s Law. Hence, the solution to the question would be increasing the volume of gas.  This step-by-step process applies Boyle’s Law to the given question and helps us arrive at a logical and scientifically accurate conclusion.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Moreover, SARS has led to new uncertainties. However, the negative impact on tourism in general should not be overestimated. In this sentence, it is stated that the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak has generated new concerns and uncertainties among people. Despite this, the speaker suggests that it is important not to overestimate the negative consequences that this situation might have on the tourism industry as a whole. The SARS outbreak occurred in 2002-2003, and it greatly affected the global community. Originating in southern China, the virus spread to over two dozen countries, infecting thousands of people and causing hundreds of deaths. As a result, countries around the world implemented strict measures to prevent its further spread, including travel restrictions and heightened health screenings at airports. During this period, the tourism industry in affected regions took a significant hit, as people became hesitant to travel due to fear of contracting the virus. The global economy also suffered as a result, with several industries feeling the pressure of the SARS outbreak. Although the SARS outbreak did lead to new uncertainties and a temporary decline in tourism, it is important to note that the overall negative impact on the industry was not as detrimental as initially feared. This is perhaps due in part to the relatively quick containment of the virus and the implementation of effective public health measures. In the years that followed the SARS outbreak, the tourism industry rebounded and continued to grow, proving that it is a resilient sector. The experiences of both public health organizations and the tourism sector during the SARS outbreak proved invaluable in dealing with future health crises, leading to improvements in preparedness and response. In summary, the SARS outbreak did create new uncertainties and hinder the tourism industry temporarily, but it is crucial not to overestimate the long-term negative effects on the industry. The global community has shown its ability to bounce back from such crises, and the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak have contributed to better preparedness for future health emergencies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Without enough blood, the brain lives for only three to five minutes. More often the doctors can't fix the damage. Sometimes they are afraid to try something to help because it is dangerous to work on the brain. The doctors might make the person worse if he operates on the brain. Dr. Robert White, a famous professor and doctor, thinks he knows a way to help. He thinks doctors should make the brain very cold. If it is very cold, the brain can live without blood for 30 minutes. This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain. Dr. White tried his idea on 13 monkeys. First he taught them to do different jobs, and then he operated on them. He made the monkeys' blood go through a machine. The machine cooled the blood. Then the machine sent the blood back to the monkeys' brains. When the brain's temperature was 10degC, Dr. White stopped the blood to the brain. After 30 minutes he turned the blood back on. He warmed the blood again. After their operations the monkeys were like they had been before. They were healthy and busy. Each one could still do the jobs the doctor had taught them. The answer to this question is:","output":"Which of the following statements accurately describes the method Dr. Robert White used to increase the survival time of a brain without blood supply? A. He used a special drug to increase the brain's oxygen levels. B. He developed a brain surgery technique that reduced the risk of making the patient worse. C. He cooled the blood and lowered the brain's temperature to allow it to survive without blood for 30 minutes. D. He replaced the damaged parts of the brain with artificial components. Answer: C. He cooled the blood and lowered the brain's temperature to allow it to survive without blood for 30 minutes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Premise: \\"More specifically they finance spending of many types to promote the general welfare, provide for the common defense, and ensure domestic  national defense, a judicial system, aid to the elderly, construction of infrastructure, education and training, and so forth.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"many types of spending are financed to promote general welfare.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"More specifically they finance spending of many types to promote the general welfare, provide for the common defense, and ensure domestic national defense, a judicial system, aid to the elderly, construction of infrastructure, education and training, and so forth\\" is true, it provides strong support for the hypothesis \\"many types of spending are financed to promote the general welfare.\\"  To evaluate this claim further, let's break down each aspect of the premise and determine its contribution to the general welfare: 1. Providing for the common defense: When a government finances spending for the common defense, including national defense and domestic security, it is helping to create a safe environment in which citizens can live and prosper. This investment protects the nation's borders and the public from external and internal threats, ensuring the stability necessary for a thriving society. 2. Ensuring a judicial system: A well-functioning judicial system is crucial for maintaining the rule of law, which serves as the backbone of a stable and orderly society. By providing funds to build and maintain courts, train judges, and support legal services, the government contributes to upholding citizens' rights and promoting a fair and just social environment. 3. Aid to the elderly: When a government provides financial support to the elderly population, it helps to ensure that they can maintain a decent quality of life and access essential services, such as health care and housing. This contribution may come in the form of pensions or social security payments, which are designed to guarantee a minimum standard of living for older citizens who may not have other means of support. 4. Construction of infrastructure: Investing in infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, is a critical component of fostering economic growth and promoting the general welfare. Good infrastructure facilitates the movement of people, goods, and services, which in turn boosts trade, job creation, and overall economic productivity. In addition, infrastructure investments tend to generate jobs, benefitting both local communities and the broader economy. 5. Education and training: By financing education and training programs, the government plays a vital role in equipping citizens with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the modern economy. This investment not only benefits the individuals who gain access to better educational and career opportunities, but also serves the broader community by fostering economic growth, social mobility, and a more knowledgeable and engaged citizenry. The above-mentioned elements demonstrate that the premise encompasses various types of spending aimed at promoting the general welfare. Therefore, the premise strongly entails the hypothesis \\"many types of spending are financed to promote general welfare.\\" In conclusion, if the given premise is true, it tells us that the government prioritizes a wide range of spending areas to improve the well-being of its citizens, ultimately supporting the broad goal of promoting general welfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I can use this background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  Now, I have a new situation: In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B.  Answer this question please: Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","output":"The group A of antelope is more adapted to the environment in sub-Saharan Africa. This is because they possess longer necks and stronger teeth, which enable them to easily pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region. This gives them a competitive advantage over the group B of antelope, who have shorter necks and weaker teeth, making it harder for them to access the same resources. As a result, group A is more \\"fit\\" to survive in this particular environment, and their advantageous traits will likely lead to greater reproductive success. This means that over time, the population of group A antelope would increase due to their better adaptation to the environment, while the population of group B antelope may decrease or stay relatively smaller. This is an example of natural selection at work, where individuals with advantageous traits become more common in a population over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most? - A Frenchman just quarreled with the barber who did his hair badly in New York. - An American just had a wonderful dinner in a well known restaurant in New York. - A Japanese businessman asked for a pizza delivery from a Pizza Hut in New York. - A Chinese student enjoyed his meal in a famous fast food restaurant in New York.

The Fix's Callum Borchers explains why that isn't likely. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)      Forty-eight hours ago, the campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the super PACs that supported him had apparently found a cohesive, potent attack on Donald Trump -- that the mogul was a \\"con artist\\" who defrauded \\"the little guy.\\"      Any attempt to cohere around an anti-Trump message is gone. For the past 24 hours, Rubio and surrogates have eviscerated Trump for a rambling non-response to a question about endorsements from white supremacists. And for just the last hour, Rubio allies and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) have demanded answers from Trump on BuzzFeed's report that the candidate had more immigration wiggle room than he'd admitted.      Citing \\"sources familiar with the recording and transcript\\" of Trump's candidate interview with the New York Times, BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said that Trump had given the impression -- off the record -- that he was flexible on his pledge to deport every undocumented immigrant. Mass deportation, suggested one Times editor, might be Trump's opening bid in a negotiation, not his do-or-die policy.      \\"What exactly did Trump say about immigration, about deportations, about the wall?\\" asked Smith. \\"Did he abandon a core promise of his campaign in a private conversation with liberal power brokers in New York?\\"      It took Cruz no time at all to demand that Trump ask the newspaper to release the conversation.      Cruz, gaggle live on CNN: \\"I call on Donald: Ask the New York Times to release the tape\\" — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) February 29, 2016      Joe Pounder, the opposition researcher who has become Rubio's most effective messenger on Twitter, led a volley of Rubio supporters in pushing the story.      THE CON: @BuzzFeed: Donald Trump Secretly Told The New York Times What He Really Thinks About Immigration https://t.co/LVO9zrQ8YN — Joe Pounder (@PounderFile) February 29, 2016      Hours later, Rubio himself told a crowd in Arkansas that Trump had told the newspaer \\"what he really believes about immigration, what sounds like what he told them was different than what he is telling you but it was off the record.\\"      \\"Donald Trump should ask The New York Times to release the audio of his interview with him so we can see exactly what it is he truly believes about this issue that he has made the cornerstone of his campaign,\\" said Rubio.      The innuendo here may guarantee that Trump gets asked whether he wants the tape to be released. But the reportable substance of the interview mirrors something Trump said to the Washington Examiner's Byron York just a week after the Times interview. Pressed by York, Trump admitted there might be \\"give and take\\" when it came to his hard-line positions.      So I look at deporting all illegal immigrants. I look at a temporary ban of Muslims coming to the United States. They get a lot of attention. Are they opening positions in a negotiation? I'm not saying there can't be some give and take, but at some point we have to look at these things. You look at the radical Islamic terrorism and you look at what's going on, we have to take a serious look. There's tremendous hatred. You look at illegal immigration and all that's taking place with respect to illegal immigration, whether it's the crime or the economy, I mean, it affects many different elements. It doesn't mean I'm hard and fast 100 percent, but we [need] to get a lot of what I'm asking for, or we're not going to have a country any more. So they are opening positions? They are very strong positions. It doesn't mean you're not going to negotiate a little bit, but I guess there will always be some negotiation. But they are very strong positions, and I would adhere to those positions very strongly. That doesn't mean that at some point we won't talk a little bit about some negotiation. Who wouldn't do that?      Trump is a unique figure in American rhetoric, both undisciplined about his words and ruthlessly on-message. It's possible he revealed more to the Times -- that's why rivals will demand he get the tape released. It's more possible, even likely, that he give the Times a version of his \\"give and take\\" spiel.      Trump's \\"tell it like it is\\" persona has won him thousands of votes. It has also survived umpteen reality-based attacks that cited his own words against him. In the white heat of Super Tuesday, the \\"secret tape\\" is not just a MacGuffin, but a demonstration of how hard it is to stick to an anti-Trump message. ||||| The New York Times is sitting on an audio recording that some of its staff believes could deal a serious blow to Donald Trump, who, in an off-the-record meeting with the newspaper, called into question whether he would stand by his own immigration views.            Trump visited the paper's Manhattan headquarters on Tuesday, Jan. 5, as part of a round of editorial board meetings that — as is traditional — the Democratic candidates for president and some of the Republicans attended. The meetings, conducted partly on the record and partly off the record in a 13th-floor conference room, give candidates a chance to make their pitch for the paper's endorsement.      After a dispute over Trump's suggestion of tariffs on Chinese goods, the Times released a portion of the recording. But that was from the on-the-record part of the session.      On Saturday, columnist Gail Collins, one of the attendees at the meeting (which also included editor-in-chief Dean Baquet), floated a bit of speculation in her column:      The most optimistic analysis of Trump as a presidential candidate is that he just doesn’t believe in positions, except the ones you adopt for strategic purposes when you’re making a deal. So you obviously can’t explain how you’re going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, because it’s going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session.      Sources familiar with the recording and transcript — which have reached near-mythical status at the Times — tell me that the second sentence is a bit more than speculation. It reflects, instead, something Trump said about the flexibility of his hardline anti-immigration stance.      So what exactly did Trump say about immigration, about deportations, about the wall? Did he abandon a core promise of his campaign in a private conversation with liberal power brokers in New York?            I wasn't able to obtain the recording, or the transcript, and don't know exactly what Trump said. Neither Baquet, Collins, nor various editorial board members I reached would comment on an off-the-record conversation, which the Times essentially said it cannot release without approval from Trump, given the nature of the off-the-record agreement.      Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal told me he would not comment \\"on what was off the record at our meeting with him.\\"      \\"If [Trump] wants to call up and ask us to release this transcript, he's free to do that and then we can decide what we would do,\\" Rosenthal said.      Trump, whose spokeswoman didn't respond immediately to an email, can resolve this mystery: He can ask the Times to release the tape. Will he? ||||| Photo      Donald J. Trump said he would favor a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, proposing the idea during a wide-ranging meeting with members of the editorial board of The New York Times.      Mr. Trump also spoke at length about the standoff with armed protesters who last Saturday seized the headquarters at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, suggesting that he would have called the leader of the group to try to make a deal to end it — and would have acted against them if negotiations failed because “you cannot let people take over federal property.”      In addressing the trade imbalance with China, Mr. Trump addressed an issue that has been a focus of his speeches going back to 2011, when he considered running for president when President Obama was seeking re-election. In the editorial board meeting, which was held Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that the relationship with China needs to be restructured.      “The only power that we have with China,” Mr. Trump said, “is massive trade.”      “I would tax China on products coming in,” Mr. Trump said. “I would do a tariff, yes — and they do it to us.”      Mr. Trump added that he’s “a free trader,” but that “it’s got to be reasonably fair.”      “I would do a tax. and the tax, let me tell you what the tax should be … the tax should be 45 percent,” Mr. Trump said.      China is on a path this year to surpass Canada as the biggest single trading partner of the United States, and its factories provide American consumers with lower-cost products ranging from clothing to computers, so such steep tariffs could hurt the pocketbooks of many Americans.      In early November, Mr. Trump released a little-noticed plan about changing the United States economic dynamic with China. The tariff number was not featured in the plan, but Mr. Trump called for, among other proposals, pressing to give “American workers a level playing field” to restore the manufacturing base.      In addressing the Oregon standoff, Mr. Trump also spoke about the “great anger out there” that appears to be fueling the situation in Burns, Ore.      “I think what I’d do, as president, is I would make a phone call to whoever, to the group,” he said, adding later, “I’d talk to the leader. I would talk to him and I would say, ‘You gotta get out — come see me, but you gotta get out.'”      “You cannot let people take over federal property,” Mr. Trump said. “You can’t, because once you do that, you don’t have a government anymore. I think, frankly, they’ve been there too long.”      Mr. Trump said he wasn’t necessarily suggesting a large-scale military action, but that “at a certain point you have to do something and you have to be firm and you have to be strong, you have to be a government.”      An earlier version of this post misstated the day the editorial board meeting at The New York Times was held. It was Tuesday, not Monday. ||||| The Washington Examiner's Byron York interviewed Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Tuesday afternoon aboard Trump's plane in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The talk ranged from Trump's GOP rivals to his relations with evangelicals to the November general election to abortion to his controversial proposals on deporting illegal immigrants and temporarily banning Muslims from entering to the U.S. Here is an edited transcript:      Have you seen this fight that has erupted where Jeb Bush is attacking Marco Rubio on amnesty?      I've seen a lot of fights, and the Republicans are fighting each other. They don't seem to be fighting me as much as they're fighting everybody else. Almost, they're not fighting me at all. Jeb has spent a lot of money, though, on commercials, I know, against me. That seems to be the one place. But Jeb is just going down. It's very sad when you look at what happened to Jeb Bush.      Let's go to Ted Cruz. He is apparently testing ways to attack you in Iowa. His campaign is calling people, testing, saying you have never asked God for forgiveness, saying you're a \\"New York liberal pretending to have conservative values.\\" What do you think about that?      Well, first of all, I'm a believer in a very big way. I went through my Sunday school, I've done everything that you're supposed to do and that I love doing, and I feel really great about it. I think that the evangelicals have really taken to me, and I taken to them, and I've always taken to them. I'm doing very well with the evangelicals. In fact, nationwide, I'm leading by a substantial margin.      Frankly, we're doing very well. They just came out with polls in Iowa where I'm leading, and now I'm leading basically every state and every national poll.      People understand me. They know me. I think they respect what I've done. I've built a great company, a really great company. I've had tremendous success, whether it's books or whether it's doing a tremendously successful television show called \\"The Apprentice,\\" or whether it's building a great company.      Conservatives are very worried about you. They concede that you've brought attention to issues that are important to them, like immigration or radical Islamic terrorism. But they don't believe you're one of them. Are you a conservative?      I am, and I'll tell you what will happen, I think, is they'll maybe see it more and more as time goes by.      If you think about it, if you take a look at what I've done, I've brought millions and millions of people to the Republican Party, and to the conservative party, because, as an example, the debate had 24 million people. If I wasn't in the debate, would it have had three, or four, or two, or what would it have been? And you look at the kind of numbers that they're doing on television, where every one of the stations, the networks that are covering us, and honestly in particular covering me, because I do seem to get a lot more coverage than anybody else, but their ratings are through the roof. So that focus is a very important focus because other people are allowed to take advantage of all of the eyeballs that I'm bringing to the screen.      But what makes you a conservative? What does being a conservative mean to you?      Well, I think it's just a conservative value. I'm very conservative fiscally. I mean, we owe 19 trillion, this is going to destroy our country, we're going to be destroyed by what's going on fiscally. And in terms of the economy, in terms of jobs, we're losing our jobs to everybody. You take a look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about with the closures and just pure and simple the number of jobs that have been lost, it's incredible. To places like China, Vietnam is the new hot one, they're taking our jobs. Mexico, always. They're outsmarting us at every turn, and we don't seem to be able to do it. I mean it's an incredible thing.      I will say this. In terms of conservative, I've had tremendous polling numbers with conservatives, I think to a large extent because of the border. Nobody has that issue like I have it, whether it's building the wall or closing the border and letting people in but they have to come in legally.      So why have you so many conservative leaders — the Wall Street Journal, Weekly Standard, National Review, lots of them don't think you're a conservative. They would look at what you just said about trade — they would say protectionism and tariffs, that's not conservative.      No, no, not protectionism — fairness. China is making hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us. At some point, we have to say, look, you can't do that. I mean we have rebuilt China virtually. Now, I am a free trader, 100 percent. But we can't continue to lose tremendous amounts of money to these countries. We're losing with virtually everybody, everybody that we do business with. The fact is, our leaders have been outsmarted at every step of the game. and we just can't do that.      I read Art of the Deal. And one of the things you write about is you have to be bold, you have to make a splash, you have to attract attention. You've also talked about compromise. There was a time you said there's nothing wrong with compromise — you just ask for about three times what you want, and then you get what you want.      Okay.      So I look at deporting all illegal immigrants. I look at a temporary ban of Muslims coming to the United States. They get a lot of attention. Are they opening positions in a negotiation?      I'm not saying there can't be some give and take, but at some point we have to look at these things. You look at the radical Islamic terrorism and you look at what's going on, we have to take a serious look. There's tremendous hatred. You look at illegal immigration and all that's taking place with respect to illegal immigration, whether it's the crime or the economy, I mean, it affects many different elements. It doesn't mean I'm hard and fast 100 percent, but we to get a lot of what I'm asking for, or we're not going to have a country any more.      So they are opening positions?      They are very strong positions. It doesn't mean you're not going to negotiate a little bit, but I guess there will always be some negotiation. But they are very strong positions, and I would adhere to those positions very strongly. That doesn't mean that at some point we won't talk a little bit about some negotiation. Who wouldn't do that?      Do you see yourself as being able to pivot to a general election? What does pivoting to a general election mean to you?      I feel very strongly about what I'm saying. And it's pretty well documented what I'm saying. whether it's on illegal immigration or whether it's on Obamacare, which you have to repeal and replace. It's going to probably die on its own volition. I would say in '17 it's going to die anyway, because it's just out of control. You look at what's happening with the premiums, I mean the increases are incredible — 25, 35, 45 percent, the deduction, the deductability. What's going on with Obamacare is something that cannot continue to go on, because our healthcare system is a mess.      So what I want to do is I want to come up with great healthcare. There's not a lot of negotiation on that, because Obamacare just isn't working — you know it, I know it, and probably pretty much everyone knows it, including the administration.      A question about abortion. The Mexico City policy, the policy that does not allow federal dollars to go to international groups that perform or support abortions. Reagan instituted it, Clinton got rid of it, George W. Bush reinstated it, Obama got rid of it. If you were president, would you reinstate it?      Yes, I would reinstate it.      Let's talk about the Democratic race. Who would you rather face in a general election, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders?      Very interesting question. I've really had my mind set on Hillary. We've had some very good polls over the last few days, and actually even before that, some excellent polls saying that I beat her. And I've really been thinking in terms of her, but now I see what's happening and there's a possibility that it won't be her. I think beating him ultimately would be easier than beating her. I don't really care who I face. I want to face whoever it is. It's like the baseball team, they say who would you rather face? The best answer is whoever it is that's there.      I'm looking forward to winning here. A lot of people have dropped out. A lot of people will drop out after Iowa and New Hampshire. I think you'll see a lot of people drooping out, which is a good thing, not a bad thing. Good for me. The poll numbers have been fabulous. I have some polls now at 42, which is pretty amazing when you have 14 to 15 people. But I look forward to running against whoever it is. It doesn't make that much difference to me. I think I'll beat Hillary. I think Sanders actually would be easier to beat. But it makes no difference to me whatsoever.      In 2012, Mitt Romney got just 206 electoral votes to Obama's 332. Romney lost Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia. Which of those states that Romney lost can you win?      I think I can win all of them. Look at what I'm doing in Florida. I'm way ahead of Jeb Bush, way ahead of Rubio, and he's a sitting senator and a longtime governor. I'm way ahead. In Ohio I'm way ahead of Kasich, who's a successful governor of the state of Ohio. I'm way ahead. Pennsylvania, I'm doing great, and I think that we're going to win Pennsylvania. I think we're going to win Virginia. I have a lot of property in Virginia, I have a lot of jobs in Virginia, frankly. I employ a lot — I have thousands and thousands of people that I employ — Virginia just happens to be one of those places.      I think I can win all or most of those places. I also think I can do really well in New York and places that people never even thought about. I don't know if you saw there was recently an article where upstate New York, I just absolutely — I mean, they like me, I like them. it's one of those things. I think I can do great in New York. I think I can do great in New York. Now, you win New York, you have a whole new deal, because of the size of that state. So I think we can do very well in New York. I think I have a real chance of winning New York.      I have a chance of winning places that every single one of the people that I'm running against, they can't even think about it.      Would you self-fund in a general election?      We haven't really given it much thought. I'm self-funding my existing campaign. I'll tell you it's having a huge impact, when I mention that I'm self-funding, and you've seen it. I have not gone that far. It's a much different kind of a thing, because there you have a party backing you and it seems sort of a little bit, maybe, foolish to say that instead of the party backing you put up your own money.      But it's something that I am thinking about already. I mean, I'm looking at the poll numbers and I'm starting to think a little bit ahead, although I don't want to go too far ahead. But it's something I am thinking about. I'll make a decision in the future.      Could you elaborate on that a little bit? What are you thinking in terms of a general election structure?      First of all, I don't want to think too much about general election right now. I want to get through what we're doing right now. We had a total of 17 [candidates], now we're down to 13, and we have a long way to go. So I'm not thinking too much in advance, other than I think I can win a lot of states that a lot of other people can't win. One of the articles came out recently and they said I'll be taking a tremendous chunk out of the Democrats. I really believe it, and no other Republican's going to do that.      People are saying that I may get 20 percent of the Democrat vote, and I believe that is maybe true, and maybe even on the light side. So I think I'll be able to do things that no other Republican is able to do.      The debate is coming up in a day or so. Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul, who were in the main debate, are now out. What's your reaction? You now have seven in the field. Too big?      I like seven better than I like 10. I like seven better than I like eight. The number is getting smaller. I'm very satisfied with that. I'd like to see a smaller group. You know, last time — 'Please discuss your views on terrorism, you have 30 seconds' — it's a little bit ridiculous when you think of it. So I like more time. I would prefer having more time. So obviously the fewer people on the stage, the more time you have individually. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets      When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

The story takes place in Hollywood in the early 1930s, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style (such as using a hand-held camera) for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway. On the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress named Harlene (Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the \\"talkies\\" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also named to the all-time All-Pro team selected in 1968 and to the National Football League (NFL) 1950s All-Decade Team. A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls. In January 1945, the Cleveland Rams selected Hirsch in the first round (fifth overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft. In May, he announced that he would not sign a contract with the Rams, stating that he intended to return to the University of Wisconsin after his discharge from the military.  He ultimately opted not to play in the NFL, instead playing for the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose the Rockets because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch's coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7-32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with the Rockets was the worst decision he ever made.  In a remarkable display of versatility, Hirsch appeared in all 14 games for the Rockets in 1946, contributing 1,445 yards: 384 kickoff return yards and one touchdown; 347 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns; 235 punt return yards and one touchdown; 226 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown; 156 passing yards and one passing touchdown; and 97 return yards on six interceptions.  In September 1947, Hirsch caught a 76-yard touchdown pass for an AAFC record. However, injuries limited Hirsch to five games in 1947. He was described in December 1947 as probably \\"the highest paid waterboy in pro football.\\"  In the fifth game of the 1948 season, Hirsch sustained a fracture on the right side of his skull after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.

Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Options: - To provide them with some relief from the snow - Because she owed them money - not enough information - Because it was the only work available in the area Answer:","output":"To provide them with some relief from the snow"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the death of Lysimachus, one of his officers, Philetaerus, took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent. His descendant, Attalus I, defeated the invading Galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king. Attalus I (241–197BC), was a staunch ally of Rome against Philip V of Macedon during the first and second Macedonian Wars.

Help as much as you can. My best story is about Santa Claus. A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Translate to English","output":"This should apply especially to imports. In this context, the statement emphasizes the importance of considering specific rules and regulations for imported goods and products. This is particularly important in international trade, as it ensures a level playing field for domestic and foreign suppliers while also protecting the interests of consumers. Indeed, there are various reasons why one might highlight the importance of applying certain standards to imports. The primary concerns often include: 1. Ensuring the quality of products: Imported goods should meet the same quality criteria as domestic products to protect the end consumers. This may involve enforcing strict guidelines related to material safety, durability, and performance. By doing so, countries can avoid potential risks associated with low-quality imports and ensure that products meet consumer expectations. 2. Protecting domestic industries: In order to maintain a competitive environment and support local businesses, some countries may impose specific import regulations. These may include tariffs, quotas, or other trade barriers designed to manage or limit the flow of imported goods and protect domestic industries from unfair competition. 3. Safeguarding intellectual property: Implementing regulations on imports also serves to protect intellectual property rights. Many countries have laws prohibiting the importation of counterfeit or pirated products. This not only shields local producers from the negative consequences associated with these illegal trade practices but also ensures that consumers do not purchase counterfeit goods, which can pose risks to safety and quality. 4. Environmental and social considerations: Applying standards to imports can also address environmental and social concerns, such as the environmental impact of certain production methods or the potential exploitation of labor in other countries. By requiring imported goods to adhere to specific environmental and labor standards, countries can promote ethical and sustainable trade practices globally. 5. Compliance with international trade agreements: Many countries participate in international trade agreements, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which establish rules for the liberalization of global trade. Under these agreements, countries must adhere to specific standards and practices related to imports and exports. By applying similar standards to imports, countries can maintain compliance with these agreements and ensure a fair and equitable global trading system. Overall, the statement highlights the significance of considering imports when establishing and enforcing various rules, regulations, and standards. By doing so, countries can maintain a fair, competitive, and sustainable trading environment while protecting the interests of their businesses and consumers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \\"killed by that dreadful business\\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname \\"widow of Windsor\\". Question: Who took on most of Victoria's duties while she grieved her mothers death?","output":"During the grieving period following the death of Queen Victoria's mother, it was her husband, Prince Albert, who took on most of her duties. Despite suffering from chronic stomach trouble himself, Prince Albert stepped in to relieve his wife of her responsibilities as she dealt with the immense emotional impact and heartbreak that followed the loss of her mother. Albert's compassionate act showcased his support and love for Queen Victoria during her time of intense grief."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Homeland Security chief John Kelly said the \\"change in trends\\" was a result of Donald Trump's tough policies. The president has signed an executive order for an \\"impassable physical barrier\\" on the US-Mexico border and issued new guidance on deportations. The measures have been condemned by Mexico as \\"hostile\\" and \\"unacceptable\\". An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the US, many from Mexico. Mr Kelly said on Wednesday that the number of \\"inadmissible persons\\" crossing the US-Mexico border had dropped this year from 31,578 to 18,762 in January to February - a period when the number of arrests of illegal immigrants normally increases. \\"Since the administration's implementation of executive orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years,\\" he said. New rules announced by Mr Trump's administration last month included plans to send undocumented people to Mexico, even if they are not Mexicans, and expand the criteria for immediate deportations. The government said the new guidelines would not usher in mass deportations, but were designed to empower agents to enforce laws already on the books. Mr Trump has also ordered  a wall be built on the Mexican border and insisted Mexico will pay for it, despite its repeated refusals. The president made immigration and border control a key part of his election campaign, promising to protect Americans from \\"bad dudes\\". Meanwhile, his revised travel ban, signed on Monday, barring people from six mainly Muslim countries has faced its first legal challenge from the state of Hawaii. State lawyers have asked for an emergency block on the order, saying the measure will harm its residents, businesses and schools. Mr Trump's previous order was halted by the US federal courts amid concerns that it unfairly targeted Muslims. It caused chaos at airports and mass protests. Although the revised measure removed some of the more controversial language on religious minorities, Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said it still constituted a \\"Muslim ban\\" due to the countries involved and past statements from the administration. The directive, which includes a 120-day ban on all refugees, takes effect on 16 March. Citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the other six countries on the original 27 January order, will once more be subject to a 90-day travel ban.

Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo   voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Which of the following statements best proves that Horie's latest voyage was meaningful?

After a Bengals punt, the Patriots scored the first points of the game, racing 72 yards in 5 plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Wes Welker. Following a Bengals punt, the Patriots marched all the way to the Bengals 14, but had to settle for a 32-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski, extending the lead to 10-0.

After another Bengals punt, the Patriots engineered a 10 play, 80-yard drive, scoring on another touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, widening the lead to 17-0. The Bengals reached Patriots territory for the first time on their next drive, but Gary Guyton intercepted Carson Palmer at the 41 and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a big 24-0 lead. The Bengals finally struck on their next drive, driving to the Patriots 35, and Mike Nugent hitting a 53-yard field goal, making the score 24-3.

Palmer connected with Jordan Shipley for a 51-yard gain on the last play of the first half, but they couldn't reach the end zone and the Patriots led 24-3 at halftime. Tate returned the opening kickoff of the second half 97 yards for a touchdown, blowing the game open 31-3. The Bengals countered with a 12 play, 85-yard drive, in just under seven minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Jermaine Gresham, trimming the deficit to 31-10. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Bengals continued their comeback, marching 74 yards in 12 plays, scoring on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Chad Ochocinco, trimming the deficit to a manageable 31-17. The Patriots ended any hope of a Bengals comeback on their next drive, engineering a 14 play, 81-yard drive, in nearly eight minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to rookie Rob Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 38-17 midway through the fourth quarter. The Bengals answered, racing 76 yards in under four minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Benson, bringing the score to 38-24 with just under four minutes to play and giving the Bengals some hope, but the Patriots got the ball after Malik Johnson was flagged for illegal touch on the onside kick.

Article:The lawmakers' surprise vote to strip the Office of Congressional Ethics of its independence prompted public uproar and a dressing down from Donald Trump. \\"Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\\" the president-elect said. The secretive move, which overshadowed the first day of the 115th Congress, was reversed in an emergency meeting. Trump: No more Guantanamo releases Trump v the car industry Decoding Trump's N Korea tweet How might Trump 'drain the swamp'? Ford Motors cancels 1.6bn Mexico plant The ethics committee was set up in 2008 following a slew of scandals that resulted in several House lawmakers being jailed. Mr Trump made cleaning up corruption in Washington a key theme of his campaign, and he ended his tweet with \\"#DTS\\", an acronym for \\"drain the swamp\\". Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had argued unsuccessfully against the rule change, which was adopted on Monday night in a closed-door meeting, but he defended the proposal on Tuesday. Donald Trump's tweets have teeth. The president-elect took to social media to express his displeasure with the move and within hours those legislative efforts were abandoned. The independent ethics investigators had been a source of discomfort for members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and there was significant interest in limiting their ability to conduct inquiries. Even after Mr Trump's tweets, many congressional Republicans appeared reluctant to back down. House Speaker Paul Ryan, an initial opponent of the measure, issued a statement defending the change. That ended up being little comfort to the party rank and file, however, as pressure increased for them to bend to Mr Trump's political will. In his first confrontation with congressional leadership, the president-elect displayed his dominance. Mr Trump now has a valuable talking point when discussions inevitably turn back to his own ethical questions, such as how he will handle potential conflicts of interest involving his sprawling business empire. He has made it a bit easier, at least for now, to claim he's standing behind his drain-the-Washington-swamp campaign rhetoric. \\"I want to make clear that this House will hold its members to the highest ethical standards and the Office will continue to operate independently to provide public accountability to Congress,\\" he said. Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, lambasted the Republicans. \\"Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp', but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,\\" she said. \\"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\\" As the news spread, internet searches for \\"who is my representative\\" rocketed, according to Google Trends. House Republicans called an emergency meeting and abruptly voted to undo the change. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham took a shot at his party colleagues' decision to neuter the ethics watchdog, telling Fox News radio it was \\"the dumbest fricking thing I've ever heard\\". Under the change: Mr Ryan - who was re-elected by fellow lawmakers on Tuesday as House Speaker - had urged his party to seek bipartisan support and to wait to push for the change later. But Virginia Congressman Bob Goodlatte went ahead anyway and submitted the proposal. The Republican tweeted an op-ed he wrote arguing that the rule change would strengthen the ethics watchdog. But he faced scathing criticism on social media. \\"That simply isn't true,\\" one Twitter user replied. \\"Your disingenuousness is jaw-dropping. Shame on you.\\" Another posted: \\"You, sir, are a LIAR. Why did you meet in secret in the middle of the night?\\" \\"You are a traitor to the Constitution you swore to uphold,\\" yet another tweeted. Mr Trump's remarks about the ethics committee came on a busy morning for the president-elect's Twitter account. He also warned North Korea about its nuclear ambitions, attacked Obamacare costs and sparked a row with General Motors over its manufacturing operation in Mexico, which the car firm disputes. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The surprise vote by US lawmakers to strip the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) of its independence prompted President-elect Donald Trump to voice his disagreement via Twitter, urging Congress to focus on more important issues such as tax reform and healthcare.

Step 2: Identifying Key Elements From this statement, three key elements can be identified: the fact that there is a man, that this man has a beard, and that he is engaged in a culinary activity (flipping a crepe or omelet), which is part of cooking.  Step 3: Creating a Logical Deduction Using those key elements, we can simplify the initial sentence. So the activity of flipping a crepe or omelet implies that the man with a beard is cooking.  Therefore, from the detailed description, it is a valid logical deduction to clearly state that \\"a man with a beard is cooking\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Some animals prepare for the long winters by storing food and going dormant, a behavior called what?   A: Answer:","output":"Some animals exhibit a particular behavior to cope with the harsh conditions during long winters, which involves storing food and going into a dormant state. This behavior is called hibernation. Hibernation is an extended period of inactivity and significantly reduced metabolic processes in animals, allowing them to survive unfavorable environmental conditions, particularly those with severe cold temperatures and scarce food sources. During hibernation, an animal's body temperature, heart rate, and respiration rates decrease dramatically, enabling the conservation of energy for survival. Animals that hibernate include various mammals, such as bears, groundhogs, hedgehogs, bats, and some rodents. While some reptiles and amphibians also exhibit this behavior, it is referred to as brumation in their case. Though brumation is similar to hibernation, the key difference is that cold-blooded animals can still be active during brumation, albeit with reduced metabolic processes. It is essential for these animals to store food and accumulate fat reserves in the months leading to winter. They feed extensively and build up extra body fat, which serves as a source of stored energy during the prolonged period of dormancy. Additionally, some animals, like squirrels, collect and stash large amounts of food in their dens, which they can access when required. As winter approaches, hibernating animals take refuge in dens, burrows, or rock crevices, protecting them from freezing temperatures, predators, and other environmental threats. During hibernation, their metabolic processes decrease significantly, and they can survive for days, weeks, or even months without eating or drinking. When the conditions become less harsh, and temperatures rise, these animals gradually come out of their dormant state and resume their normal activities. They may initially feel weak and disoriented due to the long period of inactivity. However, they quickly regain strength and return to their typical behavior patterns, foraging, mating, and completing their life cycle. In conclusion, hibernation is a biological adaptation that enables some animals to conserve energy, protect themselves from the harsh winter environment, and ensure their survival. By storing food and going dormant, these animals can withstand the unfavorable conditions of long winters and emerge healthy when the weather becomes favorable again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Military Notification and Response. Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command. In addition to notifications within the FAA, Boston Center took the initiative, at 8:34, to contact the military through the FAA's Cape Cod facility. The center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City, unaware it had been phased out. At 8:37:52, Boston Center reached NEADS. This was the first notification received by the military-at any level-that American 11 had been hijacked: FAA: Hi. Boston Center TMU [Traffic Management Unit], we have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out. NEADS: Is this real-world or exercise? FAA: No, this is not an exercise, not a test. NEADS ordered to battle stations the two F-15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Massachusetts, 153 miles away from New York City. The air defense of America began with this call. At NEADS, the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr. After ordering the Otis fighters to battle stations, Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold, commanding general of the First Air Force and NORAD's Continental Region. Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters. General Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to \\"go ahead and scramble them, and we'll get authorities later.\\" General Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report. F-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is the name of the general involved in the report?\\" is \\"Larry Arnold\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information given in the paragraph, the name of the general involved in the report is \\"Larry Arnold\\".

A lotta wild stuff down there nobody's been runnin' brands on anythin' much since '61. Does it follow that \\"They have been running brands on everything since 1961.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"A lotta wild stuff down there nobody's been runnin' brands on anythin' much since '61\\" does not necessarily follow that \\"They have been running brands on everything since 1961.\\" In fact, it seems to suggest the opposite. Parsing the given statement, we can break it down into its components and analyze it further: 1. \\"A lotta wild stuff down there\\": This phrase implies that there is a lot of uncontrolled or untamed activity or events happening in a particular area or situation. It suggests chaos, a lack of order, and possibly a lack of organization or oversight. 2. \\"nobody's been runnin' brands on anythin' much since '61\\": The term \\"runnin' brands\\" could be interpreted as placing identifying marks, logos, or labels on items, which can refer to claiming ownership, controlling, or overseeing something. In this context, the phrase likely means that there has not been much control, ownership, or oversight over whatever the speaker is referring to since 1961. The use of \\"much\\" here indicates that there may have been some attempts at control or organization, but they have been minimal and potentially ineffective. Based on this analysis, the original statement suggests that there has been a lack of control, organization, or oversight in a certain area or situation since 1961, not that \\"They have been running brands on everything since 1961.\\" If anything, the sentence implies that branding activity or control was limited and not widespread after 1961. In conclusion, the original statement does not indicate that branding and control have been widespread since 1961. Instead, it suggests a lack of structure, control, or oversight from that point onward. It's important to consider the context in which this phrase is used, as it could have different meanings based on the situation in which it is spoken. However, the information provided in the question does not support the interpretation that \\"They have been running brands on everything since 1961.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Mexico storyline[edit] In Mexico, police officer Javier Rodriguez (del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez (Vargas) stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the ObregÃ³n brothers. Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the ObregÃ³n cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the ObregÃ³n brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the JuÃ¡rez Cartel, the rival of the ObregÃ³n brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit. Javier's partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison. Javier explains to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. In Mexico, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises when he retired in 2004? from the following article ?  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Martínez Falls Short, but Mets Stay in Place for Wild Card Given Martínez’s postseason experience and lack of a valid alternative, it is almost inconceivable that the Mets would not pitch him should they need a fourth starter in a potential first-round series. But it will be challenging for Manuel to balance how Martínez has pitched with how the team fares during his starts. They have lost his last three, and the degree of culpability has diminished each time. He gave up six runs Sept. 7 against Philadelphia, four Monday night in Washington (when seven days’ rest affected the control of his breaking pitches) and followed up that performance Saturday by posting a nearly identical pitching line: nine hits, four runs (three in the first inning and one in the sixth), three walks and seven strikeouts. The Mets have scored six runs in those three starts. “I can’t say that losing his last three starts were all him,” Manuel said. He added: “I don’t know if we gotten off to good starts when he has pitched. It’s just one of those things that you run into every now and then.” Martínez said he did not want to use his difficult season as an excuse — his hamstring strain, his father’s death, his inconsistency — but he acknowledged that he has felt out of sync since rejoining the Mets after his father’s funeral in late July. “It’s really hard for me to be 100 percent and play baseball like I used to, just play baseball, hey, this is beautiful, healthy and all that,” Martínez said. “It’s very different than previous years. This year has been a hard year for me, a year with a lot of distractions and I haven’t really gained a lot from the game.” One trend that has followed Martínez all season is his first-inning struggles. Opponents entered Saturday hitting .347 with six homers off him in the first — compared with .278 with 12 homers the rest of the game — and have scored first-inning runs in each of his last four starts, including three runs on Saturday. “I can’t really pinpoint what’s going on, but maybe I’m not being as aggressive as I should sometimes,” said Martínez, before referring to his stretch in August of allowing first-inning homers. “I try to be aggressive, then gave up a couple of homers, it makes you wonder, it makes you start thinking, so you start to be a little more cautious. Thinking a bit too much, I think. Must be the reason. But without a doubt, I have to find out as soon as possible.” Martínez seems to get stronger, and better, as the game progresses. After giving up four hits in the first, he gave up one each in his next five. The final hit, a sixth-inning single by Josh Anderson, came after Manuel visited Martínez, his pitch count at 110. Martínez told Manuel he wanted to face him, and Anderson poked a changeup into right field to score Brandon Jones with the Braves’ fourth run. “What you hope for in the most part is the guy gives you a chance to win,” Manuel said. “I thought we had a chance with the game 3-2. We didn’t do much damage offensively, and that was that.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Martínez Falls Short, And the Mets Follow.

Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was forced to turn down a song since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single? from the following article ?  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The... The answer to this question is:","output":"Jones.

Wearing a pocket square was considered desirable by Robert but not Michael because","output":"Wearing a pocket square was considered desirable by Robert but not Michael because the two of them had markedly different fashion sensibilities, value systems, and social contexts that influenced their personal preferences when it came to accessorizing and dressing up for formal occasions. For Robert, the pocket square was a significant aspect of his elegant, sophisticated style that he had cultivated over the years. He had a great appreciation for the finer things in life and took pride in ensuring that his outfits were meticulously coordinated and groomed to perfection. In his social and work circles, a well-dressed man donning suit with just the right pocket square was deemed to leave a remarkable impression and command respect among his peers. Robert strongly believed that wearing a pocket square demonstrated his attention to detail, refinement, and confidence, which played an essential role in his career progression. Moreover, he found great pleasure in experimenting with a wide variety of folds and colors to express his personality and refine his signature style. For him, the pocket square symbolized both a functional and a fashionable accessory: it not only allowed him to wipe his glasses or clean his smartphone screen but also allowed him to express his creativity in the choice of fabrics, textures, and patterns to complement his formal attire. Michael, on the other hand, had quite a different perspective when it came to fashion choices. He followed a more minimalist, understated approach to dressing. For him, the functionality and comfort of his clothing overruled any additional decorative elements such as a pocket square. He saw pocket squares as unnecessary, superfluous accessories that only served cosmetic purposes, without contributing much to practicality or the overall outfit. Moreover, Michael was always apprehensive that the addition of a pocket square would make him appear too flashy or overdressed, thereby drawing unwanted attention and discomfort. In his view, conserving a relaxed, informal, and unpretentious demeanor was his priority even at formal events. He was more likely to express his style and preferences through the quality of his suits, the fit of his shirt, and the choice of his tie, rather than indulging in any add-on elements. Besides, Michael's social and work circles did not assign tremendous importance to the finer details of formal dressing, so he felt no pressure to conform to the practice of wearing pocket squares despite their popularity among a certain demographic. Thus, Michael found it more aligned with his personal philosophy and ethos to avoid the use of pocket squares altogether, and instead, opted for a cleaner, subtle look that reflected his pragmatic and straightforward nature. In conclusion, the desirability of wearing a pocket square in the given case depends largely on the individual's personal preferences, values, and social contexts that dictate their attitude towards accessories and fashion choices. While Robert saw it as a fashion enhancer that also conveyed sophistication and attention to detail, Michael considered it an unnecessary embellishment that complicated his otherwise streamlined and minimalist style."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation: -14 = 7 * o Next, we want to find the value of o. To do that, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7 (because o is multiplied by 7): -14 ÷ 7 = o When we divide -14 by 7, we get -2: -2 = o So, o is equal to -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It can be broken down into several key components: 1. Subject: A dog 2. Action: Wears an embellished bow 3. Location: On a couch 4. Extra detail: In the sunlight The sentence is primarily about a dog and its actions in a specific setting.

Now, let's analyze the second sentence: \\"A day is lying down.\\" 1. Subject: A day 2. Action: Lying down This sentence is both confusing and unrelated to the original sentence. The subject of this sentence is \\"a day\\", which is an abstract unit of time, while the subject in the original sentence is a tangible entity, \\"a dog\\". Additionally, the action \\"lying down\\" is not applicable to the concept of a day, as days cannot perform physical actions. The sentence suggests that a division of time is somehow taking on the physical characteristics of a living being, which doesn't make sense logically or linguistically. Therefore, the sentence \\"A day is lying down.\\" is not a true sentence when we take into account the information provided in the original sentence.

Article: This is a tense time for students in America,with the exam season in full swing and the stress and anxiety being felt across the country.At some universities,students are reviewing their lessons,knowing that in a few weeks the stress will be over once they put pen to paper in that exam hall.For others,however,that stress and anxiety may well last a while longer as lecturers continue to refuse to set exams.No one knows when things will get back to normal. The reason behind this trouble is the ongoing argument in higher education between lecturers and employers over pay.The Association of University Teachers(AUT)are currently taking industrial action because of the fact that lecturers have been underpaid for years.Vice-presidents of the universities,who enjoy six-figure salaries,are not making any noises to suggest that this will change in the near future. The National Union of Students(NUS) ly believes that our lecturers should be better paid,and that the promises made to them during the top-up fees debate about extra income must be kept. It's shameful that 1ecturers have had to take industrial action to achieve better pay and conditions while vice-presidents'own salaries have risen 25%over the past three years.But the students who are suffering as a result of the argument must be put first.We do not agree with the attitude taken by the AUT,which is refusing to set exams.We admit that the decision to take this course of action was democratically reached.However,it is having the biggest effect on our members at this moment in time and we will continue to let the AUT know the results of this. We call on both sides to sort this mess out.Hopefully then our members can get the horrible exam season Out of the way and start planning,and enjoying,their upcoming summer holiday.

January: This month is usually in the middle of a college semester, and exam season is unlikely to be in full swing at this time. ii. March: This month also falls during the middle of the semester, and although some mid-term exams may take place, it is not typically known as the height of the exam season. iii. June: This month generally marks the end of the college semester, with final exams taking place and the beginning of the summer holiday. iv. September: This month signifies the start of a new college semester, making it an unlikely candidate for the height of the exam season. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate option based on the analysis. June (iii) is the most appropriate option as it coincides with the end of the college semester, final exams, and the start of the summer holiday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People who enjoy a dream-filled sleep are better at recalling information and making links between facts when they wake, scientists found. But recharging with a shallow nap   offers no such mental improvement, the research suggests. The results of the study add to the evidence that Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is very important to the brain's ability to strengthen memories.  An average night's sleep includes four or five periods of REM sleep, but these tend to be longer towards the end of the night. This means that adults who get less than the recommended seven to eight hours a night -- and therefore inadequate REM sleep -- may be damaging their mind's ability to form strong memories. Although REM sleep is not classified as a type of deep sleep, it is only reached after the brain has passed through deep sleep stages.   In the most recent study, participants were shown groups of three words -- such as \\"cookie\\", \\"heart\\", and \\"sixteen\\" -- and asked to find another word that can be associated with all three words. In this example, the answer would have been \\"sweet\\". They were tested once in the morning and then given the same task again in the afternoon. In between, some were allowed a nap with REM sleep, some a nap without REM sleep, while the others had a quiet rest period. The quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups showed no improvement in their test results, but the REM sleep group improved on their morning performance by an average of almost 40 percent.    Dr Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California who led the study, believes the formation of connections between previously unassociated information in the brain -- which leads to creative problem-solving -- is encouraged by mental changes which occur during REM sleep. People woken while their closed eyes made rapid movements recalled much more color1ful and detailed dreams than people woken during other stages of sleep. Question: According to the passage, to have a good memory, a person had better   _   at night. - sleep four to five hours at most - sleep as much as possible - have a shallow sleep - sleep with four or five periods of REM Answer:","output":"sleep with four or five periods of REM"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","output":"During World War 2, the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV) was a British civilian volunteer organization whose purpose was to support the country's defense, particularly in case of a German invasion. The LDV later became known as the \\"Home Guard.\\" The Home Guard was established on May 14, 1940, as a response to the threat of a German invasion of Britain. Initially called the Local Defence Volunteers, it was comprised mainly of men who were either too old or too young to serve in the regular armed forces or those who were in reserved occupations, which were essential for the war effort. The name \\"Home Guard\\" was adopted on July 22, 1940, following a suggestion by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The change of name reflected the organization's role in defending the homeland and also helped to boost morale among its members. The Home Guard had several responsibilities, including defending key locations like factories, airfields, and bridges, assisting in the event of air raids, and helping to safeguard the local population. They were also tasked with providing a second line of defense in case the regular army was overwhelmed by an invading force. Additionally, they were trained in a variety of skills, such as reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and guerrilla warfare. In total, roughly 1.5 million people served in the Home Guard during World War 2. Although they were mostly part-time volunteers, the Home Guard proved to be an important component of Britain's defense strategy. They played a crucial role in maintaining morale at home and contributed to the successful defense of the United Kingdom against the Axis powers. The Home Guard continued to operate throughout the war and was officially disbanded on December 3, 1944. However, its spirit and contributions did not go unrecognized, and the organization has been remembered and commemorated in various forms, such as books, films, and television programs, most notably in the British sitcom \\"Dad's Army,\\" which ran from 1968 to 1977."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[II] Victoria wanted to know why it happened.","output":"Maria and Victoria grew up in the same small town. Their families were friendly and they often found themselves in each other's company. As children, they were inseparable, sharing their laughter and childish dreams. However, as they entered adolescence, Victoria's attitude towards Maria changed drastically. She began teasing and taunting Maria for every little thing. Maria couldn't understand the reason behind this change, causing confusion, hurt and embarrassment as Victoria relentlessly targeted Maria in front of their friends.  Years passed, and they both moved away to chase their dreams. With distance and time, the memories of their conflict started to fade. Maria went to college, found a good job, and achieved remarkable success in her field. Victoria, as fate would have it, was successful in her field too, and the two eventually lost touch with each other. One day, Maria received an invitation to a school reunion. It had been nearly fifteen years since she had seen her old friends. Among the names listed on the invitation, Maria noticed Victoria's.  At the reunion, as the two former friends crossed paths, a mix of anxiety and curiosity ignited their exchange. Victoria was filled with remorse for her past behavior, realizing that it was an incomplete chapter in her life. Maria, on the other hand, felt a strong urge to find out why Victoria had acted the way she did.  [Option I - Maria wanted to know why it happened] Maria took the opportunity to approach Victoria, hoping to get the answers that had been bothering her for so long. She approached Victoria cautiously, uncertain of how to broach the topic. \\"Victoria, can I talk to you for a moment?\\" Maria began gently. Victoria, realizing that she couldn't avoid confronting her past, obliged. They found a quiet corner, away from the festivities, where they began their long overdue conversation. Maria breathed deeply and asked the question that had been haunting her for years, \\"Why, Victoria? Why did you tease me throughout our teenage years?\\" Victoria looked deep into Maria's eyes, sensing the years of confusion and hurt Maria must have endured. She owed her the truth. \\"Maria, I wish I could justify my actions. I was struggling with my own insecurities during those years. I was jealous of your accomplishments and happy-go-lucky nature. I resented how you were admired and adored by everyone. The teasing wasn't about you; it was about my inability to handle my feelings. I'm so sorry for the pain I caused you.\\" [Option II - Victoria wanted to know why it happened] Victoria extended an olive branch, inviting Maria for a conversation over dinner at a nearby restaurant. Maria accepted, intrigued by the opportunity to gain closure on this chapter of her life. As they settled down over dinner, Victoria hesitantly began, \\"Maria, I invited you here because I have something important to tell you. I've been haunted by the way I treated you during our teenage years. I couldn't understand why I acted the way I did, and I'm hoping that articulating my thoughts might give us both some closure and healing.\\" Maria looked at Victoria and nodded. She had been waiting for this moment for years, not only to hear Victoria's explanation but also to share how it had affected her. \\"You see,\\" Victoria continued, \\"during our teenage years, I became increasingly insecure about myself. My insecurities were magnified when I compared myself to you, your accomplishments, and the strong friendships you had. It was irrational, I know, but I started to tease you in a misguided attempt to assert my own worth. I never meant to hurt you, and I deeply regret my actions.\\" Maria listened intently, her heart swelling with both relief and empathy, as she realized that the teasing was a symptom of Victoria's own struggles and not Maria's shortcomings. In both scenarios, the honest and difficult conversation allowed Maria and Victoria to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and each other. Apologies were exchanged and wounds were mended. Through the newfound mutual awareness of their misunderstandings and missteps, their friendship resumed, giving them both a chance to embark on a more mature and supportive relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Here are some responses: Mark Galeassi of Kansas City, Missouri This is the best move for both parties. Yahoo has the ideas and Microsoft has the money to finally market these ideas correctly. Microsoft and Yahoo are a perfect fit and the deal will be good for consumers. Scott G of New Jersey I was a Yahoo user for years along with Hotmail from Microsoft. Then Google came along: Google Earth, Google Toolbar and Gmail. Google is so innovative   with everything they do. Yahoo and Microsoft... same old story... I don't think the merger   will do anything for either company except improve the Yahoo shareholders' bank accounts. Michael Glosser of Estero, Florida Right now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is. Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet! Antonio Simmons of Parkville, Maryland Microsoft purchasing Yahoo would be nothing more than an attempt from Microsoft to further impose upon the users their poor-quality software and obtain more wealth for the company. In my opinion, they will never be able to compete with Google because Yahoo and Microsoft's current search engines are too inferior   to compete. Even if combined, they still lack. What is Antonio Simmons' attitude towards Google? A) Doubtful. B) Disapproval. C) Positive. D) Negative.

Article: Eraser, a program recommended by security experts, installs an option in the right-click menu that allows you to securely delete (“wipe”) any file or folder with a click. You can also use Eraser to fill the space that once housed your older deleted files with brand new data. The installer will download to your default download folder (usually called “Downloads”). Double-click the Eraser installer, then accept the license agreement. Choose “Complete” as your setup type, click “Next,” and finally, “Install.” When you see a box with a Finish button, click it to complete the installation. If there are particular files on your computer that you'd like to permanently delete, press ⊞ Win+E to launch Windows File Explorer, then browse to the folder containing the files. To select multiple files or folders at once, hold down the Ctrl key as you click their names. This will wipe the files from your computer completely, bypassing the recycle bin. This can take several minutes, depending computer speed and file size. You can also delete entire folders this way. To make sure sensitive data you deleted at a previous time is completely wiped from your computer, you can completely wipe all of your previously deleted files by creating and running a new task in Eraser. Press ⊞ Win+S to launch the Windows search box, then type Eraser into the blank. When you see “Eraser” appear in the search results, click it to launch the program. Running Eraser on the drive can take several hours, depending on your computer and drive size. You can use the computer while the process runs, but it might be slow. You may want to run it overnight. Erasure methods are specific patterns that are filled in to replace the data left over from deleted files. Different methods run the patterns several times (each instance is called a “pass”) to ensure that the data is truly wiped forever. You'll need to select an option for both \\"Default file erasure method” and “Default unused space erasure method.” “US Army” and “Air Force” provide fast but effective wiping. While other options have higher passes (some up to 35 passes), 3-pass methods like 'US Army\\" and \\"Air Force\\" provide some extra insurance. Click “Save Settings” when you're done. ” Now you'll set up a task that can be run immediately. Because the files have already been deleted, select “Unused Disk Space” and choose your main hard drive from the list. Click “OK.” To ensure that Eraser runs without issue, close all open programs except for Eraser. Click on the task you just created (it should say “Unused Disk Space”) and select “Run Now.” A progress bar will appear, showing you the progress of the task. When the process is complete, the progress bar will reach 100%. At that point, the files you deleted earlier will be wiped from the hard drive.

They didn't specify whether this information has given them significant or complete knowledge about Benny. The information could be limited or incomplete. 2. The second sentence states that the speaker didn't know anything about Benny. This could refer to the speaker's knowledge before finding the information mentioned in the first sentence.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him.

A fight breaks out as the two crews change over.In another part of the installation the main office is informed that mine number 8 has filled with water. One of the engineers Shigeru Kwamura (Kenji Sahara) goes down to investigate; the last survey didnt reveal any problems. When he arrives at the shaft he discovers two of the miners are trapped by the waterShigeru calls for a couple of volunteers and they head down the tunnel to rescue the men. Yoshi is the first one found; he appears unconscious and close to death. Hes quickly rushed to the hospital and the doctors are concerned about a strange head wound they have found.There is no news about the other man, Goro. Some of the miners think Goro tried to kill Yoshi because of the earlier fight in the assembly area. Leaving the hospital Shigeru encounters his girlfriend Kiyo (Yumi Shirakawa) who is also Goro's sister. She fears the stories of his crime are true bit Shirakawa insists that she wait till more information is availableBack in the flooded tunnel the search for Goro goes on. One of the men thinks they hear something and investigate. Getting closer to the source of the noise they hear other strange sounds. Suddenly two of the men are dragged below the water but a third escapes. He tries to phone for help but is killed.Later the bodies of the three men are recovered. They seem to have suffered the same injuries as Yoshi. The doctor seems to doubt Goro could have committed the murders; the strength involved would be beyond anything he was capable of.That night Shigeru goes and comforts Kiyo as rumors spread through the village about her brother. As they sit and talk a huge caterpillar like creature crashes into the house, the couple escape and summon the police.

A:","output":"The military strategizes to destroy the Rodans in the original movie titled 'Rodan' released in 1956. After the discovery of these massive, destructive creatures, it's decided that the best course of action is to attack them in their nest, which is located in Mount Aso. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces mobilize and a plan is put into place: they would attack the Rodans in their nest via an aerial bombardment. The volcano, being the nesting place of the creatures, becomes the main target. The objective of their attack plan is to trigger an eruption which should be powerful enough to kill the creatures in their own nest. To execute the plan, multiple fighter jets are deployed, which circle around the volcano and drop missiles directly into it. The plan unfolds as expected, causing the volcano to erupt. In the events that follow, one of the Rodans gets stuck in the volcanic ash and lava, and the other, in a tragic display of emotions, chooses to join its partner in the lava rather than to escape, giving viewers a resolution. The climax effectively portrays the military strategy used to destroy the creatures and the emotional depths of the creatures themselves as being more than just monsters. This military strategy thereby not only focuses on the destruction of the Rodans but also results in an unexpected display of unity and bond between the monstrous creatures leading to a somewhat melancholic end."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Imagine a toy factory, and in this factory, there are toy-making machines, people, and a plan to make the toys. Now, a startup is like the toy factory, and it makes something people want. To make toys efficiently, people in the factory should work together, use the machines properly, and follow the plan. Similarly, a startup can achieve operational efficiency by: - Making a simple plan: Like a recipe for making cookies, a startup needs a plan to set goals and know what to do. - Teamwork: Just like playing with friends, everyone should work together and help each other to achieve the goals. - Using resources wisely: Like using only what's needed from a toy box, a startup should use money, time, and tools carefully and effectively. - Learning and improving: If the toy factory finds a better way to make toys, it should use that. A startup should always learn and get better at what it does. 2. What percentage of startups are usually stealthy out of all the operating startups? Stealthy startups are like secret clubs that don't tell everyone what they are doing. It's hard to say the exact percentage because many startups don't share their secret plan.

On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur Rochefort. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil plot thought up by Cardinal Richelieu against the king and queen of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several duels, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's soldiers. When searching for lodging in Paris, D'Artagnan meets the lovely Constance Bonacieux, a good friend of the queen.

Context: On 12 January, the Tsar appointed Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov as governor in St Petersburg and dismissed the Minister of the Interior, Pyotr Sviatopolk-Mirskii, on 18 February  1905. He appointed a government commission \\"to enquire without delay into the causes of discontent among the workers in the city of St Petersburg and its suburbs\\" in view of the strike movement. The commission was headed by Senator NV Shidlovsky, a member of the State Council, and included officials, chiefs of government factories, and private factory owners. It was also meant to have included workers' delegates elected according to a two-stage system. Elections of the workers delegates were, however, blocked by the socialists who wanted to divert the workers from the elections to the armed struggle. On 5 March  1905, the Commission was dissolved without having started work. Following the assassination of his uncle, the Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich, on 17 February  1905, the Tsar made new concessions. On 18 February  1905 he published the Bulygin Rescript, which promised the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech  and a reduction in the peasants' redemption payments. On 24 and 25 May  1905, about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives held three meetings in Moscow, which passed a resolution, asking for popular representation at the national level. On 6 June  1905, Nicholas II had received a Zemstvo deputation. Responding to speeches by Prince Sergei Trubetskoi and Mr Fyodrov, the Tsar confirmed his promise to convene an assembly of people's representatives. Question: Did the Bulygin Rescript include the repeal of voting requirements? Answer:","output":"The Bulygin Rescript, published by Tsar Nicholas II on 18 February 1905, was an important document outlining several concessions in response to the growing unrest and demand for reforms within the Russian Empire. Although the Rescript promised several key concessions, addressing issues like the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, and a reduction in peasants' redemption payments, it did not directly address the repeal of voting requirements. The Rescript mainly focused on establishing a more representative form of government through the formation of a consultative assembly, which would include elected representatives from various social classes. However, the document did not clearly outline any modifications or repeals with respect to the existing voting requirements or electoral procedures. Moreover, the Bulygin Rescript did not grant the assembly legislative powers, and as a result, it was seen as a limited and insufficient reform by many revolutionaries and reformers. The dissatisfaction with the Bulygin Rescript, among other grievances, eventually led to the October Manifesto, which was issued by Tsar Nicholas II on October 17, 1905. The October Manifesto went further than the previous Rescript and granted civil liberties, including the freedom of assembly, association, and universal suffrage, paving the way for the establishment of the Russian State Duma, a more powerful and inclusive legislative assembly. In conclusion, the Bulygin Rescript did not directly address the repeal of voting requirements. It focused on providing some concessions to the people, including the creation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, and freedom of speech, but did not delve into the specifics of electoral or voting reforms. It wasn't until the October Manifesto that significant voting and electoral changes were introduced, including universal suffrage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"The large man tried to breathe but found each breath harder and harder.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The big man had a difficult time breathing.\\"?","output":"Given the premise, \\"The large man tried to breathe but found each breath harder and harder,\\" we can analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"The big man had a difficult time breathing.\\" Entailment, in logic, is a term used to describe the relationship between two statements (the premise and the hypothesis) when the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees or necessarily implies the truth of the other statement (the hypothesis). In other words, it means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. Now, let's examine the given premise and hypothesis closely. The premise states that \\"The large man tried to breathe but found each breath harder and harder.\\" This sentence conveys the idea that a large man is attempting to breathe, but with every subsequent breath, he is experiencing increasing difficulty. The premise presents a situation where a man's ability to breathe is deteriorating, becoming steadily more challenging. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that \\"The big man had a difficult time breathing.\\" This sentence simply implies that a big (or large) man experienced difficulty breathing. While the hypothesis does not mention the progressive nature of the breathing difficulty, it does correctly assert that the man faced challenges with breathing. When comparing the two statements, we can observe that the hypothesis conveys a slightly less detailed version of the premise. Specifically, the hypothesis states that the big man had a difficult time breathing, which is also included in the premise due to the nature of increasingly challenging breaths. It is important to note that both the premise and hypothesis refer to the same subject (a large or big man) who experiences difficulty breathing. Given the provided premise, it is clear that the large man is having difficulty breathing. In this case, the hypothesis that \\"The big man had a difficult time breathing\\" is in alignment with the fact presented in the premise. If the premise is true, it directly implies that the hypothesis is also true, as the progressively worsening breathing mentioned in the premise encapsulates and includes the situation of a man having difficulty breathing. Thus, based on the provided information, the premise – \\"The large man tried to breathe but found each breath harder and harder\\" – does entail the hypothesis \\"The big man had a difficult time breathing.\\" In other words, if the premise is accurate and true, then it is guaranteed that the hypothesis is also true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, the reviewer points out that the movie is \\"worth buying,\\" indicating that they believe it holds enough value and entertainment to justify its purchase.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the supporting band member who recalled a show by the band where \\"we had like three feet of room\\"?  Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

Write an article based on this summary: Plans to replace four primary schools with two new ones have been backed by Powys council.","output":"Title: Powys Council Supports Transformation of Four Primary Schools into Two State-of-the-Art Institutions Introduction The Powys County Council has recently announced its endorsement for an ambitious plan to consolidate four primary schools into two brand new, modern educational facilities. This initiative comes as an effort to deliver enhanced learning experiences to students while utilising financial and infrastructural resources more efficiently. In this article, we discuss the transformative plan's details, its potential impact on the Powys educational landscape, anticipated benefits for students and faculty, and the expected timeline for completion. Revolutionising Education in Powys The Powys council's decision to replace four primary schools with two new ones marks a crucial step toward modernising education within the region. Recognising the need for educational institutions to evolve in accordance with 21st-century learning requirements, the council aims to provide students with innovative and technologically-advanced learning environments. Though the precise locations for the two new schools have not been finalised, they will be strategically located to cater to the needs of the four existing schools' communities. The new schools will replace the existing primary schools in a phased manner, ensuring a smooth transition for all students and staff. Cutting-Edge Facilities and Enhanced Learning Experiences The newly-built schools are expected to feature state-of-the-art facilities, including spacious classrooms equipped with interactive whiteboards, multimedia tools, and modern furniture designed for flexibility and comfort. Additionally, these new premises will house state-of-the-art science and computer labs, well-resourced libraries, sports facilities, and outdoor learning areas. Extra-curricular activities will be given greater prominence, fostering a more holistic approach to student development. By replacing the four primary schools with two new-age educational centres, Powys Council aims to provide educators with the tools and resources required to deliver engaging, effective and interactive lessons, ultimately helping students to develop a solid academic foundation. Efficient Utilisation of Resources The Powys Council recognises the fiscal and logistical challenges that encompass maintaining multiple schools. By streamlining the educational landscape and replacing the four primary schools with two larger establishments, the council aims to generate considerable savings on maintenance and operational expenses. In addition to the efficient use of funds, there will be an opportunity to pool resources, knowledge, and experiences to provide an enriched learning experience. Implications for Students and Faculty The primary beneficiaries of this council-backed transformation will be students who will have access to better educational experiences, resources and infrastructure. However, the consolidation process will require a detailed review of staffing requirements for the newly formed schools. The council will work closely with faculty members to provide any necessary professional development, ensuring they are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in a modern educational environment. Timeline and Next Steps While the exact timeline for the completion and opening of the two new schools is yet to be confirmed, detailed plans have commenced and relevant stakeholders will be consulted throughout the process. This includes engaging local communities, discussing potential locations, and seeking relevant permissions and approvals from appropriate authorities. The Powys council will maintain open communication with all involved parties, and further updates will be provided as the project progresses. Conclusion The Powys County Council's support for replacing four primary schools with two new institutions highlights the region's commitment to modernising education and providing children with the best possible opportunities for academic success and personal growth. By consolidating resources, embracing innovative learning methods, and creating optimised facilities, this transformative plan sets the stage for a bright and promising future for education in Powys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rubber Band - A rubber band is a type of band that usually refers to an elastic loop, and it does not make sense in the context of the question. 2. Annoy Mom - This seems to be more of a joke or informal term for a band name, and it does not provide any clear indication of what kind of band this would be. 3. Brass Band - This type of band typically features brass instruments and may include a variety of genres, but they are less likely to play at clubs as their main performance venue. 4. Marching Band - This type of band is usually associated with outdoor performances, parades, and sporting events, not clubs. Marching bands are also more structured, and the initial description implies the band John plays in has a diverse group of people and instruments, which does not usually fit the profile of a marching band. 5. Jazz Band - Jazz bands play a wide variety of instruments and have diverse members, which aligns with the information about John's band. Additionally, jazz bands are most likely to play at clubs as one of their primary performance venues. Considering all of the above factors, I agree that the correct choice is \\"jazz band\\" because it aligns best with the description of the band that John plays in, mainly diverse members, various instruments, and the fact that they mostly play at clubs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I prefer the old cell phones compared to new cell phones because the  Choices: i. new cell phones are less prone to defects.. ii. old cell phones are less prone to defects..","output":"old cell phones are less prone to defects. There are several reasons that contribute to my preference, and I will discuss them step-by-step to demonstrate why I believe this is the case. Step 1: Consider the build quality and durability One of the primary reasons that old cell phones appear to be less prone to defects is their build quality and durability. Many older models were built with robust materials that can withstand drops, scrapes, and general wear and tear. On the other hand, new cell phones are often slimmer and feature delicate designs with materials like glass and aluminum which can be more prone to damage. Step 2: Analyze the simplicity in design and function Old cell phones were generally designed with simplicity in mind, both in aesthetics and functionality. This simplicity often led to fewer elements that could break or malfunction. With fewer components to potentially fail, the old cell phones had a lower chance of developing defects. In contrast, new cell phones have become increasingly complex, with multiple cameras, sensors, and software features that can lead to more potential points of failure. Step 3: Evaluate the development of software and updates Compared to new cell phones, old cell phones had less frequent software updates, which could be considered both a limitation and an advantage. While new cell phones receive frequent updates that can bring new features or improvements, these updates can also introduce new bugs and defects. In a way, the infrequency of updates on old cell phones may have contributed to their relative stability. By considering these points, it's clear that there are various factors that contribute to the perception that old cell phones are less prone to defects compared to new cell phones. While there may be some truth to this perception, it is important to recognize that each generation of cell phones has its own unique features and challenges. As technology continues to evolve, manufacturers will need to balance design innovation with durability and reliability to ensure that consumers have a positive experience with their devices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this May 4, 2014 file photo, an Etihad Airways plane prepares to land at the Abu Dhabi airport in the United Arab Emirates. A U.S. official tells The Associated Press that the ban beginning... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. and Britain, citing concerns about terrorist attacks, are not allowing passengers on some flights from mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries to bring laptops, tablets and certain other devices on board with them in their carry-on bags. All electronics bigger than a smartphone must be checked in.      Here are some questions and answers on the ban:      ___      WHICH FLIGHTS AND AIRPORTS DOES THIS AFFECT?      The U.S. ban applies to nonstop U.S.-bound flights from 10 international airports in Amman, Jordan; Kuwait City, Kuwait; Cairo; Istanbul; Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. About 50 flights a day, all on foreign airlines, are affected.      The British rules apply to flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.      ___      WHY ARE THESE COUNTRIES AND AIRPORTS SINGLED OUT?      U.S. officials say the decision was prompted by intelligence about potential threats to planes bound for the U.S. They are giving no details, such as whether a particular terror group prompted the ban.      ___      WHY DOES THIS AFFECT ONLY NONSTOP FLIGHTS, NOT THOSE WITH STOPOVERS?      Flights with stopovers on the way to the U.S. are met with additional security checks and screenings, adding an additional layer of protection. Bennet Waters of the Chertoff Group, a security consulting firm, says the affected airports may have been singled out by the government because of the procedures and equipment they use to screen carry-on bags.      ___      WHY ARE LAPTOPS AND TABLETS CONSIDERED MORE DANGEROUS THAN CELLPHONES?      The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has not explained. But Waters says TSA and intelligence officials have probably concluded that cellphones are too small to be rigged with enough explosives to bring down an airliner.      ___      HAVE LAPTOPS OR ELECTRONICS EVER BEEN USED TO ATTACK PLANES?      Bombs concealed in electronics have been an airline safety concern for decades. In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, by a bomb hidden inside a Toshiba cassette recorder and packed inside a checked suitcase in the cargo hold. All 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground were killed. More recently, a Daallo Airlines plane landed safely in Somalia last year after a bomb inside a laptop exploded in the passenger cabin and blew a hole in the fuselage. Only the suspected suicide bomber was killed.      ___      COULDN'T A LAPTOP WITH A BOMB INSIDE STILL POSE A DANGER WITHIN THE CARGO HOLD?      Yes. A bomb inside the cargo hold could bring a plane down, airline security experts say. But they say the scanning technology used to screen checked luggage for bombs is generally more sophisticated than the X-ray machinery used to examine carry-on luggage.      Also, separating the bomb from the bomber could make it harder to detonate it in the air. A timer would be less reliable, because it could go off on the ground if there were a flight delay, says Jeffrey Price, an aviation security expert and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. And a bomb with a barometric pressure switch that would detonate at a certain altitude could be set off by rough handling at the airport, Price says.      ___      SHOULD TRAVELERS BE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR ELECTRONICS GETTING STOLEN FROM THEIR CHECKED LUGGAGE?      Yes, thieves are known to target expensive electronic equipment. Cheap luggage locks can be broken and canvas baggage can be cut into, says Anthony Roman, president of Roman & Associates, a risk management firm. He recommends using hard-shell suitcases that come with strong locks.      ___      Associated Press writer Alicia Caldwell in Washington contributed to this story. Kerr reported from Washington. ||||| Image caption The UK ban applies to direct inbound flights from six countries; the US ban lists eight countries      An aircraft cabin ban on large electronic devices was prompted by intelligence suggesting a terror threat to US-bound flights, say US media.      The US and UK have announced new carry-on restrictions banning laptops on certain passenger flights.      The so-called Islamic State group (IS) has been working on ways to smuggle explosives on to planes by hiding them in electronics, US sources tell ABC.      The tip-off was judged by the US to be \\"substantiated\\" and \\"credible\\".      Inbound flights on nine airlines operating out of 10 airports in eight countries are subject to the US Department of Homeland Security ban.      Phones and medical devices are not affected.      US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is hosting a two-day meeting of ministers and senior officials from 68 nations to discuss the threat from IS.      The Washington talks will be the first full meeting of the coalition since December 2014.      What is the meeting about? By Barbara Plett-Usher, US State Department correspondent      This will be a chance for the Trump administration to put its stamp on the global battle against the Islamic State group, and for the reticent secretary of state to put his stamp on a foreign policy issue that the president has identified as a priority.      The State Department says the meeting aims to accelerate efforts to defeat IS in its remaining strongholds: the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa.      On the campaign trail Mr Trump claimed to have a secret plan to obliterate the group. But his Pentagon has largely stuck with Barack Obama's strategy of supporting local ground forces, albeit with increased US military participation as the assault on Raqqa nears.      Coalition members will also discuss how to stabilise and govern the cities after the conflict; and they're looking to see if Washington remains committed to a longer term effort to secure the region.      UK flight ban on devices announced      Easyjet introduces laptop ban      What do we know of the threat?      Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News there was \\"a new aviation threat\\".      \\"We know that our adversaries, terrorist groups in the United States and outside the United States, seek to bring down a US-bound airliner. That's one of their highest value targets.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning      How does it affect me?      The US rule is broad and wide-ranging, affecting almost any device that is not a phone. Anything larger will have to go in checked luggage in the hold.      The advice does not define that size with any measurements. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave a list of examples, but said it was not exhaustive: laptops, tablets, e-readers, cameras, portable DVD players, electronic game units larger than a smartphone, and travel printers/scanners.      The UK has offered clearer parameters: nothing bigger than 16cm (6.3ins) long, 9.3cm (3.6ins) wide or 1.5cm (0.6ins) deep will be allowed into the cabin - which means mobiles like the larger iPhone Plus will still be allowed.

The nine airlines covered by the US ban are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways.      The British ban, announced hours after the American measure, is similar but applies to different airlines, including British Airways and Easyjet.      It covers direct passenger flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.      On Wednesday, Easyjet passengers from Turkey and Egypt bound for the UK were already told to put large electronic devices in the hold.      The airline said passengers would face extra security checks and advised them to arrive early at the airport.      The 10 airports affected by the US ban are:      Mohammed V International, Casablanca, Morocco Ataturk Airport, Istanbul, Turkey Cairo International Airport, Egypt Queen Alia International, Amman, Jordan King Abdulaziz International, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia King Khalid International, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Kuwait International Airport Hamad International, Doha, Qatar Abu Dhabi International, United Arab Emirates Dubai International, United Arab Emirates      The airlines included in the US decision have been given a deadline of 07:00 GMT on Saturday to impose the ban, officials said, adding that the restriction had no end date.      However, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters news agency the airline understood that the US directive would come into effect on 25 March and remain valid until 14 October 2017. ||||| New aviation security measures restricting electronic devices on flights from certain overseas airports were prompted by new threat intelligence obtained earlier this year indicating that ISIS associates were working on smuggling explosives-laden electronics onto U.S.-bound flights, ABC News has learned.

Here's what you need to know. (Monica Akhtar,Dani Player/The Washington Post)      From Tuesday on, passengers traveling to the U.S. from 10 airports in eight Muslim-majority countries will not be allowed to have iPads, laptops or any communications device larger than a smartphone in the cabin of the plane. If you are traveling from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, or the UAE on Egypt Air, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, or Turkish Airlines, and you want to use your laptop on the flight, you are probably out of luck.      [U.S. unveils new restrictions on travelers from eight Muslim-majority countries]      The nations affected by President Trump's executive action on immigration are not actually countries where terrorists who have carried out fatal attacks the United States came from. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)      So why is the United States doing this, and how can it get away with it?      The U.S. says it’s all about security      The Trump administration says the new rules were introduced because of intelligence that shows terrorists are continuing to target airlines flying to the United States. An unidentified person familiar with the issue has told The Washington Post that officials have long been worried by a Syrian terrorist group that is trying to build bombs inside electronic devices that are hard to detect.      However, as Demitri Sevastopulo and Robert Wright at the Financial Times suggest, non-U. S. observers are skeptical of this explanation. They note that the United States has not been forthcoming about whether the ban is based on recent intelligence or long-standing concerns. There is also no explanation for why electronic devices in the cabin are a concern, and electronic devices in the baggage hold are not.      There is an alternative explanation      It may not be about security. Three of the airlines that have been targeted for these measures — Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways — have long been accused by their U.S. competitors of receiving massive effective subsidies from their governments. These airlines have been quietly worried for months that President Trump was going to retaliate. This may be the retaliation.      These three airlines, as well as the other airlines targeted in the order, are likely to lose a major amount of business from their most lucrative customers — people who travel in business class and first class. Business travelers are disproportionately likely to want to work on the plane — the reason they are prepared to pay business-class or first-class fares is because it allows them to work in comfort. These travelers are unlikely to appreciate having to do all their work on smartphones, or not being able to work at all. The likely result is that many of them will stop flying on Gulf airlines, and start traveling on U.S. airlines instead.      As the Financial Times notes, the order doesn’t affect only the airlines’ direct flights to and from the United States — it attacks the “hub” airports that are at the core of their business models. These airlines not only fly passengers directly from the Gulf region to the United States — they also fly passengers from many other destinations, transferring them from one plane to another in the hubs. This “hub and spoke” approach is a standard economic model for long-haul airlines, offering them large savings. However, it also creates big vulnerabilities. If competitors or unfriendly states can undermine or degrade the hub, they can inflict heavy economic damage.      The United States is weaponizing interdependence      As we have argued in the past, and talk about in forthcoming work, this can be understood as a variant form of “weaponized interdependence.” We live in an interdependent world, where global networks span across countries, creating enormous benefits, but also great disparities of power. As networks grow, they tend to concentrate both influence and vulnerability in a few key locations, creating enormous opportunities for states, regulators and nonstate actors who have leverage over those locations.      [Here’s how Washington weaponized America’s IT companies and why it backfired]      In this context, the United States is plausibly leveraging its control over access to U.S. airports, which are central “nodes” in the global network of air travel between different destinations. It is using this control to attack the key vulnerabilities of other networked actors, by going after the central nodes in their networks (the hub airports) and potentially severely damaging them.      There may not be much that Gulf airline carriers can do      Gulf airlines have tried to defend themselves against political attacks from U.S. competitors by appealing to free trade principles. The problem is that standard free trade agreements, such as World Trade Organization rules, don’t really apply to airlines (although they do apply to related sectors, such as the manufacture of airplanes). This has allowed the Gulf airlines to enjoy massive subsidies, without having to worry too much about being sued in the WTO. However, it also makes it hard for Gulf states or the states of other affected airlines to take a WTO case against the new U.S. rules, even if these rules turn out to be motivated by protectionism and the desire to retaliate, rather than real underlying security questions.      If this were happening in a different sector, it would make for a pretty interesting case. States preserve carve-outs from international trade rules when they feel that their security is at stake. Would the United States prevail in a case like this, where there is a colorable security justification, but where there is also a very plausible argument that the real motivation doesn’t have much to do with security? Or would the WTO defer to the United States’ proposed justification? It’s very likely that the Trump administration will make more unilateral rules that are justified using the language of national security, but are plausibly motivated by protectionism, so we may find out. ||||| Holding many large devices with lithium-ion batteries in cargo could create fire risk that has downed airplanes, as directive only affects foreign-owned carriers      A new measure forcing passengers to store all their large electronics in the hold may have disastrous consequences, say airline experts – and the only security that measure will provide is financial security to American carriers.      Experts criticize US electronic devices ban on some flights from Middle East Read more      The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretly sent 10 foreign-owned carriers an “emergency amendment” via the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Monday, requiring flights inbound to the US from 10 Middle Eastern airports to ban any device larger than a cellphone from carry-on luggage. On Tuesday, the UK announced it was going even further than the US , banning in-cabin electronics on all direct flights from six Middle Eastern countries.      Travelers have been told that they will have to pack such devices in baggage to be checked into the plane’s hold.      But filling the hold of a commercial airliner with the lithium-ion batteries used to power most consumer electronics would create a hazard all its own, according to Robert W Mann Jr, president of the airline industry analysts RW Mann & Company.      Rechargeable batteries are often recalled because they pose a risk of fire – and the kind of fire started by an overheating battery is much harder to extinguish by conventional means.      Battery fires are believed to have downed airplanes in the past, notably a UPS flight out of Dubai which crashed in 2008 with the loss of two crew members. The general civil aviation authority of the UAE blamed the loss of the plane on combustion of batteries in the hold.      Fire suppression systems in the hold of a commercial aircraft – which is inaccessible to the crew during flight – are ineffective against metal fires, and the new regulations may actually increase the risk of fire, said Mann.            In an age of exploding tablets, safe battery storage deeply concerns experts. “On an aircraft, how many [now-prohibited] devices are carried by, let’s say, 300 customers? How many spare batteries? How many batteries charged by unapproved chargers are in the hold?” Mann asked. “It would be harder to detect that and harder to fight an in-flight fire in the hold than it would if a fire occurred in the cabin. Most cabins have fire blankets and extinguishers that are useful against metal fires.”      Fires in jetliner holds are extinguished automatically by halon-gas extinguishers, which are effective only against open flame and useless against overheating metal, according to a report by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).      In 2014, the ICAO’s dangerous goods panel issued a report on lithium-ion batteries – the kind of rechargeable batteries most commonly used in portable electronics like laptops, tablets and gaming devices, all of which are affected by the new rule. “[F]ires in flight involving certain types and quantities of lithium metal batteries have the potential to result in an uncontrolled fire leading to a catastrophic failure of the airframe,” the ICAO report said.      The United Nations and the US’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) agreed, voting to ban cargo shipments of lithium-ion batteries from passenger jets on the grounds of unacceptable risk. The FAA issued a warning of “catastrophic hull loss due to significant identified dangers associated with the transport of lithium batteries as cargo”.      Mann said that the primary risk of cargo shipments of batteries is posed by the density with which those batteries are packed on a shipping pallet.      Other luggage would probably provide some insulation in the event of a fire in the baggage bins, and many people already check their laptops, but radically increasing the number of batteries in various states of repair in the inaccessible cargo area inevitably increases risk.            DHS also ignores its own precautionary measures with the new rule: Abu Dhabi, one of the affected airports, operates what Mann calls “a state-of-the-art US customs and border preclearance facility” so rigorous that passengers inbound to the US from that airport are cleared by US customs and treated as domestic travelers when they land.            “It’s kind of bizarre that this state-of-the-art facility is judged inadequate to screen electronics. That seems like the primary objective of one these facilities,” said Mann.      Forcing passengers to toss their batteries into the hold poses other problems. “Many of the customers who are inconvenienced by this in the short term won’t have battery endcaps or battery bags to inert them from short-circuiting,” Mann said.      Instead, the regulation will probably simply hurt foreign-owned carriers and drive customers to US carriers in the name of security.      “It seems to create a competitive disadvantage for those carriers flying nonstop from those 10 points,” Mann said. So far, DHS has punted responsibility for implementing the rule to the FAA. The FAA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.      All of the airlines affected by the US ban are foreign. The only foreign carrier not affected is Israel’s El Al, which shares its fleet with American Airlines. “A number of parties [among US carriers] have been calling for a reset on some of the Middle East aviation agreements,” Mann said. US carriers contend that state-owned luxury airlines – several of which are affected by the ban – compete unfairly with American carriers, which have reduced passenger amenities steadily for years.      “It will have a competitive effect whether or not that’s the intended result,” Mann said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The US and the UK have banned passengers on flights from some countries in the Middle East and North Africa from carrying laptops, tablets, and other large electronic devices on board.

Article: Where are Chinese tourists going next? Pop culture may hold some clues, from a successful movie Finding Mr. Right to U.S. situation comedy The Big Bang Theory. China is the source of most of the world's tourists as well as its biggest-spending travelers. In 2012 alone, 83 million Chinese went abroad and spent a huge 102 billion, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Now more than ever, popular culture is driving their decision making. Below are a few examples of how TV shows and hit movies are influencing Chinese tourists' travel choices. SEATTLE Over the past two years, Seattle -- that rainy city in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. -- has seen a 90% rise in visitor numbers from China, local officials say. The reason: the huge popularity of the Chinese romantic comedy Finding Mr. Right, in which a woman from mainland China travels to Seattle to give birth. Directed by Xue Xiaolu and starring Tang Wei, the film has earned more than 85 million in China since its release last year. (The movie's Chinese title translates literally to Beijing meets Seattle.) LOS ANGELES Los Angeles has long been a favorite: destination for Chinese tourists visiting the U.S. but lately, they've been asking for detours to nearby Pasadena to pay respect to their favorite The Big Bang Theory. Fans are requesting visits to places including the campus of California Institute of Technology as well as a particular Cheesecake Factory outlet, which both figure prominently  in the CBS situation comedy that Chinese fans stream online. EUROPE AND THE U.S. The U.S., U.K., France and Germany remain the most frequented destinations for Chinese who travel to the West, but the sights they flock  to within those countries often are unique to Chinese culture. For instance, Karl Marx's birthplace in Trier, Germany, has long been a pilgrimage spot, while a willow tree in Cambridge, England, is a must-visit for bus tourists because of a well-known poem by Xu Zhimo, who studied at the city's famous...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: But eyewitnesses noticed a number of aberrations. Some told local press that the police who arrived at the crime scene collected bullet casings and other evidence and then washed the area down to clean away the blood stains. One of the  injured was taken to a nearby house, witnesses said.  Later, the injured man - or was he dead by then? - was put in a vehicle and driven away in the presence of senior police officers. Local police registered a report saying unknown assailants on a motorbike injured a naan-bread maker at a suburban market. When confronted by the reporters, they denied there had been a second injured man. The capital's main hospitals also reported only one casualty from the scene - one Mohammad Farooq, the naan maker. But by mid-afternoon on Monday rumours were swirling that the second mystery man hit in the attack was in fact Nasiruddin Haqqani, a key leader of the so-called Haqqani network, considered one of the deadliest Afghan Taliban groups fighting Western forces in Afghanistan. Confirming the rumours, a relative of Mr Haqqani told BBC his body had been spirited from Islamabad to the town of Miranshah in North Waziristan - roughly six hours drive across two provinces and one federal tribal territory, all dotted with heavily-manned military and police checkpoints. There are obvious reasons for this cover-up. For years, Pakistan has been accused by the West of backing the Haqqani network to counter the influence of arch-rival India in Afghanistan, a charge it denies. So the idea that some of the group's key leaders were freely moving around in Islamabad - and even had a permanent home in the city, as has become apparent following the attack - could cause the country some embarrassment, a reminder of what it faced in 2011 when al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by the Americans in a Pakistani city. Nasiruddin was the son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviets in the 1980s who then set up the Haqqani network to fight the Americans in the post-9/11 era. He was also the elder brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Haqqani network these days. The Haqqanis belong to the Jadran tribe which is a native of eastern Afghanistan's Loya, or greater, Paktia region, and pledge allegiance to the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. But they have their main sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal territory of Waziristan and maintain operational independence from the Afghan Taliban. The group is known for launching spectacular attacks against Western and Indian targets in Afghanistan. And it is known to have played a prominent role in seeking to bring the anti-Pakistan militant groups in the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) alliance to the dialogue table with Islamabad. Nasiruddin Haqqani was not central to the group's military operations, but had a vital role as a fundraiser and emissary who frequently travelled to the sheikhdoms of the Middle East to raise cash, and also, according to some reports, to look after his family business there. He also played a part in last year's efforts to set up a Taliban office in Doha for peace talks with the United States, although the Haqqani network was not a direct interlocutor in those talks. In addition, he was understood to be the group's main contact person for pro-Taliban elements in Pakistan, and was frequently seen moving around in Islamabad. According to local residents, some family members of Nasiruddin Haqqani had been living in the Shahpur area on Islamabad's eastern outskirts for well over four years. He was apparently using this base to organise financial and logistical support for his group and the Afghan Taliban. So there were a number of groups who could have wanted to see him dead. Analysts believe his assassination has dealt a blow to the group's fundraising activities, because they think Nasiruddin was the only Haqqani free to exploit his father's vast Middle Eastern contacts. The others are either dead, or engaged in operational matters. Some quarters also suggest he was Islamabad's main link to the TTP leadership in its recent peace overtures to that group. For these circles, the obvious suspects behind his killing would be either the Americans or the Afghans. But others point to growing unease within the wider Taliban community in the North Waziristan sanctuary as the time for Nato's drawdown in Afghanistan gets nearer. This unease is partly due to a fluid situation in Pakistan, where the political and military establishments are putting up a half-hearted battle against some right-wing politicians who appear bent on exploiting the anti-American feelings in the country to push it into international isolation. Tribal sources say there is a clear split within the TTP, with some ethnic Mehsud commanders accusing the Haqqanis of toeing the Pakistani line. The Haqqanis have also faced opposition from some Punjabi Taliban groups that were initially hosted and feted by them but have now sunk their own roots in the area and consider the Haqqanis to be as foreign to Waziristan as they are themselves. Analysts feel 10 years after it was created, the Waziristan sanctuary is readying for change, with dozens of groups realigning amid shifts in relations and tactical priorities concerning Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. For a while, there may be no clear friends or enemies in the area, they say.","output":"Eyewitnesses reported police anomalies at the scene of a crime where Nasiruddin Haqqani, a key leader of the Haqqani network, was rumored to be killed. Police denied the presence of a second injured man besides Mohammad Farooq, the naan maker. Hospitals also reported only one casualty. Pakistan has been accused of supporting the Haqqani network in the past, making the presence of its leaders in Islamabad an embarrassment. Nasiruddin was known for fundraising and maintaining Middle Eastern contacts, leading to speculation that his death could hurt the group's financial activities. Possible culprits behind his killing include the Americans, Afghans, or growing internal tensions within the wider Taliban community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Options: - They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost   - not enough information   - They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits   - They believe there were no changes === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"- They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Problem:Question: How long had Tommy Allen play for Southampton before he turned down the contract? Passage 1:In late April 2016, Travis began taking part in extended spring training games. He was assigned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays for rehab on May 13. On May 18, he was promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons to continue rehabbing. On May 25, Travis was activated off the disabled list by the Blue Jays and called up. He hit a walk-off infield single on May 28 to help the Blue Jays defeat the Boston Red Sox 10–9. On August 5, Travis hit two home runs in a game for the first time in his career. Leading off against the Kansas City Royals, Travis hit a solo home run to give the Blue Jays an early 1–0 lead. In the ninth inning, he hit another solo home run off Kelvin Herrera to lift Toronto to a 4–3 victory. On August 8, Travis hit his first career triple, which came as part of a four-hit game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Following a game on August 31, the Blue Jays optioned Travis to the Rookie-Advanced Bluefield Blue Jays. The move was made to allow Josh Thole to be re-signed and have postseason eligibility. As the Bluefield season would end on September 1, Travis could be immediately recalled by Toronto afterward, bypassing the ten-day waiting period. Travis was recalled by the Blue Jays on September 2. He finished the season hitting .300 with 11 home runs and 50 RBI in 101 games. Travis played in the Wild Card Game and the first game of the American League Division Series, but missed the remainder of the ALDS with a bone bruise in his right knee. He played in the first game of the Championship Series, but left in the fifth inning after reaggravating his knee injury. On October 15, Travis was removed from the ALCS roster due to injury, and replaced by Justin Smoak. In accordance with MLB rules, Travis was ruled ineligible to return for the postseason, ending his season. On November 18, he underwent right knee surgery to remove a small flap of cartilage, and was expected to be ready for spring training.  Passage 2:The Royal Mint is a government-owned mint that produces coins for the United Kingdom. Operating under the name Royal Mint Ltd, the mint is a limited company that is wholly owned by Her Majesty's Treasury and is under an exclusive contract to supply all the nation's coinage. As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally, the mint also produces planchets, commemorative coins, various types of medals and precious metal bullion. The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year, making up 70% of its total sales. Formed over 1,100 years ago, the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England, all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire. The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s. As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency, the Mint moved from London to a new plant in Llantrisant, Wales where it has remained since.  Passage 3:One of the later signings of the summer was goalkeeper Len Hill, who joined from Queens Park Rangers in June 1925. Regular keeper Tommy Allen had turned down a new contract at the club, leading to the signing of Hill as his replacement. Allen later agreed to new terms in October and returned to his place as first-choice Southampton goalkeeper, with Hill making sporadic appearances later in the season. Transfer activity continued throughout the season. In December 1925 the club signed inside-forward Jim Swinden from Salisbury City, following a trial in which he scored two goals on his debut for the reserve side against Folkestone. In March 1926, right-half Bill Adams joined from Southern League side Guildford United. Needing money to purchase the freehold of The Dell, Southampton sold mainstay full-backs Fred Titmuss and Tom Parker in early 1926 – the former in February to Plymouth Argyle for £1,750; the latter in March to Arsenal for £3,250 – which \\"caused uproar amongst supporters\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.  Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.  In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.  However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket. How did the war affect his private life?","output":"The Second World War had a significant impact on Sir Donald Bradman's private life as well as his professional career. During the war years, Bradman experienced multiple setbacks in different aspects of his life. In terms of his health, the war exacerbated his chronic muscular problems, which were diagnosed as fibrositis. The physical demands of his posting with the Australian Army greatly aggravated his condition, causing him excruciating pain, to the point where he was unable to perform simple tasks such as shaving or combing his hair. Charles Williams, in his biography of Bradman, suggests that the physical problems may have been psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression. Moreover, the war exposed Bradman's poor eyesight, which was surprising given his incredible batting prowess. Consequently, he was invalided out of the service in June 1941 and spent months recuperating. Bradman's professional life was also negatively impacted by the war. One of the consequences was his financial struggle due to the collapse of the stockbroking firm he was working for, Harry Hodgetts. The firm's downfall resulted from fraud and embezzlement in 1945, which forced Bradman to establish his own business, using Hodgetts' client list and office space. Despite recovering and setting up his business successfully, the scandal left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in Adelaide's business community for years to come. On a positive note, during the war, Bradman became more involved in the administration of cricket in Australia. He was appointed as a delegate to the Board of Control by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) and played a significant role in planning for post-war cricket. This involvement helped him to transition back into the cricketing world after the war, and he went on to resume his role as a Test selector.  Overall, the war had considerable effects on Sir Donald Bradman's private life, encompassing physical and emotional challenges, financial turmoil, and the subsequent shift in his career path. Despite all these obstacles, he remained involved in the sport he loved and continued to contribute to cricket, both on and off the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who is the only 20th century president to be carved onto Mount Rushmore?","output":"The only 20th century president to be carved onto Mount Rushmore is Theodore Roosevelt. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. The monument features the heads of four significant United States presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln—each chosen because they respective roles in the country's establishment, development, and preservation. The sculptor behind this mammoth project was Gutzon Borglum. The work began in 1927, and it took 14 years to complete, with occasional interruptions caused by weather and financial issues. Completed in 1941, Borglum died a few months before the work was declared finished. Theodore Roosevelt, the only 20th-century president on Mount Rushmore, had a considerable impact on the United States, serving as the 26th president from 1901 to 1909. He was chosen by Borglum due to his significant contributions to the development of the country. Some notable achievements during his presidency include promoting progressive policies that championed labor rights, consumer protection, and natural resource conservation. He was instrumental in the construction of the Panama Canal and was an advocate of the U.S.'s emergence as a major world power. Roosevelt's passion for conservation led to the establishment of five national parks and 18 national monuments, along with 150 national forests, setting aside over 230 million acres of public land for the generations to come. This strong commitment to conservation is one reason why he was ideal for inclusion alongside the other three remarkable American presidents on the iconic Mount Rushmore monument."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes, which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia. The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton. Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth). What releases sperm from annelids?","output":"Annelids release sperm from their nephridia, which are excretory organs that help in the expulsion of both sperm and ova into the water for external fertilization."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Alps: During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as Les Menuires. Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors. From 1980 to the present, ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts, leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline.

Would \\"The female figures Liberty and Ceres , representative of the state's motto (see next item).\\" be a reasonable answer?","output":"Yes, your description of the New Jersey flag is accurate, but I will provide a more detailed answer for better understanding. The flag of New Jersey, known as the \\"State Banner\\" or \\"State Flag of New Jersey,\\" consists of the official state seal placed on a buff-colored background. The New Jersey state motto, “Liberty and Prosperity,” is also a part of the flag.  The state seal, designed by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1777 and officially adopted in the same year, has diverse symbols representing the values and history of the state. The main elements of the seal are: 1. The female figures Liberty and Ceres: Liberty, holding a staff with the liberty cap on top, is a representation of political freedom. Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, holding a cornucopia filled with harvested produce, signifies abundance and agricultural prosperity. These two figures not only represent the state's motto but also underscore the importance of freedom and agricultural wealth to New Jersey. 2. The blue shield with three plows: Located in the center of the seal, the blue shield symbolizes the state's commitment to governance and the significance of agriculture, as the three plows depict New Jersey's agricultural heritage. The state's long tradition of farming is an essential aspect of its prosperity. 3. The horse's head and the knight's helmet: Above the shield, there is a horse's head and a forward-facing knight's helmet. The horse, which is the official state animal, represents speed, strength, and resilience. The knight's helmet symbolizes the state's sovereignty, dignity, and protection. 4. The scroll with the state motto \\"Liberty and Prosperity\\": The state motto, inscribed on the scroll at the bottom of the state seal, refers to the fundamental principles upon which New Jersey was founded. The phrase is also a reflection of the hopes and aspirations of its citizens. In summary, the New Jersey flag features the state seal on a buff-colored background, and its primary elements - the female figures Liberty and Ceres, the blue shield with three plows, the horse's head and knight's helmet, and the scroll with the state motto - exemplify the essential values and the rich history of the state.

Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a mixture of both negative and positive sentiments, making it difficult to classify definitively. Initially, the review expresses a negative sentiment by stating that the book was \\"ok but not great,\\" suggesting some dissatisfaction or disappointment with the book. Furthermore, the mention of \\"no pictures sad\\" may indicate that the reviewer found the book's lack of illustrations disappointing, further emphasizing a negative sentiment. However, the reviewer quickly changes their tone and humorously states that they were \\"JUST KIDDING,\\" which might be taken as a shift to a more positive sentiment, or simply as a playful and perhaps sarcastic remark. The reference to a YouTube video, \\"cenafan363 Weapons for dummies,\\" could be seen as an attempt to divert the reader's attention away from the initial negative remarks and direct them towards something that the reviewer might find more enjoyable or entertaining, thus suggesting a more positive sentiment about the content they are recommending. In this context, the reviewer might be suggesting that the book is better than they initially described it to be, or that the YouTube content is somehow related to the book in terms of subject matter or quality.

It only took three minutes for this match when Forrest buried the rebound after Gary Harkins forced a save from Dumbarton goalkeeper Alan Martin. Harkins was again instrumental in the second goal, teeing up Forrest for an easy finish. And Forrest made it three from the penalty spot. Harkins could have had one himself; driving the ball towards goal from distance, but there was too much on the strike and it flew over the bar. Dumbarton finally showed up in the 18th minute. Greg Fleming had to punch clear in the Ayr goal, it then fell to Josh Todd, but his shot from 20 yards took a deflection on its way over. There were calls for a penalty by the United camp before the end of the first half, but it looked as though Mark Docherty timed his challenge on Nicky Devlin as he burst into the area. It was another early goal in the second half and another gift from Dumbarton. Alan Martin lost out to Harkins in the box, the keeper committed and lost, then Harkins squared to Forrest who couldn't miss for his second. Ayr wrapped up the points from the penalty spot when Devlin was brought down in the box by Daniel Harvie, and Forrest stepped up and secured his hat-trick.

Question: What is wrong with John's son? Movie title: John Q Movie plot: A woman is driving dangerously down a winding road, recklessly passing cars until she comes upon a slow moving Mack truck. As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off. Meanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for. One of them, Miriam, is pregnant, and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy. A young hostage, Julie, has a broken arm, and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it. Due to holes in their story, John and another hostage, Lester, conclude the two are lying and... Answer:","output":"In the movie John Q, John Quincy Archibald's son, Michael, is suffering from an enlarged heart, also known as cardiomegaly. This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes thickened or weakened, affecting its ability to pump blood effectively. As a result, Michael requires a heart transplant to save his life. The movie's plot revolves around the challenges John faces in trying to secure the necessary funds for his son's expensive heart transplant surgery. The minimum cost for the procedure is 250,000, with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) needed to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. Unfortunately, John discovers that his health insurance policy does not cover the surgery due to his employer's change in his work status from full-time to part-time. Despite John and Denise's efforts to raise the down payment, they can only come up with a third of the required amount. As the hospital grows impatient and releases Michael, John decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes to the emergency room armed with a handgun, takes eleven hostages, and demands that his son's name be put on the recipient list as soon as possible. Throughout the tense hostage situation, John and his hostages form a bond as they come to understand each other and his desperate predicament. They also assist in treating each other's medical conditions and uncovering the truth behind some of their stories, such as Julie and Mitch's fabricated account of their car accident. In summary, the central issue with John's son, Michael, is his enlarged heart, which necessitates a heart transplant to save his life. This serves as the catalyst for the movie's plot, highlighting the difficulties faced by families attempting to navigate healthcare systems and insurance policies, as well as the lengths a parent might go to in order to save their child's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We want to find out the value of \\"b\\" in the equation -18 * b = -9 * b + 18. 1. To start, let's get all the \\"b\\" terms on one side. So, we'll add 9 * b to both sides. This will cancel out the -9 * b on the right side. -18 * b + 9 * b = -9 * b + 9 * b + 18 2. Now the equation looks like this: -9 * b = 18 3. To find out what \\"b\\" is, we need to divide by -9.

Sleeping is one of the most important things you do to take care of your body––and it helps with weight loss too! Staying well-rested will lead to more calories burned, more fat lost, and even less late-night snacking. There are many other added bonuses to getting enough sleep including increased focus and concentration levels, higher energy levels, and better decision making skills. . It takes your brain about 20 minutes to catch up with your stomach. This means that you will actually be full before your brain is able to communicate that with you. If you eat more slowly, this will help you avoid overeating and it will give your brain more time to communicate your level of fullness to the rest of your body.  If you struggle with this, try chewing your food more thoroughly. Chew each bite a certain several times before swallowing. It may help to count the bites at first until your body adjusts to eating more slowly. Avoid eating when you're distracted — it's easier to overeat if you're not paying attention to what you're eating. Exercising will help you lose water weight by increasing your sweat levels, which means your body is expelling water. You will also shift some of your body’s water content into the muscles, rather than letting it remain outside the cells. Cardio and weight training are the best ways to lose weight. Try alternating your workouts between these two methods – cardio one day, weight training the next.  Try doing some form of moderate to vigorous cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes 3 times per week. Running, cycling, rowing, and swimming are all forms of cardio you can do. Do weight training exercises for 30 minutes 3 times a week, like weighted squats, deadlifts, and leg presses. If you don’t currently exercise, try making a commitment to work out once a week and building from there. Weighing yourself frequently will allow you to observe weight changes and pinpoint potentially problematic behavior. People who weigh themselves more frequently are more in-tuned with changes in their weight, and are more likely to take preventative measures.  Weigh yourself at the same time every day (preferably first thing in the morning) for the most consistent results. It’s normal for your weight to fluctuate from day to day, especially during menstruation. In order to be able to report your symptoms accurately to your doctor, you should keep a journal that records all of the relevant details. Write down everything you eat each day, when you exercise and for how long, and how much you weigh.  You can also use an app, like MyFitnessPal, to keep track of what you're eating and how much you're exercising. There are also quite a few online tracking apps that allow women to enter information about their menstrual cycle, along with other symptoms related to their cycle. This will be a handy tool to refer back to during a conversation with your doctor. Summary:","output":"Adequate sleep, mindful eating, regular exercise, consistent weigh-ins, and tracking one's habits can contribute to weight loss, improved focus, and better decision-making skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Authorities are investigating whether Fox Lake Police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz and his son, Donald, a soldier in the Army, conducted a sham marriage with the rogue cop’s mistress to improperly take money and benefits from the Army, according to a source familiar with the investigation.      Investigators have found that Joseph Gliniewicz was having an affair with a woman who had recently gotten divorced and needed money to buy food as well as health care benefits for her two children, the source said.      Gliniewicz allegedly arranged for his son, Donald “D.J.” Gliniewicz to marry the woman for a brief period of time while Donald Gliniewicz served in the Army, the source said.      With the addition of the family, Donald Gliniewicz would get about 1,750 a month for being married and having two children to support, the source said. Gliniewicz’s mistress would get 500, and Donald Gliniewicz would get the rest.      The two were married for about a year, the source said. A dissolution of marriage was filed in Lake County at the end of 2014, records show.      D.J. Gliniewicz could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday night. ||||| Gliniewicz autopsy report            Disgraced Fox Lake Police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was portrayed as a hero immediately after his staged shooting death, but his personnel records, released by the village Thursday after months of delay, show a much different story: an officer who repeatedly faced complaints that he was drunk in public, deceptive and sexually harassed women.      In a Feb. 1, 2009, letter sent to the village mayor, submitted by anonymous members of the Fox Lake Police Department, officers complained about Gliniewicz making threats and sexually harassing a dispatcher; having to be escorted out of bars by bouncers because he was highly intoxicated; stiffing another bar on a 300 tab; taking his family on vacation to Wisconsin in his squad car; grabbing women’s breasts at department Christmas parties; and being found repeatedly drunk in public and being belligerent with officers who confronted him.      A Fox Lake dispatcher wrote in an April 2003 memo about a comment Gliniewicz made about putting “a round of bullets” in her chest. She said she couldn’t recall the exact comment, nor her response. But she said Gliniewicz then replied, “not if they don’t find the body, and there are a lot of lakes around here.” She said she initially felt threatened, but later realized he was joking.      Records also show that Gliniewicz had attempted elaborate subterfuges to get himself out of trouble in the past.      In 1988, a detective reported Gliniewicz to a supervisor after officers found Gliniewicz passed out behind the wheel of his pickup truck about 1 a.m. The truck was parked on the shoulder with “the engine running full-throttle” as the unconscious and unresponsive Gliniewicz sat with this foot on the gas.      The letter indicates the detective arrived at the scene after officers who responded could not rouse Gliniewicz. The detective had the truck towed and took Gliniewicz home, only to find the next day that Gliniewicz had reported the truck stolen. When he called Gliniewicz’s home, the answering machine message said Gliniewicz was out looking for his truck.      When questioned by the detective — the same officer who had driven him home the night before — Gliniewicz said he had been drinking at a bar and could not recall what happened to his truck, but that his roommate’s girlfriend had seen the truck parked at his house about 4 a.m.      The new revelations about Gliniewicz came as the Fox Lake village administrator said Thursday that reports that Gliniewicz had explored hiring a hit man to kill her were “quite unbelievable and almost surreal.”      “My concern is my family. It’s quite unbelievable and almost surreal,” Village Administrator Anne Marrin said at a news conference Thursday. Marrin said she did not think her safety was at risk now.      Authorities said Wednesday that Gliniewicz staged his suicide on Sept. 1 to look like a murder. He faced mounting pressure as Marrin audited the finances of a police youth group he led. The rogue officer feared that she would discover that he had been stealing tens of thousands of dollars meant for kids that he spent on porn, a gym membership, his mortgage and vacations.      Shortly after she was hired, Marrin began auditing all village programs. In March, she started a review of the village’s police Explorers program, a youth program for teens interested in law enforcement careers run by Gliniewicz.      In text messages released by the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force on Wednesday, Gliniewicz was clearly distressed that the audit would reveal his embezzlement from the youth group, and he seemed to consider Marrin an enemy. Gliniewicz said he had “MANY SCENARIOS” to get rid of his unsuspecting adversary, from discrediting her by planting evidence to dumping her body in a remote nature area near the Wisconsin and Illinois border.      The Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that Gliniewicz had explored hiring a hit man to kill her. He had reached out to a high-ranking member of the infamous Outlaw motorcycle gang, authorities said.      Investigators also found cocaine in Gliniewicz’s desk, and given his mentions of planting evidence, speculated that he was considering planting it on Marrin, authorities said.      At the press conference, Marrin said she was unaware of her role as Gliniewicz’s nemesis. The two seldom talked, usually only ahead of village events where the Explorers helped police manage traffic and parking, she said.      “Most of our interactions were very pleasant,” Marrin said.      Marrin said there were numerous questions once she began looking into the Explorers: Gliniewicz could not provide a roster of participants or parental consent forms, and the group seemed not to have a budget. Gliniewicz had direct control over program funds, Marrin said.      “There were a lot of red flags,” she said.      The day before Gliniewicz staged his suicide, Marrin had asked him to complete an inventory of Explorers equipment kept at a village building, a requirement for the village to review its liability insurance. Gliniewicz failed to turn over the list, and in a text message to an unnamed person, he wrote: “She now has demanded a complete inventory of exploder [sic] central and a financial report . . . FML.”      Marrin emailed Gliniewicz and asked for the inventory list again the morning of Sept. 1.      “He said, ‘I will have it to you by noon or 1 o’clock,’” Marrin said.      Shortly before 8 a.m. that morning, Gliniewicz radioed dispatchers to say he was investigating “suspicious activity” at a remote abandoned cement plant and saw three men there. Back-up officers Gliniewicz had requested found him fatally shot.      In the days that followed, hundreds of police joined the search for suspects, and Fox Lake residents hosted fundraisers and mourned the 30-year-veteran officer with prayer vigils and a hero’s funeral. Investigators this week said Gliniewicz committed suicide, staging his death to make it appear he had died in struggle with his fictional assailants. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      The Gliniewicz family reportedly took part in a sham marriage to boost the military benefits to the lieutenant’s son.      Sources tell WGN Investigates that officials were briefed about the possibility prior to Wednesday’s news conference where Lt. Joe Gliniewicz’s death was declared a suicide.      WGN is told the information was gathered during the investigation of the lieutenant’s life as authorities came to the suicide conclusion.      According to sources, Gliniewicz, who was married, had an affair with a woman. He later arranged to have that woman marry his son, D.J. Gliniewicz, who is in the army in order to boost the military benefits for D.J., since being married could add up to thousands more per year.      WGN Investigates learned that marriage did not last long between D.J. and a woman named Kathryn Grams. The marriage was dissolved just after Christmas, 2014.      Sources say the question now is whether D.J. could face court martial as information about the sham army marriage comes to light.      WGN obtained part of Lt. Gliniewicz's personnel file that details a history of complaints going back two decades.      They include:      His failure to show up at work on occasion.      An incidence when he passed out in his truck, with the engine running, after a night of drinking. Officers were unable to wake him. They took him home. The next day Gliniewicz had no memory of the incident and thought his truck had been stolen.      There are also complaints from bar owners complaining about Gliniewicz drinking to excess.      He was accused of groping a woman's breast at a Christmas party.      Frustrated officers in 2009 sent a letter to the Village Board complaining that the former police chief ignored Glienewicz's numerous sexual harassment complaints and intoxication.

The rocket’s first-stage booster touched down on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, marking a thrilling milestone in spaceflight history. This historic success validated Al Gore's vision, proving the potential of human ingenuity and reinforcing the need for further exploration of our universe. The launching and precise landing of the rocket served as a testament to not only the dedication of the team at SpaceX but also to the growth of the private space exploration sector as a whole. The DSCOVR satellite, now in deep space, began providing crucial data for monitoring space weather and fostering a greater understanding of Earth's climate. Through this observational data, experts could make better-informed decisions to protect our planet from potential threats like solar storms. The success of the DSCOVR mission caught the world's attention, inspiring a new generation of space enthusiasts and rekindling the passion for space exploration.

In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. (This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy - three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination. It just makes life not worth living.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Advise on investing in equities (Money Magazine) -- Question: I'm a recent college grad with a steady job. Now that I've saved some money I want to invest. I've opened an online brokerage account, but the problem is I have no idea how to pick a stock. Where do I start? -- Celia, New York, N.Y. Answer: There's actually a very simple solution for anyone who wants to invest in equities, but doesn't have the foggiest idea of how to pick even a single stock. Don't buy one stock. Buy a few thousand. Yes, I realize that on the face of it, that may seem absurd. If you're that unsure of your stock-picking prowess, wouldn't buying hundreds or even thousands of stocks be much dicier than trying to settle on just one good one? The answer, paradoxically enough, is no. You're actually taking less risk by buying in bulk, provided you go about it the right way. When you invest in stocks, you are taking on several types of risk. Two of the most important are called systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risk is simply the risk of being in the stock market. Every stock's price fluctuates with the market overall, to one degree or another. To see the extent to which a stock will likely rise more steeply when the market soars or fall more sharply when it drops, you can check out a stat known as beta which you can find by plugging a stock's name or ticker symbol into the Get Quotes box at Yahoo! Finance and then clicking on the Key Statistics link under the Company heading on the quote summary page. The second risk is called idiosyncratic, or specific stock risk. This is the possibility that you'll incur a loss not just because the stock market declines, but that something goes wrong with the particular stock you've chosen. Maybe the new product that's supposed to boost earnings falls flat. Or perhaps an audit reveals that a top exec has been pilfering company funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. The important point, though, is that while you can't get away from systematic risk -- any stock you own will always be tied to the fortunes of the market overall -- you can sidestep much of the idiosyncratic or specific stock risk. How? By diversifying. If you plow all your money into just one stock and the company suits make a series of blunders that sends the firm into bankruptcy, your entire investment stake is in jeopardy. But if you spread your money among many stocks, you dramatically reduce the chances of taking a big hit due to idiosyncratic risk. After all, if you own, say, a couple hundred or more stocks, what are the chances that the management teams of all of them will screw up? In short, when it comes to buying stocks, there is at least some protection in numbers. So how do you get that protection as well as a shot at the long-term investment growth stocks can provide? Well, I say the easiest and most effective way is to invest in a total stock market index fund. When you buy this type of fund, you are effectively getting the entire U.S. stock market in a single fund. That means large, medium and small companies in all industries and sectors of the market the whole enchilada. What's more, you can get all this at a relative bargain price. The annual operating expenses on such funds are typically less than 0.20% of your account value each year, and can even run as low as 0.07%. That's 7 to 20 a year on a 10,000 investment. You can find a total stock market index fund in our MONEY 70 list of recommended funds, although other versions of this type of fund are also available through most large investment firms. You can also buy a total stock market fund as an ETF, or exchange traded fund. Until recently, a downside to ETFs was that brokerage commissions could erode the low annual expense advantage if you're investing small amounts. But a number of firms, including Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard and TD Waterhouse now offer ETFs without the brokerage commissions (although you should still see if there are other fees or account minimums). Before you boot up your computer to invest in a total stock market fund or ETF, however, I have two caveats. First, when you start scouting around the index and ETF world, you'll quickly find that investment firms also tout a mind-numbing array of variations on the total stock market theme, splicing and dicing the market into hundreds of indexes and ETFs focused on sectors, subsectors, market niches and, in my opinion, just plain gimmicky products. As I've noted before, I think investors are better off ignoring such gewgaws, as well as the explicit or implicit idea that you can boost returns by deftly timing your moves in and out of ETFs focusing on particular sectors. Focus instead on investing for the long-term in a broad portfolio such as a total stock index fund. Second, since buying a total stock index fund still leaves you vulnerable to systematic or market risk, I suggest you mitigate that threat a bit by putting some of your investment stash into another asset class -- bonds. You can take the same approach as with stocks by buying a total bond market index fund or ETF. (For guidance on how much to devote to bonds, click here and here. If you still want to try your hand at buying individual stocks, fine. You can learn more about how to do that by checking out our MONEY 101 lesson on investing in stocks and by going to the Stock Investing Courses link under the Learn heading in the Stocks section of Morningstar.com. But I suggest you wait until you've already established a core portfolio using the approach I've suggested here, and then go slow with modest amounts of money. Otherwise, learning about the stock market could be one of the most expensive educations you'll ever get.","output":"A recent college graduate with a steady job wants to start investing in equities but is unsure of how to pick stocks. The recommended approach is to invest in a total stock market index fund, which provides exposure to a large number of stocks, reducing idiosyncratic risk and offering long-term growth potential. By diversifying investments, the investor can minimize the impact of individual stock failures. The inexpensive option of total stock market index funds allows for broad market exposure at a low cost. However, because investing in such funds still involves systematic risk, the investor should also consider putting some of their savings into bonds by investing in a total bond market index fund or ETF. This creates a balanced investment portfolio and reduces the risk associated with stock market fluctuations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table.

The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.  - The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the NASM, is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It holds the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2014, the museum saw approximately 6.7 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. The museum contains the Apollo 11 module, the Friendship 7 which was flown by John Glenn, the Bell X-1 which broke the sound barrier, and the Wright brothers plane near the entrance.   - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year.  - The Bell X-1 was a rocket engine-powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded in 1954. The X-1, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first manned airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the X-planes, a series of American experimental rocket planes (and non-rocket planes) designated for testing of new technologies and often kept secret.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans, who were Americans, on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module \\"Eagle\\" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module \\"Columbia\\" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with \\"Columbia\\" in lunar orbit.  - L'Enfant Plaza is a complex of four commercial buildings grouped around a large plaza in the Southwest section of Washington, D.C.. Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall. The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city. It was dedicated in 1968 after completion of the north and south buildings.  - Roman Kroitor (December 12, 1926  September 17, 2012) was a Canadian filmmaker who was known as an early practitioner of Cinéma vérité, as co-founder of IMAX, and as creator of the Sandde hand-drawn stereoscopic animation system. He was also the original inspiration for the Force, popularized in the \\"Star Wars\\" series.  - The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871  January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867  May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.  - IMAX (an acronym for Image maximum) is a motion picture film format and a set of cinema projection standards developed in Canada by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw. IMAX has the capacity to record and display images of far greater size and resolution than conventional film systems. Since 2002, some feature films have been converted (or upgraded) into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres and some have also been partially shot in IMAX.  - The Smithsonian Institution, established in 1846 \\"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. Originally organized as the \\"United States National Museum,\\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967. Termed \\"the nation's attic\\" for its eclectic holdings of 138 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York City, Virginia, Texas, and Panama. More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates The Institution's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge. The institution's annual budget is around 1.2 billion with 2/3 coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. Institution publications include \\"Smithsonian\\" and \\"Air & Space\\" magazines.  - A documentary film is a nonfictional motion picture intended to some aspect of reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record. Such films were originally shot on film stockthe only medium availablebut now include video and digital productions that can be either direct-to-video, made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas. \\"Documentary\\" has been described as a \\"filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception\\" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.  - Direct-to-video or straight-to-video (also known as direct-to-VHS, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-Blu-ray, direct-to-digital, etc.) refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast. Because inferior sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.  - A film format is a technical definition of a set of standard characteristics regarding image capture on photographic film, for either stills or filmmaking. It can also apply to projected film, either slides or movies. The primary characteristic of a film format is its size and shape.  - Ivan Graeme Ferguson, CM (born 7 October 1929 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian filmmaker and inventor who co-invented IMAX. Ferguson was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1993. He graduated from the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree.  - John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921  December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senator from Ohio.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Meet the Oregon Journalist Who Keeps Taking Down Governors The resignation of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber on Friday is another pelt on the wall for Nigel Jaquiss, a Goldman Sachs oil trader turned muck-raking journalist. Jaquiss, 52, works at Willamette Week, the free alternative weekly in Portland where he reported on allegations of Gov. John Kitzhaber's influence peddling. From that modest perch, Jaquiss also won a Pulitzer Prize, in 2005, for exposing long-hidden sexual assault by former Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, the godfather of Oregon politics. And in 2009, Jaquiss's reporting revealed an improper sexual relationship between then-Portland Mayor Sam Adams and a legislative intern, which Adams initially denied. \\"It's pretty astonishing,\\" Jaquiss wrote in an e-mail. \\"Goldschmidt was no longer in office. Adams stayed in office. So from that perspective, this story had more impact than the other two.\\" “He never loses sight of where he's going.” Tim Gleason, University of Oregon Jaquiss leveled his sites on Kitzhaber, 67, late last year, and in October reported that the governor’s fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, 47, used taxpayer money to advance her green-energy consulting business. Jaquiss has followed the story with a bundle of scoops, feeding the flames that finally consumed Kitzhaber. In Kitzhaber's resignation statement, he acknowledged an \\"escalating media frenzy\\" stemming from the Hayes allegations. Kate Brown, Oregon's Secretary of State, will succeed Kitzhaber. \\"I think Nigel is among the best investigative journalists in the country,\\" says Tim Gleason, the former dean and a professor of journalism at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. \\"What distinguishes Nigel is his ability to focus. He never loses sight of where he's going. He just digs and digs and digs.\\" Jaquiss is a lanky, wonky journalist with none of the pretension of a Goldman trader or governor-slayer. After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1984, he traded oil derivatives for 11 years in New York and Singapore for Cargill, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman. Then he abruptly switched careers and went to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, graduating in 1997. He joined Willamette Week in 1998. He lives in Portland with his wife and three kids, and over lunch often shakes his head at the tawdry affairs in Oregon politics. He regularly beats the Oregonian, the state’s largest newspaper, on political scoops. Jaquiss earned his Pulitzer for breaking a story in May 2004 that revealed a long-rumored relationship in the 1970s between Goldschmidt and his family’s baby sitter, who was 14 at the time. The statute of limitations had expired so Goldschmidt—who was once secretary of transportation for Jimmy Carter—wasn't prosecuted. But Goldschmidt, who had been leading a bid by buyout firm TPG for Portland General Electric and also sitting on the State Board of Higher Education, resigned all his posts. He's since vanished from Oregon politics. Gleason also credits Jaquiss's managing editor, Brent Walth, for the publication's focus on public affairs. \\"Willamette Week has an interesting niche in this state,\\" says Gleason. \\"Others have pulled back more than a little from investigative journalism, but Willamette Week has remained a constant.\\" Before Jaquiss took aim at Kitzhaber directly, he helped kill one of the governor’s pet projects: the Columbia River Crossing, a new bridge across the Columbia River north of Portland. Jaquiss’s reporting showed that estimates for traffic over the bridge were too high and wouldn’t support the mammoth project unless proposed tolls on the span increased. You won't hear much about the Columbia River Crossing or Goldschmidt around Oregon these days. And now that Jaquiss is hanging Kitzhaber's pelt, you probably won't be hearing much from the former governor, either. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article highlights the impactful investigative journalism career of Nigel Jaquiss, an Oregon-based reporter who has garnered a reputation for taking down prominent political figures in the state. The article covers three key instances of his work: 1. In 2005, Jaquiss won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing former Governor Neil Goldschmidt's long-hidden sexual assault. Jaquiss's reporting led to Goldschmidt's resignation from all his posts and his subsequent disappearance from Oregon politics. 2. In 2009, Jaquiss revealed an improper sexual relationship between then-Portland Mayor Sam Adams and a legislative intern. Though Adams initially denied the allegations, his reputation was significantly tarnished by the reporting. 3. The most recent incident involves the resignation of Governor John Kitzhaber, which can be attributed to Jaquiss's dogged pursuit of allegations concerning influence peddling and the misuse of taxpayer money by the governor's fiancée, Cylvia Hayes.  The article also demonstrates the importance of Jaquiss's work as an investigative journalist in keeping a check on those in power in Oregon, as well as highlighting the support of his managing editor, Brent Walth, and the significant role played by the publication Willamette Week in maintaining a focus on public affairs and investigative journalism in the state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information:  - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.  - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras.  - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to  \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus .  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.  - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014.  - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.  - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara.  - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section).  - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.  - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area.  - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.  - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations.  - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus.  - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.  - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

The White House accidentally revealed the name of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan to some 6,000 journalists. The person was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, \\"Chief of Station.\\" The print pool reporter -- a journalist allowed access to or is given information about an event who relays it to the rest of the media -- copied and pasted the list that was provided by the White House. Print pool reports are then distributed by the White House press office, which does not edit them, to a large list of media. In this case, the same reporter, Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post, noticed the unusual entry after the list was distributed and then checked it out with officials. The White House followed up and distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name. In his account to CNN, Wilson said when they arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, \\"manifest for briefing for Pool,\\" Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson and he proceeded to copy and paste that list for the pool report. He then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list. After the initial report had been issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list, which he flagged to the White House official. After checking with the military, the White House official said, \\"This is a problem.\\" The official asked if Wilson would write another pool report, asking journalists to disregard the previous report that contained the list with the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report. He said he was unsure whether that report was distributed. The new list, Wilson said, was distributed by a separate pool report that included details from Obama's speech to the troops. That report included a shorter list of names with a note saying, \\"this is the correct list of participants.\\" Privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident, but so far the White House and CIA officials have declined to comment publicly. A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. In the most recent case before this one, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003. Plame tweeted on Monday that the White House's mistake this past weekend is \\"astonishing.\\" Top U.S. spy pulled from Pakistan after terror threats.

Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him  bewailing their loss.

The Seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small .","output":"The debate topic that these sentences pertain to is the potential relocation of the Seychelles due to the threat of climate change. As a low-lying island nation, the Seychelles is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Consequently, the idea of relocating the entire country to protect its people, culture, and infrastructure has emerged as a topic of debate. The sentences provided give an overview of the key points regarding land availability and size comparisons for this potential relocation. 1. The first sentence emphasizes the size disparity between Kenya, one of the possible relocation options, and the Seychelles. Kenya's land area is more than 1200 times larger than that of the Seychelles, establishing that there is a vast difference in size between the two countries. 2. The second sentence lists other neighboring states (Tanzania, Somalia, and Madagascar) that could potentially provide land for the Seychelles' relocation. It suggests that these countries have ample land that they could offer without causing significant inconvenience to their own citizens. 3. The third sentence highlights the overall feasibility of finding enough land for the relocation due to the availability of land in neighboring states, thus making it a plausible option for the Seychelles to consider. 4. The fourth sentence provides a size comparison with a known city, indicating that the land area of the Seychelles is actually smaller than Washington D.C., further emphasizing the challenges that the nation faces in terms of space and vulnerability to climate change. 5. The fifth sentence highlights that the Seychelles is one of many nations whose existence is threatened by climate change, and that its small size amplifies this threat. This implies that addressing the issue of relocation might not only be vital for the Seychelles but for other similarly affected nations as well. In conclusion, the debate topic in question revolves around the potential relocation of the Seychelles due to the threats posed by climate change - with a focus on land availability, size comparisons, and the broader implications for other vulnerable nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1 states that the jury has reached a verdict and found Moore guilty of several charges. Hence, they aren't \\"deadlocked\\" or unable to reach a verdict, as suggested by Sentence 2. In legal terms, a jury being \\"deadlocked\\" or a \\"hung jury\\" means that the jurors cannot agree upon a verdict unanimously after all reasonable efforts have been made to reach one. Consequently, no official verdict is given, and the case may need to be tried again. This is distinctly different from the scenario described in Sentence 1, where it's said that a verdict has indeed been reached where Moore is judged as guilty. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true (indicating that a verdict has been rendered), then Sentence 2, suggesting that the jury was deadlocked and could not reach a verdict, must be false.

Solve 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 for j.","output":"To solve this equation for j, you first need to simplify the equation by gathering the j terms together. The equation given is: 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 You need to carry out the subtraction operation on the left side. 79*j - 74*j gives you 5*j. Hence, the equation becomes: 5*j + 15 = 0 The next step is to isolate j. To accomplish this, you need to get rid of that '+15' on the left side. You can do this by performing the opposite mathematical operation. The opposite of '+15' is '-15'.  So, you subtract 15 from both sides: 5*j = -15 Following, to completely isolate j, you need to get rid of the '5*' by dividing both sides by 5 because the opposite of multiplication is division.  When you divide -15 by 5, the equation becomes: j = -15 / 5 Finally, solving the equation yields: j = -3 So, the solution to the equation 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 is j = -3."},{"instruction":"This article: The story takes place entirely in New York.
