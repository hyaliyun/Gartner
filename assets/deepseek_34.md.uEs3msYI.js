In the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would the y-axis be higher or lower than Atlantic Ocean's acidity test  Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity.  Hint: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution.

Question: The gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","output":"I apologize for not providing you the choices in your original question. However, I can give a detailed and long answer to the question of how the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on various factors. The gravitational force exerted by an object is determined by its mass and the distance to another object as described by Sir Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed by the formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where: - F is the gravitational force between the two objects - G is the gravitational constant, which has a value of approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2 - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects From this formula, we can deduce that the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on two main factors: 1. Mass: The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects. This means that if the mass of one object is doubled, the gravitational force between them will also double, assuming neither the mass of the other object nor the distance between the two changes. Similarly, if the mass of both objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them will increase four times. 2. Distance: The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two objects. This means that the force decreases as the distance increases. Specifically, if the distance between the two objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them will be only one-fourth of the initial force. Conversely, if the distance is reduced by half, the gravitational force will be four times stronger. Since the gravitational constant G does not change, the gravitational force is mainly dependent on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. Hence, to answer the question directly: the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its mass and the distance to another object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since -1950 and 1899 are both constants, they can be combined. -1950 + 1899 = -51 So, the equation becomes: 51*d - 51 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable d. To do this, we need to get rid of the -51 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding 51 to both sides of the equation: 51*d - 51 + 51 = 0 + 51 This simplifies to: 51*d = 51 Step 3: Solve for d. Now that we have isolated the term 51*d, we can solve for d by dividing both sides of the equation by 51: 51*d / 51 = 51 / 51 This simplifies to: d = 1 So, the solution to the equation is: d = 1"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Salamandridae is a family of salamanders consisting of true salamanders and newts. Currently, 74 species (with more expected) have been identified in the Northern Hemisphere - Europe, Asia, the northern tip of Africa, and North America. Salamandrids are distinguished from other salamanders by the lack of rib or costal grooves along the sides of their bodies and by their rough skin.  - The Bosphorus (or ) or Bosporus (\\"Bósporos\\" ) is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching .  - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Anatolia (from Greek , '  \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.  - The Aegean Sea  is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes.  - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\",  \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources.  - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.  - Honshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kant plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.  - Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela. Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone.  - Triturus is a genus of newts comprising the crested and the marbled newts , which are found from Great Britain through most of continental Europe to westernmost Siberia , Anatolia , and the Caspian Sea region . Their English names refer to their appearance : marbled newts have a green -- black colour pattern , while the males of crested newts , which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside , develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase . Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation - rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady , protection - rich land habitats close to their breeding sites . Males court females with a ritualised display , ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female . After fertilisation , a female lays 200 -- 400 eggs , folding them individually into leaves of water plants . Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land - dwelling juveniles . Historically , most European newts were included in the genus , but taxonomists have split off the alpine newt ( Ichthyosaura ) , the small - bodied newts ( Lissotriton ) and the banded newts ( Ommatotriton ) as separate genera . The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts ( Calotriton ) . Two species of marbled newts and six species of crested newts , formerly considered subspecies , are accepted , with one additional crested newt species suspected . Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap , hybridisation may take place . Although not immediately threatened , crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines , caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation . Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover - rich , natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected . All species are legally protected in Europe , and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves .  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law.  - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle.  - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - North Asia or Northern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of Siberia, and Russian Far East in the Asian portion of Russia  the area east of the Ural Mountains. A large part of the region is also known as Asian Russia.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What island did Amelia Earhart crash her Lockheed Electra on? from the following article ?  During the 1930s, the Navy contracted a 1.5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet's carriers to enter it. Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island.  Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.

Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \\"Heliocosma\\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile.  - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae.  - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name.  - \`\` Lasperesia '' and \`\` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous \`\` Mexican jumping beans '' .  - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'. Answer:","output":"The subject entity in this context is the subfamily Olethreutinae, while the object entity with the relation of 'parent taxon' is the family Tortricidae. This relationship indicates that Olethreutinae is a subfamily within the larger family of Tortricidae."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Leslie Feist was born on 13 February 1976 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her parents are both artists. Her father, Harold Feist, is an American-Canadian abstract expressionist painter who taught at both the Alberta College of Art and Design and Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. Her mother, Lyn Feist, was a student of ceramics from Saskatchewan. Context: In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her start in music when she founded and was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be confused with the English band Placebo). She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring the Ramones. At this concert she met Brendan Canning, whose band hHead performed immediately before hers, and with whom she joined in Broken Social Scene ten years later.  In 1995, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from vocal cord damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1996. That year she was asked by Noah Mintz of hHead to play bass in his solo project Noah's Arkweld. She played the bass guitar in Noah's Arkweld for a year despite never having played bass before. In 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist for the band By Divine Right and toured with them throughout 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also played guitar for some live performances by Bodega, but was never an official member of the band.  In 1999, Feist moved into a Queen West apartment above Come As You Are with a friend of a friend, Merrill Nisker, who then began to perform as electro-punk musician Peaches. Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches' shows, using a sock puppet and calling herself \\"Bitch Lap Lap\\". The two also toured together in England from 2000-2001, staying with Justine Frischmann of Elastica and MIA Feist appeared as a guest vocalist on The Teaches of Peaches. Feist appears in Peaches' video for the song \\"Lovertits\\", suggestively rubbing and licking a bike. Later, Feist covered this song with Gonzales (whom she met while touring with Peaches) on her album Open Season. In 2006, Feist contributed backup vocals on a track entitled \\"Give 'Er\\", which appeared on Peaches' album Impeach My Bush. Question: What happened with her Answer:","output":"Throughout her career, Leslie Feist has been involved in various music projects and collaborations.

Identify the main action: 'stay with me.' 2. Identify the context: 'while you are in town.' This context suggests that 'stay' here means to reside or temporarily live with someone. 3.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"__ was preceded by Napoleon III.\\"  Context: \\"Although public opinion in Paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the Prussians, the Government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer, and that Gambetta's provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve Paris. President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Adolphe Thiers was preceded by Napoleon III as the leader of France. In the given context, we can see the turmoil that France went through after the fall of Napoleon III's regime, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. Napoleon III, also known as Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, was the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and served as the Emperor of the Second French Empire from 1852 to 1870. His reign came to an end after the disastrous defeat of the French army by the Prussian forces at the Battle of Sedan in September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. After this defeat, Napoleon III was captured by the Prussians and the Second Empire collapsed. In the aftermath of Napoleon III's capture, the French Government of National Defence was formed on September 4, 1870, in response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in France during the war. President Louis Jules Trochu, Jules Favre, and Léon Gambetta were among the key members of this temporary government. As described in the context, during the following months, the French forces struggled against the advancing Prussian army. The situation in Paris was dire, and the citizens were strongly against surrendering to the Prussians. However, the French government knew they could not defend Paris indefinitely and Gambetta's provincial armies were unlikely to succeed in relieving the city. Realizing the desperate situation they were in, President Trochu resigned on January 25, 1871, and Jules Favre took his place. Two days later, on January 27, Favre signed the surrender with the Prussians in Versailles, and the armistice came into effect at midnight. Despite this surrender, Léon Gambetta was furious and attempted a failed attack on German forces at Orleans. After a delegation of Parisian diplomats negotiated with Gambetta, he relented and stepped down on February 6, surrendering control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which ordered an immediate ceasefire across France. In the subsequent elections, Adolphe Thiers emerged as the new leader, becoming the Chief of the Executive Power in the French Third Republic. Thiers was a seasoned statesman who had previously served as a prime minister during the July Monarchy period and played a crucial role in negotiating peace with the victorious Prussians, putting an end to the Franco-Prussian War. Thus, Adolphe Thiers followed the rule of Napoleon III as the leader of France in the aftermath of the war and the establishment of the French Third Republic."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem that looks like this: 93*a + 393*a + 5832 = 0 To solve this problem for \\"a\\", we will follow these steps: 1. Combine together the terms with \\"a\\" (like adding apples with apples) 2. Solve for \\"a\\" Let's begin with step 1. We have two terms with \\"a\\": 93*a and 393*a.

To do this, we need to get \\"a\\" by itself on one side of the equation. So, we will subtract 5832 from both sides: 486*a = -5832 Now, to find the value of \\"a\\", we need to divide both sides by 486: a = -5832 / 486 When we divide -5832 by 486, we get: a = -12 So, the solution to the problem is a = -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Movie title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has... The answer is:","output":"The name of Dickie's fiancée is Marge Sherwood in the movie \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nothing RB LaDainian Tomlinson does on the ground really impresses the San Diego Chargers at this point. For that, the star running back must take to the air. Tomlinson seemed to be trying to jump out of Candlestick Park while hurdling the goal line on one of his four touchdown runs&#8212;and his elevation was the Chargers' inspiration. Tomlinson set a franchise record while seemingly spending most of the afternoon in the end zone, and QB Philip Rivers passed for a career-high 334 yards and two more scores in San Diego's 48-19 victory over San Francisco. Tomlinson got his third score 33 seconds before halftime, capping San Diego's 35-point first half and essentially finishing off the 49ers (2-4) with an astonishingly high leap over the goal-line pile. WR Bryan Gilmore and FB Moran Norris caught scoring passes as the Chargers gave up more points in the first half alone than they allowed in any of their first four games. But San Diego shut out San Francisco in the second half, with QB Alex Smith finishing 20 of 31 for 214 yards. San Francisco's offense has been better than expected heading to the club's bye week, but the defense has been just as bad as feared. Two weeks after giving up 41 points to the Chiefs, the 49ers seemed lost from the moment top CB Walt Harris was ruled out with a hamstring injury. This crushing blow put the 49ers record at 2-4. Answer this question: How many points did the Chargers win by?","output":"To find out how many points the Chargers won by, we need to subtract the points scored by the 49ers from the points scored by the Chargers. In the text provided, it states that the San Diego Chargers scored 48 points, while the San Francisco 49ers scored 19 points. Step 1: Identify the points scored by each team Chargers' points = 48 49ers' points = 19 Step 2: Subtract 49ers' points from Chargers' points to find the point difference Point difference = Chargers' points - 49ers' points Point difference = 48 - 19 Step 3: Calculate the point difference Point difference = 29 The Chargers won by 29 points."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Located south of Libya, west of Sudan, and east of Niger, Chad is one of the largest countries on the African continent. Chad is landlocked and surrounded by six countries in total: Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Its extreme northern zone, the Tibesti Region, stretches into the Sahara Desert, while the southernmost part of the country is in the Sahel belt, where the savanna transitions into desert. N'Djamena, located on the southwestern border of Chad near Cameroon, is the capital and largest city of the country. It was founded in the early 20th century by the French and was originally named Fort-Lamy. It was later renamed N'Djamena in 1973, reflecting the country's break from its colonial past and its move toward a more independent identity.  The city has grown rapidly in recent years, and functions as the main economic hub of Chad. Despite the political instability and conflicts that have beset Chad since its independence, N'Djamena continues to develop. It is known for its vibrant markets, impressive National Museum, and central Mosque. The official languages of Chad are Arabic and French, and the country is predominantly Muslim. Chad is also rich in gold and uranium and has significant oil reserves, but it remains one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world due to mismanagement and internal conflicts.

Input: Abstract: The archaeal ATPase complex PAN, the homolog of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome-regulatory ATPases, was shown to associate transiently with the 20S proteasome upon binding of ATP or ATPgammaS, but not ADP. By electron microscopy (EM), PAN appears as a two-ring structure, capping the 20S, and resembles two densities in the 19S complex. The N termini of the archaeal 20S alpha subunits were found to function as a gate that prevents entry of seven-residue peptides but allows entry of tetrapeptides. Upon association with the 20S particle, PAN stimulates gate opening. Although degradation of globular proteins requires ATP hydrolysis, the PAN-20S complex with ATPgammaS translocates and degrades unfolded and denatured proteins. Rabbit 26S proteasomes also degrade these unfolded proteins upon ATP binding, without hydrolysis. Thus, although unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding alone supports ATPase-20S association, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded substrates into the proteasome, which can occur by facilitated diffusion through the ATPase..

Hypothesis: The people are sitting in church. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis from the given premise. The premise and hypothesis present two distinct scenarios that don't link explicitly towards a common conclusion. The premise describes a situation where two people are standing next to a railing with a dog. It suggests an outdoor or at least an open environment that permits dogs. This scenario might imply a location such as outside a house, in a park, or at a subdivision where railings could be present. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests a completely different setting. It references two people sitting in a church, which typically has a more formal, solemn atmosphere and is generally an indoor setting. In many cases, animals like dogs are not permitted in such places due to respect, cleanliness, or noise precautionary measures. Based on these differences between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot logically connect the two together without further evidence or clarification. The setting, actions, and factors involved (like the dog) in each situation provide no immediate or clear route to inference. In the world of logic, the conclusion must stem directly and noticeably from the premise, which does not happen in this case. A premise is considered good or acceptable if the offered reasoning or evidence is credible and relevant. In this specific context, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other instead of creating a coherent sequence of events that allow to build the one situation from the other. So, without more information connecting these two scenarios, the conclusion (hypothesis) cannot be drawn from the provided premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the sentence \\"Man kayaking in a raging river.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" can be considered a true statement based on the sentence \\"Man kayaking in a raging river.\\"  In the original sentence, \\"Man kayaking in a raging river,\\" it is implied that a man is maneuvering a kayak in a river that is described as raging, which presumably means it is a fast-flowing or intense river. The key information that the sentence provides about the man's location is that he is in a river. When the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" is analyzed, the proposition that \\"a man is on the river\\" falls within the scope of the activity described in the first sentence. That means, by virtue of his kayaking, the man can be said to be \\"on\\" the river, though it's not exactly specific on how he is on the river.  While it's true that the sentences don't carry exactly the same implications (for example, the second sentence lacks the specificity about the man kayaking and the river being raging), there's still a broad overlap in what they convey. The activities contained within the second sentence are subset of the activities contained within the first sentence, and hence, the second statement could be seen as a general description of the first.  So to conclude, despite the removal of specific details, the sentence \\"A man is on the river.\\" is a true sentence given the original sentence \\"Man kayaking in the raging river.\\" Its veracity stems from the fact that it refers to the same man and river, albeit in a less specific context. However, it is worth noting that while it is possible to infer the conditions of the second sentence based on the first, the reverse would not provide the same level of detailed understanding."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What might you feel if you're meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time?

In the 1960s , Newtown withdrew from Anderson Township by forming a paper city .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia might seem to convey the same message at first glance, they are actually expressing different ideas when examined more closely. Let's dissect each sentence to better understand the contextual differences. 1. \\"Anderson Township withdrew from Newtown in the 1960s by forming a paper township.\\" In this sentence, the implied meaning is that Anderson Township was originally a part of Newtown. At some point during the 1960s, Anderson Township decided it wanted to separate from Newtown and establish itself as a distinct entity. They accomplished this by creating and adopting the legal and administrative framework of a \\"paper township.\\" The phrase \\"paper township\\" suggests that the separation wasn't based on any physical or geographic changes but was rather a change in management and governance at the administrative level. 2. \\"In the 1960s, Newtown withdrew from Anderson Township by forming a paper city.\\" In this sentence, the implied meaning is that Newtown was originally either a part of or somehow connected to Anderson Township. To separate from Anderson Township, Newtown created a \\"paper city\\" during the 1960s. The phrase \\"paper city\\" indicates that the separation was also likely based on administrative or governance changes, rather than physical or geographic factors. In summary, the main difference between these two sentences is which entity is withdrawing from the other to establish its own independent governance. In the first sentence, Anderson Township is separating itself from Newtown, while in the second sentence, it is Newtown that is separating itself from Anderson Township. The process of separation is similar in both cases, as they both involve forming new legal and administrative entities, a \\"paper township\\" and a \\"paper city,\\" respectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Part #2: Determine whether Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 agree or contradict each other. Usage: Sentence 1 and sentence 2 do not contradict, but they don't clearly agree either because Sentence 1 talks about four kids while Sentence 2 specifically talks about girls without specifying their number. This is why our job is to alter sentence 2. Part #3: Alter sentence 2 to make it clearly agree with sentence 1. Usage: An example altered Sentence 2 could be \\"The children are conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\" In this case, we alter 'girls' to 'children' to agree with 'kids' in sentence 1 and added them conversing to show what they are doing on the ledge according to sentence 1. Part #4: Ensure the generated sentences are short, with less than 15 words. Usage: In the above example, \\"The children are conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\", it meets the criteria since it only uses eight words which is less than fifteen. Part #5: New information can be introduced. Usage: Here, we have not introduced new information, but we could have. For example, we could say, \\"The children are happily conversing while sitting on a ledge.\\", which adds the new information that they are happy. Part #6: Avoid using pronouns to confuse the subject of the sentence. Usage: In the altered sentence, 'children' is used instead of any pronoun to avoid confusion about the subject.

The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore.

However, the mention of Khrushchev's \\"thaw\\" provides a clue that the prisoners' release was likely associated with the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and during his tenure, he initiated a period known as the \\"Khrushchev Thaw.\\" This era marked a time of increased openness, transparency, and liberalization in the Soviet Union, which led to the relaxation of censorship, greater freedom of speech, and the release of political prisoners who had been imprisoned during Joseph Stalin's rule. Consequently, it can be inferred that the release of political prisoners in the 1950s was carried out under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev and his administration, as part of the broader reforms and liberalization measures during the \\"Khrushchev Thaw\\" period."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Where the Beat Meets the Street is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side - project , Bobby and the Midnites . The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 .  - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \\"the rhythm devils\\".  - Robert Hall \\"Bob\\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016.  - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion.  - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes.  - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career.  - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of The Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, The Other Ones changed their name to The Dead.  - Deadhead or Dead Head is a name given to fans of the American psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\".  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - William \\"Bill\\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer. He played with the Grateful Dead for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy & the Kids.  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.  - RatDog (sometimes known as The Ratdog Revue, Bob Weir & RatDog or Ratdog) is an American rock band. The group began as a side project for Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and bassist Rob Wasserman. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in December 1995 following the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9 of that year, RatDog became Bob Weir's primary band. The band performed until July, 2014. They performed Grateful Dead tunes primarily with a mixture of covers (including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry songs), along with some originals. RatDog's repertoire consisted of more than 150 songs.    What is the relationship between 'where the beat meets the street' and 'columbia records'? Answer:","output":"\\"Where the Beat Meets the Street\\" is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side project, Bobby and the Midnites. The relationship between this album and Columbia Records lies in the fact that John Mayer, who later collaborated with Bob Weir in Dead & Company, was signed to Columbia Records during the early stages of his career.  John Mayer began working with former Grateful Dead members, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann, to form the band Dead & Company in 2015. Mayer, who gained recognition in the industry after signing with Columbia Records, brought his extensive guitar skills and love for the Grateful Dead's music into the new band. The formation of Dead & Company represents a kind of interconnected relationship between \\"Where the Beat Meets the Street\\" (a work of one of the Grateful Dead members) and Columbia Records (the label that helped propel John Mayer's career)."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Sentence 1: It is this.  Sentence 2: This is what it is. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment is a relationship between two linguistic expressions such that the truth of one (e.g., Sentence 1) logically implies the truth of the other (e.g., Sentence 2). In this case, both sentences refer to the same thing and have an equivalent meaning, but they employ different syntactic structures. Sentence 1: \\"It is this.\\" In this sentence, the subject \\"It\\" is used to refer to an unspecified entity. The verb \\"is\\" links the subject to the predicate \\"this,\\" which represents the object or concept being discussed. This construction often follows an initial statement or question that establishes the topic, for instance: \\"Can you tell me about the book?\\" \\"It is this.\\" In this context, \\"It is this\\" affirms that the book is the specific object that is being referenced or discussed. Sentence 2: \\"This is what it is.\\" In this sentence, the subject \\"This\\" refers to the same object or concept as \\"It\\" in the first sentence. The verb \\"is\\" links the subject to the predicate \\"what it is,\\" which expresses the essence, nature, or identity of the subject. This construction is often used to emphasize the true nature or characteristics of an entity, as in: \\"I've discovered that this idea is revolutionary.\\" \\"This is what it is.\\" As with Sentence 1, the speaker is affirming the properties or nature of the subject in question. In both sentences, the speaker is essentially confirming and asserting something about the subject at hand. Even though the syntactic structures of the two sentences differ, the semantic content – the meaning and reference – remains the same. Therefore, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: \\"In what year did it become impossible for lay cardinals such as Teodolfo Mertel to exist?\\"  Context: \\"At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The year in which it became impossible for lay cardinals, such as Teodolfo Mertel, to exist was 1917, when the Code of Canon Law was revised and promulgated by Pope Benedict XV. This change in the ecclesiastical law established new requirements for the appointment of cardinals, thus putting an end to the phenomenon of \\"lay cardinals.\\" Before the promulgation of the revised Code of Canon Law in 1917, cardinals could be appointed from among those who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but had not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. These individuals, despite being clerics, were inaccurately referred to as \\"lay cardinals\\" and were allowed to marry within the bounds of the ecclesiastical law. Teodolfo Mertel was one of the last cardinals belonging to this category, and his death in 1899 marked the end of an era in the College of Cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law reformed the requirements for the appointment of cardinals, stating that only those who had already been ordained as priests or bishops could be eligible for the cardinalate. By making this change, the Church aimed to ensure that all cardinals would possess the necessary ecclesiastical education and qualifications to carry out the specific functions assigned to them, which include advising the Pope, participating in the election of a new Pope, and governing the Church both on a local and universal level. Furthermore, since the time of Pope John XXIII in the late 1950s, it became a norm that a priest appointed as a cardinal must be consecrated as a bishop unless he obtains a dispensation from the Pope. This requirement further emphasized the importance of episcopal ordination in the cardinalate and ensured that cardinals are equipped to perform their essential roles within the Church hierarchy. In conclusion, it was in 1917 when the revision of the Code of Canon Law by Pope Benedict XV made it impossible for lay cardinals, such as Teodolfo Mertel, to exist. The new requirements for the appointment of cardinals not only brought an end to the phenomenon of \\"lay cardinals\\" but also strengthened the role of cardinals within the Church, offering better-prepared and more qualified individuals to carry out their vital responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time? , can you please find it?   Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on \\"Some Time\\" is Lennon. The text mentions \\"Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono...\\" and repeatedly refers to someone named Lennon prior to and after this statement. This person is John Lennon, a member of the Beatles, who was famously married to Yoko Ono. They often collaborated on music and art projects, and were both active in political activism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:Tahir Nazir, 40, obtained a fake university ID card and trawled the internet looking for student nights so he could target vulnerable young women. Fuelled by drink and drugs he followed and then attacked his victims, Manchester Crown Court heard. He was sentenced on Friday after being found guilty of a string of sex offences at his trial in March. The divorcee from Glasgow hired a car and embarked on a tour of university towns and cities in Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Oxford, Bristol and Cardiff. The court heard an examination of Nazir's mobile phone found he had conducted internet searches for \\"high school girls\\" and \\"freshers'\\" week, particularly around Swansea and Cardiff. In the early hours of 22 September a visitor to a shared house in the Cathays student neighbourhood of Cardiff awoke to find Nazir on top of her \\"very drunk\\" friend. CCTV showed Nazir prowling the corridors of student flats trying doors in an attempt to find victims. Other images showed him following a student into a building. He was caught after sneaking into a student house in Fallowfield, Manchester, last November. Several female undergraduates heard someone systematically going through the house, trying their locked bedroom door handles. They called police who arrested him nearby. Analysis of DNA linked him to a sex attack five days earlier at a block of flats in Hulme. He was convicted of trespass with intent to commit an offence, sexual assault, attempted rape, and three charges of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence. Judge Martin Steiger QC said: \\"His campaign involved taking detailed photos of premises where students lived, in particular entrances and access rooms. \\"And finally it involved his posing as a student for which purpose he had obtained a highly convincing fake student union ID card.\\" He said he preyed on \\"drunken students hoping no doubt that they would not remember or would not complain about his conduct\\". Nazir wrote a letter to the judge in which he \\"apologised to the victims and acknowledged the seriousness of his crimes\\", according to his barrister Richard Littler. After the hearing, Det Insp Ian Bourne, from South Wales Police, called Nazir a \\"predatory offender\\". He said: \\"South Wales Police takes all reports of sexual violence extremely seriously and a detailed forensic search of the house resulted in a DNA profile being obtained. \\"This was only identified as Nazir's when, less than two months later, he brazenly committed a strikingly similar crime in Manchester. \\"We would like to commend the courage of the victim and her housemates who all gave evidence at the trial at Manchester Crown Court. \\"We would also like to thank the other witnesses who played a crucial role in assisting us in bringing this dangerous individual to justice.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Tahir Nazir, a 40-year-old man, has been sentenced for a string of sex offences targeting vulnerable young women in various university towns and cities across the UK. Nazir used a fake university ID card to pose as a student and searched the internet for student events to find potential victims. He was eventually caught in Manchester after several female students alerted the police of his suspicious behavior. Following his arrest, DNA analysis linked him to a previous sex attack. Nazir was convicted of multiple charges, including trespass with intent to commit an offence, sexual assault, attempted rape, and three counts of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Is the Caribbean the homeland of both Jean Rhys and Adolfo Bioy Casares? Answer:","output":"Jean Rhys and Adolfo Bioy Casares are notable figures in world literature, each hailing from distinct regions of the world with the Caribbean only being the homeland of one of them. Jean Rhys, originally named Ella Gwendolyn Rees Williams, was indeed born in the Caribbean. She was born on August 24, 1890, in Roseau, the capital city of Dominica, an island nation in the West Indies. Part of the larger group of Caribbean islands, Dominica has rich cultural influences from the Caribbean indigenous people, Africa, and Europe that are reflective in Rhys' works. She is perhaps best known for her novel \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" which is set in Jamaica and Dominica during the 1830s and provides a feminist and anti-colonial response to Charlotte Bronte’s \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Rhys' upbringing in the Caribbean played a significant role in her writing, with her stories often exploring issues such as identity, alienation, and the struggles experienced by women in society - themes that possibly stemmed from her own experiences in Dominica. Her novels, though praised mostly in the latter part of the 20th century, helped shape global perceptions of the rich and complex Caribbean culture and society. Conversely, Adolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, far removed geographically and culturally from the Caribbean. Bioy Casares is a central figure in Argentine literature, well known as a writer and intellectual. He was a collaborator and close friend of Jorge Luis Borges, with their co-authorship producing several classics in Argentine, Latin American, and global literature. One of his most renowned works is \\"The Invention of Morel,\\" a reflection of his interest in immortality, a theme seen throughout his literary pieces. Argentina, specifically Buenos Aires, with its unique fusion of European and Latin American cultures, deeply influenced Bioy Casares' writing. His work often centered on the issues of reality and illusion, concepts that stretch beyond geographical and cultural bounds. In conclusion, the Caribbean is the homeland of Jean Rhys, from where she derived substantial thematic content for her writing. However, the same cannot be said of Adolfo Bioy Casares, who was not from the Caribbean region but from Buenos Aires, Argentina. His upbringing and cultural experiences there significantly influenced his literary contributions. Despite the geographical and cultural differences in their origins, both authors have made indelible marks on literature, with their works continuing to be celebrated and studied globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Biodiversity is the variety of living organisms that make up an ecosystem. It includes all the plants, animals, and microorganisms that live together in an environment.","output":"Helping the forest preserve its diversity is a crucial task in ensuring the health and balance of ecosystems. It strengthens ecosystems, enhancing their resilience and resistance against disturbances such as natural disasters, pests, and diseases. In doing so, biodiversity plays a vital role in supporting human life, providing essential resources like food, medicines, and oxygen, as well as maintaining the Earth's life support systems such as climate regulation, water purification, and nutrient cycling. To contribute to preserving the forest's diversity, several strategies and best practices can be adopted at various levels from individual involvement to collaborative enterprises. Here's a breakdown of the most effective approaches: 1. Public awareness and education: Educate yourself and others about the importance of biodiversity and how human activities can adversely affect it. Encourage community involvement in conserving and regenerating natural habitats. 2. Support sustainable forestry practices: Promote environmentally responsible woodland management and sustainable logging practices. Advocate for certified timber products and paper that come from well-managed forests. 3. Protect and restore habitats: Support the establishment of protected areas like national parks and wildlife reserves where natural habitats can be conserved. Participate in restoration projects to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems and reintroduce native species. 4. Invasive species control: Help prevent the spread of invasive species in forests by learning about the impacts of these species and supporting efforts to control or eradicate them. Invasive species can outcompete native species for resources and alter the ecosystem functions. 5. Encourage responsible recreation: Help protect forests by practicing responsible recreational activities such as hiking, camping, and birdwatching. Use existing trails, minimize waste, and avoid disturbing wildlife habitats. 6. Support local communities: Assist local communities that rely on forests for their livelihoods in adopting sustainable practices like agroforestry, non-timber forest products, and ecotourism opportunities. 7. Engage in collaboration and partnerships: Collaborate with environmental organizations, governmental agencies, research institutions, and local communities to implement conservation initiatives, monitor biodiversity, and enforce policies. 8. Foster scientific research: Support scientific research aimed at better understanding forest ecosystems and the dynamics of biodiversity. This research can be invaluable in identifying new species, understanding the relationships between species, and developing effective conservation strategies. 9. Advocate for strong environmental policies: Engage in environmental advocacy urging governments and policymakers to adopt and enforce strict environmental regulations that protect forests and their biodiversity. 10. Financial and technical assistance: Contribute to conservation efforts financially or by providing expertise in relevant fields such as ecology, forestry, wildlife management, and environmental policy. Each individual's involvement, either through direct action or by advocating for responsible practices, contributes to the preservation of forest diversity. By taking these steps, we will not only be ensuring the health of our ecosystems but also securing the quality of life for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If a catholic had a civil marriage with a non catholic, can she now marry a catholic in church without getting a civil divorce? Can a Maronite Catholic marry a civil divorced non catholic single mother? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same information but are related to Catholic marriages and rules about marrying someone who has been in a previous marriage. 1. A Catholic who had a civil marriage with a non-Catholic might not be considered as valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church if they didn't get permission from the Church. In this case, she might be able to marry a Catholic in the Church without getting a civil divorce. However, if her previous marriage is considered valid by the Church, then she will need to get a civil divorce and an annulment, which means that the Church investigates and declares the previous marriage was never valid. 2. A Maronite Catholic, who is also part of the Catholic Church with some different traditions, can marry a civil divorced non-Catholic single mother as long as the Church grants permission.

Information:  - Wallace Markfield (August 12, 1926  May 24, 2002) was an American comic novelist best known for his first novel, \\"To an Early Grave\\" (1964), about four men who spend the day driving across Brooklyn to their friend's funeral. He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\".  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television .  - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays.  - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.  - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others.  - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s.  - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014).  - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\".  - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode.  - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well.   - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".  - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.  - In theatre, a monologue (from , from  \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and  \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.  - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979.  - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\".  - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\". He immediately became a key cast member in the debut season of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", where his recurring \\"Weekend Update\\" segment soon became a staple of the show.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - Sidney Arthur Lumet (; June 25, 1924  April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for \\"12 Angry Men\\" (1957), \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (1975), \\"Network\\" (1976) and \\"The Verdict\\" (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as \\"Network\\", which was nominated for ten, winning four.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield.   - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.  - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show.  - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession.  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

Given the following passage  \\"The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person John accuses of using him? ?  En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg.  When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there. The cynical Fiske unexpectedly offers to stay with her, but when he asks her what he is to her, she tells him, \\"you're nothing at all, just nothing.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person John accuses of using him is Fuller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the dad who said, \\"What's this?\\" to which Julian replied, \\"it's Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian  ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed...

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Betty has always been proactive when it comes to taking care of her health and well-being. She was always a firm believer in prevention being better than cure and saw the value in regularly consulting with medical professionals to ensure that she was in the best possible health. On the other hand, Natalie never had a significant interest in attending checkups or consulting with doctors. She often found herself feeling uneasy about the whole process, questioning the utility of such visits, and wondering if the cost and time spent were worth it. The two friends had often discussed their differing perspectives on the matter. Betty would explain the comfort and reassurance that came with knowing a medical expert was tracking her health, helping her to catch any potential issues early on, and providing guidance on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. She felt that her regular checkups were a critical component of her self-care routine and appreciated the peace of mind that they provided. Meanwhile, Natalie would counter by arguing that she believed in trusting her own instincts and did not like the idea of placing her health in someone else's hands. She felt that she knew her body better than anyone else and could sense when something was wrong, relying on her intuition to guide her when making decisions about her health. While Natalie appreciated Betty's perspective, she couldn't help but feel skeptical about whether regular doctor visits and consultations were truly helping Betty or just creating a false sense of security. Despite their contrasting views on the matter, the two friends still managed to maintain a deep bond and respect for each other's personal choices. They both recognized the importance of staying true to their ideals and making independent decisions that aligned with their own needs and desires. In the end, Betty continued attending her doctor's appointments, both out of habit and genuine appreciation for the advice and guidance that medical professionals provided. She was aware of the latest information about health issues and concerns, which made her feel confident about her choices and allowed her to stay ahead of any potential problems. This proactive approach to health helped her forge a lifestyle that suited her interests while giving her the sense of security and control she desired. On the other hand, Natalie maintained her independence and continued to listen to her body and trusted in her own ability to discern her health-related needs. She remained cautious and attentive, making lifestyle adjustments and seeking medical guidance whenever she deemed it necessary. While her approach differed from Betty's, it was the one that resonated more profoundly with her values and beliefs. Both women genuinely believed that their approach to healthcare was the right one.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A. To compare it with a well-known matter he selected water. He labeled it as matter B. He also selected ice, which he labeled as matter C. He is now better prepared to compare their states.  But I can use this background: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  What is an answer for this question: Which would have higher density, matter B or matter C? The answer to this question is:","output":"Matter B, which is water in its liquid state, would have a higher density than Matter C, which is ice. The reason for this difference in density lies primarily in the hydrogen bonding present in water molecules. In the liquid state (Matter B), water molecules are closely packed and constantly moving, forming and breaking hydrogen bonds. This results in a denser arrangement of molecules. When water freezes into ice (Matter C), the hydrogen bonds between water molecules become more stable and form an open, hexagonal lattice structure. This structure leads to an increase in the distance between water molecules, causing the overall volume to increase while the mass remains the same. As a result, the density (mass/volume) of the ice decreases, making it less dense than liquid water. This property of water is unique and essential for the survival of aquatic life in cold climates. The lower density of ice allows it to float on liquid water, creating an insulating barrier that helps to protect and maintain the temperature of the water beneath it. This enables organisms like fish to survive even when the surface of a lake or pond freezes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Our special seasonal Noosa Pumpkin yoghurt is a “hats off” to this beaut of a traditional dessert. Natural pumpkin puree, warm, rich spices, and our famously thick and velvety yoghurt—it’s a sweet, spicy holiday shindig for your tastebuds. ||||| Chicago, September 22, 2015 — It’s that time a year again for falling leaves, football games, and the annual tradition of limited-time offer (LTO) pumpkin specialty drinks. Turns out that it’s one of the favorite times of the year for foodservice operators who offer the limited time drinks because their business benefits in more ways than one, reports The NPD Group, a leading global information company.      The seasonal beverage offers can spur additional purchases by established customers, bring in new customers, draw customers from competitors, and stimulate business during slow periods, according to research from NPD’s Checkout Tracking™, which harvests receipts from more than 35,000 diners to track consumer purchase behavior. An analysis of the purchase cycle of pumpkin spice latte buyers reveals that these lattes are likely considered to be an “indulgent�? purchase, and the vast majority of these purchasers, 72 percent, did so just once. About 20 percent of pumpkin spice latte customers purchased the item twice, and about 8 percent made three or more purchases during the offer period.      In addition to increasing visits and visit frequency, seasonal beverages also produce higher checks, NPD found. During fall and winter 2014, the average check for pumpkin latte buyers was 7.81, compared with 6.67 for non-buyers. Similarly, the average check for buyers of a white mocha, another popular seasonal beverage, was 8.37, compared with just 6.84 for non-buyers. Consumers’ purchase of food items in addition to the beverage contributed to the higher check average, according to the Checkout Tracking analysis.      To determine the impact of limited-time offers on visit frequency, NPD also examined the purchase cycle of a seasonal shake offer at another major chain. The data revealed that these shake purchasers tended to be the restaurant’s most loyal customers, with higher purchase frequency rates, especially during the promotional period. Shake buyers made 5.7 visits in the two-month period before the limited-time offer, and then made an additional visit during the limited-time offer period. Meanwhile non-shake buyers made only 4.7 visits prior to the promotion and 4.4 visits during the limited-time offer.      “Considering the battle for traffic share in the restaurant industry, it’s critical to offer unique, craveable menu items that attract both new customers and keep current ones coming back,�? says Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst. “For the restaurant operator, seasonal beverages have a positive impact on visit frequency and check averages as consumers tend to purchase food along with the seasonal beverage. It doesn’t get much better than that.�?      Related Press Releases |||||","output":"Seasonal limited-time offer (LTO) beverages have a strong positive impact on the foodservice industry, generating more visits and higher spend, according to The NPD Group's Checkout Tracking.

Most people consider pumpkin spice lattes an indulgent buy, with 72% only purchasing them once. LTO drinks can also increase check averages. During fall and winter 2014, the average check for pumpkin latte buyers was 7.81, compared with 6.67 for non-buyers. This trend also holds for other seasonal beverages. The potential for attracting new customers and keeping regulars coming back is crucial to foodservice businesses, especially considering the competitive nature of the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: (i). see the view. (ii). go to sleep. (iii). looked out the window for the flight. The answer is:","output":"Aubrey chose to sit by the window in the airplane so they could look out the window. Based on the available information, we can analyze the possible reasons behind Aubrey's decision. (i). See the view: One of the most likely reasons for Aubrey's choice of a window seat is to enjoy the view outside the airplane. Many travelers prefer window seats to marvel at the vast expanses of the sky, the clouds, and the Earth from above. This unique perspective offers passengers a visual treat, allowing them to witness breathtaking sceneries, sunrises, and sunsets that can only be experienced from high altitudes. Additionally, observing the ground below while taking off and landing is a thrilling experience for many. (ii). Go to sleep: Although going to sleep might not be the primary motive for Aubrey to sit by the window, it could be a secondary consideration. A window seat in an airplane provides passengers with some extra space to lean against, offering them greater comfort when trying to sleep on a flight, especially during long-haul journeys. Furthermore, a window seat also minimizes the number of times Aubrey may be disturbed by other passengers who need to access the aisle for walking or restroom breaks. (iii). Looked out the window for the flight: This option is likely a restatement of the main context. Since Aubrey wanted to sit by the window so they could look out, it is implied that they wanted to gaze out during the flight, which could include seeing the view and simply enjoying the visual stimulus of observing the surroundings. Based on the context provided and the available options, the answer is most likely: (i) see the view. This reason not only aligns with the context that Aubrey wanted to look out the window during the flight, but it also provides a specific and substantial reason why passengers enjoy window seats in an airplane, which is to take in the stunning views from thousands of feet above the ground."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Edwin Washington Edwards (born August 7, 1927) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 7th congressional district from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th Governor of Louisiana for four terms (1972-1980, 1984-1988 and 1992-1996), twice as many elected terms as any other Louisiana chief executive. He served a total of 16 years in office, the sixth-longest serving gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days. A colorful, powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who has been dubbed the \\"very last of the line of New Deal Southern Democrats\\", was long dogged by charges of corruption. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering charges and sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. Both in his political rhetoric and in his public persona, Edwards cast himself as a Louisiana populist in the tradition of Huey P. Long and Earl K. Long. He was inaugurated as governor on May 9. One of his first acts was to call for a constitutional convention to overhaul Louisiana's bulky charter. Many of the sections on state government were written by delegate Robert G. Pugh, a prominent Shreveport attorney, who became an advisor to Edwards and two other governors thereafter. Voters approved the new constitution by a three-to-two margin in 1974, and government reorganization resulted. For the first time Louisiana operated with a \\"cabinet style\\" executive department in lieu of the hundreds of boards and commissions that had existed for decades, each its own fiefdom.  During his first two terms in office, Edwards developed a reputation for being one of the most colorful and flamboyant politicians in the history of a state known for its unorthodox political figures. Charismatic, well-dressed, and quick with clever one-liners and retorts, Edwards maintained wide popularity.  On taking office, Edwards hired J. Kelly Nix as his executive assistant and in 1974 elevated him to first executive assistant. In the second term, however, Nix left the administration to take office as the Louisiana state school superintendent. Dale Thorn, who had been Edwards' press secretary while he was in Congress, continued in that position for the first and most of the second Edwards terms. He was later associate commissioner of higher education for the Louisiana Board of Regents, and an LSU journalism professor.  Edwards also depended heavily on state Senator Sixty Rayburn of Bogalusa, whose 44-year service earned him the sobriquet as \\"Dean of the Louisiana Senate.\\" He also rewarded political friends, such as former legislative colleague Fred L. Schiele, whom he appointed in 1973 to succeed the embattled Noah W. Cross as sheriff of Concordia Parish in eastern Louisiana.  Under Edwards, Michael H. O'Keefe of New Orleans in 1976 was named president of the state Senate, an office that was held by the lieutenant governor prior to the implementation of the state Constitution of 1974. In 1983, as Edwards prepared to return to office, O'Keefe was engulfed in scandal and forced to leave the Senate. He was as replaced by the Edwards loyalist, Samuel B. Nunez Jr., of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish. In 2013, O'Keefe was still serving time in prison for a 1999 conviction.  Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that \\"It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.\\" He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called \\"One Edwards Square\\" (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas. Later, Edwards' commissioner of administration Charles Roemer - father of future governor Buddy Roemer - was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case.  During the governor's first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named Clyde Vidrine made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine's credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called Just Takin' Orders, which included salacious details of Edwards' frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife.  In a 1976 scandal known as Koreagate, it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. South Korean rice broker Tongsun Park was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing 10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was \\"super moralistic\\" for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards's former congressional colleague Otto Passman of Monroe, who was later acquitted of all charges in the case.  Edwards was the issue of the campaign. Because of his name recognition, his resilient supporters, and unmatched political skill, even a weakened Edwards could safely assume he would win a place in Louisiana's unique primary election system runoff. The question was whether his opponent in the runoff would be someone who could beat him.  There was a prevailing sense in the race that Edwards needed Livingston in the runoff. Livingston was a Republican in a state that had at that point elected only one Republican governor since Reconstruction. And Livingston was widely perceived as lacking in charisma and personality, which would work to Edwards's advantage. Any other opponent, a moderate Democrat without the ethical problems, would be dangerous. To that end, Edwards talked up Livingston. Perhaps the key moment in the 1987 race came at a forum between the candidates. As usual, the main topic of discussion was Edwin Edwards. His challengers were asked, in succession, if they would consider endorsing Edwards in the general election if they did not make it to the runoff. The candidates hedged, particularly Secretary of State Brown, a reliable Edwards supporter in the state Senate who in his 1979 election drew many of the same voters who supported fellow Democrat Louis Lambert in his failed gubernatorial bid in the same general election vs. Treen. The last candidate to speak was Buddy Roemer: \\"No, we've got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards.\\" The next day, as political commentator John Maginnis put it, Jim Brown was explaining his statement while Buddy Roemer was ordering \\"Slay the Dragon\\" buttons. Boosted by his endorsement as the 'good government candidate' by nearly every newspaper in the state, Roemer stormed from last place in the polls and on election night, overtook Edwin Edwards and placed first in the primary election, with 33 percent of the vote compared with Edwards' 28 percent. This marked the first time Edwin Edwards ever finished other than in first place in an election.  In what seemed to be the end of Edwards' political career, the governor withdrew from the contest in his concession speech, automatically electing Buddy Roemer governor. In fact, he was cleverly setting a trap for Roemer. By withdrawing, Edwards denied Roemer the opportunity to build a governing coalition in the general election race, and denied him the decisive majority victory that he surely would have attained. In one stroke, Edwards made Buddy Roemer a minority governor. Also, Edwards virtually ceded control of the state to Roemer even before his inauguration. By doing so, he passed on the burden of the state's problems to the new governor, who was essentially under the gun even before assuming office. For four years, Roemer struggled to be a reform governor of Louisiana as so many had before him. And although virtually no one realized it at the time, Edwin Edwards quietly waited in the wings for a return to power.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the important of anyone but Edwards?","output":"The importance of \\"anyone but Edwards\\" was that it showed a strong desire for change and for a candidate who was not associated with the corruption and scandals that had plagued Edwin Edwards' time in office. Buddy Roemer's statement, \\"No, we've got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards,\\" demonstrated his commitment to breaking away from the old ways of Louisiana politics and bringing about reform. This stance resonated with voters, helping Roemer gain momentum and eventually win the election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The translated English version of \\"Gaz précurseurs dont on sait qu'ils causent la formation d'aérosols organiques secondaires.\\" is \\"Precursor gases that are known to cause the formation of secondary organic aerosols.\\" Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are formed in the atmosphere through complex reaction pathways involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight. These aerosols are a component of particulate matter, sometimes covering a significant fraction, and have implications for global climate as well as human health. In simple terms, SOAs are tiny particles that float in the air and are composed of organic molecules. Natural processes, like plant emissions, contribute to the formation of SOAs, but human activities, such as burning of fossil fuels and industrial emissions, are also significant sources. Precursors to these SOAs are typically 'gaseous' organic compounds, which are transformed into aerosols by oxidative processes driven by sunlight, with the help of other compounds in the atmosphere. Different volatile organic compounds can become precursors for SOA formation depending largely on their volatility and their reactivity in the atmosphere. Common VOCs that are known to yield SOAs include isoprene (emitted from trees), monoterpenes (also from trees), and aromatics (from human activities). The term 'precursor gases' refers to these volatile organic compounds that can undergo chemical reactions, leading to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. The process begins when these gaseous compounds are released into the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, these gases can be oxidized by common atmospheric oxidants, these gaseous precursors undergo a series of chemical transformations driven by solar radiation, causing reactant VOC molecules to cluster together and condense, forming aerosols. These aerosols play a key role in the Earth's radiation balance because they can scatter and absorb solar radiation as well as act as the condensation nuclei for cloud droplets. For these reasons, understanding the nature of these precursor gases and the formation of secondary organic aerosols is necessary for scientists trying to understand climate change and air quality issues."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: The input is a tweet which can be classified as Hate Speech, Offensive or Normal.

Write a summary based on this article: Syrians in Jordan are taking an interest in attending sports clubs to learn to swim as they prepare to undertake the journey to seek refuge by sea.            “Sharif,” the owner of a sports venue, has noticed high demand among many Syrian refugees for attending the clubs, with their activities limited to taking swimming lessons. After speaking with some of them, he learned the reason was that some of them wanted to try to immigrate by sea.            “Usually we close the pool during winter, but considering that so many have registered for swimming lessons, and that most of them are Syrian refugees, we kept the classes open,” Sharif said.            The owner of a private pool, who asked that his name not be published, said: “We receive the men in one period and the women in another period. Since I’m in charge of registering participants in the swimming courses, I noticed that entire families were signing up. The father would come with the sons, and the mother would come with the daughters. We also had a few elderly people.”            An official in another sports club said the issue had not drawn his attention at first, and he did not think about why there was such high demand among refugees registering for swimming lessons. But after speaking with them, it became clear to him that they were trying to plan their journey by sea to seek refuge abroad.      One refugee did not deny his intent to travel by sea, or that he was trying to learn to swim to try to reduce the risks of the journey, despite knowing that simply learning to swim would not save him if the boat were to sink.            The young man, Mohammed, said: “It never occurred to me that one day I might think of putting my life in danger, but two reasons encouraged me to take this step. First, many have survived, and second, the life I live now is like death, because it has no future.”      This article was translated and edited by The Syrian Observer. Responsibility for the information and views set out in this article lies entirely with the author. ||||| ---      Swimming pools and sports centres in Jordan are seeing an increase in demand for lessons as Syrian refugees prepare to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing to Europe.      The Syrian Observer, a website which gathers and translates language news from several sides of the conflict, says that anti-government outlet Al-Madar al-Youm reports that one sports centre owner, Sharif, said he noticed the surge in interest and after talking to customers realised it was because some people were planning on trying to get to Europe by sea.      More than 300,000 people are thought to have relied on the mercy of people smugglers, unseaworthy vessels and good weather to arrive on beaches in Turkey and Greece in 2015 alone.      At least 6,000 people are estimated to have died making the crossing since the beginning of 2014. More than 400 people have died so far in 2016.      Sharif told Al-Madar al-Youm:      Usually we close the pool during winter, but considering that so many have registered for swimming lessons, and that most of them are Syrian refugees, we kept the classes open.      Another pool owner said that entire families are signing up for lessons, with mothers taking daughters and fathers taking sons to segregated lessons. Some elderly people have also been learning.      A young man called Mohammed the group spoke to said he knew that if a boat sank, learning to swim would not be enough to save him.

More than 300,000 refugees and migrants have used the dangerous sea route across the Mediterranean so far this year. © UNHCR/A. McConnell      GENEVA, Aug 28 (UNHCR) - More than 300,000 refugees and migrants have used the dangerous sea route across the Mediterranean so far this year with almost 200,000 of them landing in Greece and a further 110,000 in Italy.      The UN refugee agency, revealing the latest statistics in Geneva on Friday, said this represents a large increase from last year, when around 219,000 people crossed the Mediterranean during the whole of 2014.      \\"At the same time, some 2,500 refugees and migrants are estimated to have died or gone missing this year, trying to reach Europe. This death toll does not include yesterday's tragedy off Libya where numbers of deaths are still unconfirmed,\\" UNHCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming told a press briefing in Geneva.      Last year some 3,500 people died or were reported missing in the Mediterranean Sea.      Fleming said that despite the concerted efforts of the joint European search and rescue operation under FRONTEX, which has saved tens of thousands of lives this year, the Mediterranean Sea continues to be the \\"deadliest route for refugees and migrants\\".      She added that in the last few days, even more people had lost their lives in three separate incidents.      The Libyan Coast Guard carried two rescue operations on Thursday morning, seven miles off the port town of Zwara. Two boats carrying an approximate total of 500 refugees and migrants were intercepted and survivors taken to shore in Libya.      \\"An estimated 200 people are still missing and feared dead. A still undetermined number of bodies were recovered and taken to shore. The Libyan Red Crescent has been helping with the collection of the bodies,\\" Fleming added.      On Wednesday (26 August), rescuers coming to the aid of another boat off the Libyan coast found 51 people dead from suffocation in the hold.      \\"According to survivors, smugglers were charging people money for allowing them to come out of the hold in order to breathe,\\" Fleming detailed.      She quoted one survivor, Abdel, 25, from Sudan as saying: \\"We didn't want to go down there but they beat us with sticks to force us. We had no air so we were trying to get back up through the hatch and to breathe through the cracks in the ceiling. But the other passengers were scared the boat would capsize so they pushed us back down and beat us too. Some were stamping on our hands.\\"      Fleming said that last week (15 August), the bodies of 49 persons were found in the hold of another boat in a similar but separate incident. They are thought to have died after inhaling poisonous fumes.      Also that week, a rubber dinghy carrying some 145 refugees and migrants ran into trouble when the person steering it made a manoeuvre that caused the dinghy to tilt dangerously to one side.      \\"Some people fell into the sea and two men jumped into the water to rescue them. Panic ensued and people began to jostle and shove and, as a result, three women were crushed to death on the dinghy,\\" Fleming said.      Of those who fell in the water, 18 are still missing and believed to have drowned. The survivors were rescued and taken to Lampedusa, including a two-month old baby of one of the women who died. Most of the survivors are reported to be in a critical condition, suffering from shock, cuts and bruises.      Many of the people arriving by sea in southern Europe, particularly in Greece, come from countries affected by violence and conflict, such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan; they are in need of international protection and they are often physically exhausted and psychologically traumatized.      UNHCR appeals to all governments involved to provide comprehensive responses and act with humanity and in accordance with their international obligations.      All European countries and the EU must act together in response to the growing emergency and demonstrate responsibility and solidarity.

Movie title: Ferdinand the Bull Movie plot: In the beginning, there are a lot of bulls, romping around together and butting their heads. There was only one bull who wasn't doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange-looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bullfight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out banderilleros, picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The banderilleros and picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff because Ferdinand was so big and strong. But Ferdinand looked up in the stands and saw all of the beautiful hats that the women were wearing, each decorated with lovely, fragrant flowers. He couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful hats. The matador was very angry that Ferdinand wasn't charging at him. But Ferdinand was not interested in fighting; he was only interested in admiring the beautiful flowers....

The Iberians (Latin: Hiberi, from Greek: Iberes, Iberes) were a set of peoples that Greek and Roman sources (among others, Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienus, Herodotus and Strabo) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula, at least from the 6th century BC. The Roman sources also use the term Hispani to refer to the Iberians. The term Iberian, as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans). The Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region.  The Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity \\"Betatun\\" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a \\"horse taming god\\" or \\"lord of the horses\\" (despotes hippon). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions.  Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the \\"Bastetania dance\\" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common.  The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs.  Iberians venerated the war god Cariociecus. What other interesting things can you tell me?","output":"The Iberians, a diverse set of pre-Roman peoples, had rich and varied cultural aspects that make their history quite fascinating. Some additional interesting features of the Iberian culture include: 1. Language and Writing System: The Iberians spoke a variety of languages, which were part of the larger Iberian languages group. Their writing system, called Iberian script, was primarily used in the eastern and southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. There were two main variants of the Iberian script: Northeastern Iberian and Southeastern Iberian scripts. The Iberian scripts remain partially undeciphered, although some progress has been made in understanding their content. 2. Trade and Economy: Iberians had a flourishing trade economy, especially along the coastal regions where they interacted with Greeks, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians. They exchanged locally produced goods like metals, wine, and textiles for goods from other cultures. Iberians were skilled workers in metalworking, pottery, and textiles and were known for their silver and iron ore mining. 3. Political Structure: The Iberians had a tribal-based political organization, with each tribe having its own central settlement known as an oppidum. The oppida functioned as a fortified city or town that housed the ruling elites, religious sites, and key workshops. The Iberians had both monarchy and aristocratic ruling systems. 4. Warfare and Military: The Iberians were prominent warriors known for their courage and ferocity in battles. They employed various types of weapons such as the falcata, a curved sword, and long-range weapons like the soliferrum, a heavy throwing spear. The Iberians were historically recorded for their military prowess and defensive strategies. For example, during the Second Punic War (218 – 201 BC), the Iberians fought both alongside and against Carthaginians and Romans. 5. Art and Music: Iberian art was characterized by a fusion of local elements and influences from external sources such as Greeks, Phoenicians, and Celts. Iberian art, mainly seen in pottery, sculptures, and cave paintings provide valuable insights into their rituals, daily lives, and religious beliefs. Music and dance was an important aspect of their religious and daily life, as evidenced by paintings and sculptures depicting musicians and dancers. Iberians also produced various musical instruments, including different types of flutes and lyres. Studying the Iberians helps us understand a crucial era of human history that contributed to the development of modern European societies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (lycées) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France. All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages. Unlike the system during the Ancien Régime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface.  - Pseudolabrus is a genus of wrasses native to the eastern Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean .  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\".  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.

Write highlights for this article: The resilience of a burned baby golden eagle that survived a Utah wildfire is astounding wildlife rehabilitators nursing him back to health. \\"The trauma and the injury and the situation he is in -- to come out of it is amazing,\\" said DaLyn Erickson, executive director of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah in Ogden. All of the eaglet's feathers, even on his head, were charred. He also suffered burns to the feet and around his beak. His improbable story began June 1, when a volunteer who documents eagles placed a band on the bird. The Dump Fire erupted three weeks later, burning more than 5,500 acres south of Salt Lake City and west of Utah Lake. Kent Keller returned in late June to the nest, built on the edge of the cliff, thinking he would recover the band from a deceased animal. The nest on Lake Mountain was gone, the rocks behind it blackened by the blaze. Keller then spotted legs and talons near a scorched juniper below. Amazingly, the baby eagle was alive. Near him were rabbit and squirrel carcasses, evidence his parents had tried to feed him after disaster struck. Fortunately, his eyes had not been burned. Wildfire victims face second tragedy. Keller said he has thought of the horror the helpless nestling might have felt when flames approached. \\"He had enough courage to jump from that nest and try to save himself anyway,\\" said Keller, 56, who describes himself as an amateur ornithologist. \\"He is a real fighter.\\" The fall was about 25 feet, and the eagle probably walked back to the base of the cliff after rolling another 100 feet, said Keller. The bird remained in the area for several days while Keller, who is authorized to band raptors, sought permission from federal and state authorities to obtain care for him. On Wednesday, Keller handed the bird over to Erickson. She and her staff dubbed the survivor \\"Phoenix\\" -- a reference to the mythical creature that is reborn from the ashes. There was no food in the craw of the dehydrated eagle, which weighed just over 5 pounds. \\"He was lethargic and just obviously hurting,\\" Erickson told CNN on Saturday. \\"After we got him hydrated and medications, he perked up and that fire came back in him.\\" Erickson said Phoenix, now about 70 days old, was a handful Saturday, lunging and using his talons as caregivers fed and provided antibiotics to the animal. \\"He's not grateful,\\" she quipped. Rehabilitators limit their contact with the eagle so that he will not \\"habituate,\\" or become too comfortable around people. They use hydrotherapy to help the healing in his feet. \\"He needs those for hunting. There are lots of tendons and muscles we need to protect,\\" said Erickson. Golden eagles, which are protected, typically eat reptiles, birds and small mammals, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They also are known to scavenge carrion. Colorado's most destructive fire nears containment. Keller said golden eagle females are slightly smaller than the more-famous bald eagle and tend to hunt more and scavenge less. Their particular favorite prey in northern Utah is the black-tailed jackrabbit. The resident of suburban Salt Lake City studies golden eagles and provides population information to state wildlife authorities. Erickson called Keller \\"the hero in this story.\\" It's too early to tell whether Phoenix will be able to fly in the wild. Rehabilitation will take at least a year and his feathers won't fully molt until mid-2013. \\"We are fairly confident, but there could be follicle damage we do not know about that would prevent feathers from coming in,\\" Erickson said. The nonprofit center, which treats about 1,800 animals a year, is accepting financial and food donations to offset the cost of caring for the golden eagle. \\"He is doing well and we are very positive about his outcome right now,\\" said Erickson. \\"(But) these types of things can turn at any moment.\\" How to donate.

Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance.  George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\".  Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses.  On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga.  Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew.  Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way.  The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished.  At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort.  The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site.  The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.

The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100.

When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

This will typically be a separate track in your software. Depending on how fast or slow you want the song to be, the speed of the click can be divided into halves, thirds, or quarters. You can experiment if you’re unsure.  The click track will help to ensure that with all of the copy and pasting you’ll do, the song stays on tempo. Your tempo will vary according to the mood and style of the song, and is typically between 80 and 120. More likely than not, you'll turn the click track off once you have a basic beat made -- this is just a guide right now to keep you on tempo. The drums are your backbone, providing the structure that all other instruments fall on. They usually come first. That said, you don't have to use drums for percussion -- gunshots, car doors slamming, synth blasts, pots and pans, and much more have been used to provide rhythm in songs of all genres.  Hip-hop beats have a classic trio -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. That's it. Check out DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena for a classic example.  You can download drum packs, which are recordings of different percussion sounds, to use in your songs for free online. Search the drums you want on a search engine, like \\"Steel Drum Sounds Pack,\\" or \\"Led Zeppelin Drum Sample Pack.\\" Together, the bass and drums form the rhythm section of every song. While the drums set the tempo and beat, the bass locks into this rhythm and hints at the melody, often with simple, danceable lines. There are many songs that are almost all drums and bass -- so don't disregard the bass because it is harder to hear in the final mix -- it's the instrument that gets people dancing.  Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \\"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\\" or complex, like Common's \\"Be (Intro).\\" A bass line doesn't need a bass guitar, though they help. Listen to what Daft Punk is able to do with deep synthesizers for another example. Your bass line and kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) should mesh for the maximum effect. Most producers like to have them alternating. The bass and the drums should be unique to make your song unique. Still, the melody line is where most songs come to their own and become new, big beats. Build melodies around your mood, using synths and electronic sounds for EDM or techno music, horns and guitars for R&B, even odd \\"found sounds\\" from weird sources (see \\"Windows Media Player\\" by Charles Hamilton for an example). The possibilities are endless. Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. Looping is taking at least one bar of music, like a drum line, and repeating it flawlessly so it sounds like the drummer is playing the exact same thing the whole song. You can, and should, loop everything -- making the perfect smaller section and then dragging it out to save time and get the perfect tempo for your entire beat. Great loops don't feel like loops -- they perfectly come back around so it sounds like a real musician is playing the instrument over and over again. A straight beat is great. But most songs are made up of several related beats, each coming together to provide excitement and movement. The new beats, however, are almost always closely related. Some ideas for breakdowns and changes include:   Add a new melody line: A new sample, some brief vocals, or the re-emerging melody line usually signals a \\"chorus\\" or sing-along section of the beat. This is usually the most memorable part of the beat.  Drop to a minimal beat: Dropping to just drums and bass, or even just drums, is a great way to lower the energy. You can then blast the beat back to pump the song back up and get the crowd really moving.  Building and dropping: Add volume, new instruments, and drums to grow tension and energy, then drop out to a big, bassy, and danceable section. These are more nebulous concepts of music composition, and every producer has different preferences. No matter what you choose, think about these three concepts to make interesting, layered beats.   Tension: Found in juxtaposition, tension is what pulls the song forward.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.

Gunmen launched grenades and used machetes against Muslims being evacuated in a truck convoy in Central African Republic, killing at least three children and 19 adults, a humanitarian group said Saturday. At least 23 more people, including children, were injured in Friday's attack and were being treated in a hospital in Bouar, in the northwestern part of the country, said Michael McCusker with Save the Children in Bangui, the nation's capital. The African country has been wracked with such serious religious and ethnic violence, including between Muslims and Christians, that the United Nations has said it fears a genocide could be brewing, and aid groups warn of a humanitarian crisis. The convoy was carrying mostly Muslim families from the village of Vakap when a grenade was launched into the trucks, said officials with Save the Children, a U.K.-based aid group. Attackers hacked many victims with machetes, the group said. Nearly a million flee violence. The mostly Muslim families in the convoy were being evacuated from violence and were ultimately destined for refuge in neighboring Cameroon. \\"It is a sign of the still fraught and highly dangerous situation in the Central African Republic that children and their families have been attacked and killed while trying to evacuate to safety,\\" said Robert Lankenau, the group's director in the country. The Bouar hospital treats both Christians and Muslims, the group said. Security has deteriorated since the country's interim leaders, President Michel Djotodia and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, announced their resignation at a regional summit in Chad this month. Chaos struck the Central African Republic last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, the latest in a series of coups since its independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, then became interim president in a coup. Since then, political turmoil and violence has spread. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition. To counter the attacks on their communities, Christians assembled vigilante groups and fought back. The violence prompted U.N. fears about a genocide brewing. Children beheaded as violence grows. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence, and some 958,000 more people, many of them children, have been forced from their homes within the Central African Republic, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR. There are also more than 86,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo who fled the Central African Republic in 2013, the UNHCR said Friday. Some 100,000 people have gathered at a makeshift camp by the international airport in Bangui, seeking refuge from the violence.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance.

Let's solve this step by step, like pieces of a puzzle. Our puzzle is: 2595 + 225 - 247 = -542*c - 679 First, let's solve the left side of the equation: 2595 (two thousand, five hundred ninety-five) + 225 (two hundred twenty-five) = 2820 (two thousand, eight hundred twenty) Now subtract 247 (two hundred forty-seven) from 2820 (two thousand, eight hundred twenty): 2820 - 247 = 2573 (two thousand, five hundred seventy-three) Now our puzzle looks like this: 2573 = -542*c - 679 Next, let's move the -679 (negative six hundred seventy-nine) to the other side. To do that, we add 679 to both sides: 2573 + 679 = -542*c Now, add those numbers on the left side: 2573 + 679 = 3252 (three thousand, two hundred fifty-two) So now our puzzle is: 3252 = -542*c Lastly, let's find the value of \\"c\\". We can do that by dividing 3252 (three thousand, two hundred fifty-two) by -542 (negative five hundred forty-two): 3252 ÷ -542 = c Once we divide, we find that: c = -6 (negative six) So, the final answer to the puzzle is c = -6.

Next time I'll setup a website dedicated to this scam.  When my kids are teasing each other and their friends \\"would you rather kiss a pig or eat at Jou00ebl Robuchon\\" even zero stars would be too many.  I'm not sure how anyone in their right mind would give this place 5 stars unless they just want to pretend that they went to an awesome place that no mere mortal will afford and can't discover the truth.  We didn't mind paying just to see the place and experience supposedly the best food by the chef of the century, but the whole deal was a 4-hour ceremony during which a few classy butlers pretend to give you something to eat while you're supposed to pretend that it's good. Literally each and every course was the size of a scallop with one of the courses actually being exactly one scallop and another one a mashroom. If brought together at once the total size of the 16-course meal would be smaller than a kids meal at any other restaurant. Adding to the insult was that most of these items were inedible, we came home hungry and just warmed up whatever we found in our fridge.  Let's start with the look: the place looks simply tacky with its classical decor mismatched to the partially modern ceiling, the oversized chandelier overpowering the small room, the purple sofas that seem to be bought from Hugh Heffner, and cheap looking fake plastic diamonds sprinkled on the dining tables. But that's forgivable given that we came here to eat, not to admire the settings.  We decided on two of the 16-course 385 meals which was recommended by so many other reviewers, assuming that our two kids will also taste some dishes. First, the butler brings a large block of butter and shaves a few pieces onto a plate while explaining that the butter is from Great Britain. Then he brings a large cart with selection of 16 different breads, which look and smell great but you can't really eat them because they ask you to select a few kinds and when you point to the 3 or 4 that look most interesting they drop one small slice of each on your table and quickly haul the cart away. You won't see it again. You then spread the English butter onto the bread to find out that the butter tastes just like any butter, whether from Guatemalan or a local cow. The bread itself was quite good and possibly one of the best items of the evening, however, you can go down to the M Resort buffet and get as much of the similar and better breads as you want and keep coming back for more. Here with the bread we also got a small portion of caviar on top of rolled crab meat. The caviar must've been the most expensive tasteless item we had there, but the canned crab meat was decent. The next couple courses included another outrageously expensive and highly sought item: shaved truffles. We were trying to discover what's so distinct about them but the only thing we discovered was taste of a shaved tree bark, actually looking just like that as well. Of course we have never tasted a tree bark before but we could imagine that it'd taste just like these truffles. The rest of the weird dishes included a tiny frog leg, a scallop, and other Lilliput size items, the worse being bacon foam that tasted just like warm whipped fat from the bacon - something so awful it should've been offered in a food eating competition on CBS Survivor. After spending 3.5 hours at this torturous ceremony we finally arrived at the end of the tunnel as the butler brought a desert cart filled with variety of chocolates and cake pieces. Although each one was the size of 5 stacked up pennies we already figured out the game and asked for a sample of each. The butler looked at us and said \\"all 40 of them\\"? We all replied \\"Yes!\\" and finally started enjoying ourselves by swallowing each piece while the butler was placing it on the table. Not by any means does this mean that we got what we paid for but at least we had 5 minutes of enjoyment and wished the whole experience was like that. This was also the first time I saw smiles on my kids' faces (aged 8 and 12).  We were prepared to spend around 1000 and the bill was little below 900, so no problem there. Although the fact that our kids were charged 7 for each of the Sprite refills (28 for four) should be noted.  Finally, we were given a bag with small box of dessert pieces and two beautiful certificates of attendance with our names on them and the list of all 16 courses we were supposed to enjoy. We were also given a nice color brochure with pictures of each those items. All this looks pretty, but at the same time embarrassing - like being given a certificate of investing with Madoff. You could show it off only until everyone else figures out that Madoff was a crook.  In the end we will remember this place as one of the worst experiences of our lives and we would not go there again even if the food was free.

After she finished high school, she went to college and studied to be a teacher. After she became a teacher, Dolores noticed that many of her students were not getting enough food to eat. Some of them wore very old clothes. Dolores wondered how she could help them. Dolores decided to stop teaching so that she could spend more time helping the farm workers and their families. One thing she wanted to do was to get more pay for farm workers so they could buy their children the things they needed.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are most buildings heated with?\\" is \\"electromagnetic energy\\", given that  most buildings are heated with turbine generators?","output":"While it is true that electromagnetic energy is involved in the process of generating heat in many buildings, the direct answer to the question \\"what are most buildings heated with?\\" would not be \\"electromagnetic energy.\\" Instead, it would be more accurate to state that most buildings are heated using either natural gas, oil, electricity, or a combination of these sources. Allow me to provide a detailed explanation for better understanding: Natural gas and oil-fired heating systems make use of a furnace or boiler to burn the fuel, generating heat that is then transferred to air or water. This heated air or water is then circulated throughout the building to provide warmth via radiators, baseboard heating, or forced-air systems. And yes, in some cases, turbine generators are used to produce electricity, which is then used for heating purposes. However, these generators are typically powered by natural gas, coal, or nuclear energy. Where electromagnetic energy comes in is when we talk about generating heat using electrical sources like electrical resistance heaters, heat pumps, and electric radiant heaters. When electricity flows through these systems, it generates electromagnetic energy, which then gets converted to heat. However, even in these cases, the main source of heating is still electricity, rather than electromagnetic energy. In conclusion, though electromagnetic energy plays a role in heating systems that utilize electric sources, the most accurate answer to the question would be that most buildings are heated with natural gas, oil, or electricity. The way these sources are converted to heat in different heating systems varies, but listing electromagnetic energy as a primary heating source would be misleading."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang? from the following article ?  ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

Lennon was drinking with Harry Nilsson when the incident occurred."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The character Tom Destry, or simply Destry, was played by James Stewart. Marlene Dietrich also featured prominently in the film as the character Frenchy. This film was actually a comeback for Dietrich and significantly boosted Stewart's career. However, in the given sentence, there is no mention of \\"Destry Rides Again\\" or of James Stewart, and thus it does not answer the question of who played Destry in that specific film. Deanna Durbin and Gloria Jean – the actresses referred to in the sentence – are not associated with the film. Durbin was a Canadian-born actress who enjoyed popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with musical films, and Gloria Jean was a prominent child star at the time.  It's important to note that in the context of Deanna Durbin and Gloria Jean, their career trajectories have a connection with the producer Joe Pasternak, who moved away from producing Durbin's films to working with young Jean on a series of musicals. The sentence then mentions Jean's successful assignments opposite stars like Bing Crosby, W.C Fields, and Donald O'Connor. Still, despite these details about their careers, neither Durbin nor Jean was connected to the film \\"Destry Rides Again\\".

By any measure the opera was a disaster compared to the symphony, as the  Pick from: (A). opera was so lavishly funded.. (B). symphony was so lavishly funded..","output":"B. symphony was so lavishly funded. By any measure, the opera was a disaster compared to the symphony, as the symphony was so lavishly funded. The management had spared no expense in ensuring that every element of the symphony was taken care of, down to the minutest detail. The orchestra had been given the best possible instruments, and they'd invited renowned musicians worldwide to join their ranks. Some of them, like the first-chair violinist and the soloist soprano, had agreed to generous sums to secure their talents. The costumes for the symphony's performers were designed and tailored by the most skilled artisans in the industry, and each piece was adorned with a plethora of exquisite details that would sparkle under the stage lights. The stage itself was host to magnificent backdrops and extravagant props that created an enchanting atmosphere for the audience to step into. The lighting and sound design alone were of the highest quality available, ensuring that each musician could convey their movements and melodies in perfect harmony with one another. In contrast, the opera's production felt bare-boned and lifeless. With a meager budget to work with, the team was left to scrounge for whatever money they could, with neither the management nor the patrons seeing much value in the production – a fact that became apparent upon attending the performances. The costumes, if they could be called that, were made from low-quality materials and barely held together, falling apart at the seams with every step the performers took on stage. The stage set could hardly be compared to the symphony's – minimal at best, consisting of a few painted flats that didn't do much to convince the audience of a different place or time. For the musicians and singers, there were none of the stellar performers the symphony boasted. Instead, they had a ragtag group of undertrained local artists who might have been passionate about their craft but lacked the prestige and skill that their counterparts in the symphony possessed. As the performances unfolded, it was obvious to all but the most oblivious observer that the opera stood little chance of success in the shadow of the spectacular symphony. The audience for the opera was often left wondering what could have been, had they been able to see a production on par with that of the symphony's. The singers and musicians, despite their best efforts, were unable to perform at their fullest potential, hindered as they were by the dire lack of funding and support. Throughout the run, the symphony continued to amass accolades and admiration from local and international critics alike. The opera, on the other hand, limped along for a few more performances before it was shuttered for good. The cast and crew disbanded, the production assets sold off, and the once-promising idea of the opera was relegated to the annals of history. In a world where resources were limited, and where art had to compete against commerce and politics, the symphony emerged victorious. The opera was an unfortunate casualty of that struggle, a sad reminder that sometimes, no matter how grand, the underdog won't always gain the recognition it deserves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The duo were disappointed with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, who felt that he sang poorly. Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991, he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate. However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel.

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family.

She was well aware of the fact that her age and financial situation called for a more conservative approach to investing. After careful consideration and consultation with her financial advisor, she decided to prioritize a strategy that focused on generating stable income and protecting her capital, rather than chasing higher returns with increased levels of risk. The decision to have a higher concentration of bonds in her portfolio was based on various factors. First, bonds are typically seen as a more stable and conservative form of investment when compared to stocks. They provide a fixed income in the form of interest payments, and the repayment of the principal amount is guaranteed as long as the issuer does not default. This predictable stream of income was appealing to the senior woman, as she could use it to cover her living expenses during her retirement years without having to worry about market fluctuations affecting her primary sources of income. Secondly, bonds, particularly those issued by governments and high-quality corporations, have a lower degree of risk compared to stocks. Although they might offer lower potential returns, they also entail less price volatility and a lower likelihood of experiencing significant losses. For the senior woman, preserving her capital was more important than chasing higher returns, as she did not have the luxury of time to recover from potential losses that may come with riskier investments. Additionally, having a higher concentration of bonds in her portfolio would help to protect her from the potential impacts of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates. Fixed-income investments like bonds can act as a hedge against inflation and interest rate changes, as their prices typically have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices may fall, but the income generated from those bonds will generally offset any losses in value. This provides a level of stability and security that is important for an investor in their senior years. Lastly, the senior woman also acknowledged the importance of diversification in her investment strategy. While having a high concentration of bonds in her portfolio provided the stability and security she desired, she was also aware of the need to maintain a small exposure to stocks or other growth-oriented assets to ensure some level of growth potential. This would help her to maintain the purchasing power of her investments and keep up with rising costs during her retirement years. In summary, the senior woman's portfolio was low on stocks but high in bonds as she considered the potential risks and benefits associated with each type of investment. By prioritizing a more conservative investment approach focused on capital preservation and predictable income, she aimed to ensure financial security and stability during her retirement years, while still maintaining some exposure to growth-oriented assets for diversification purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What brighter shade of red did Chapman adopt?  A: One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: In 1933, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman adopted a brighter shade of red for the team's home kit, known as \\"Chapman Red\\" or \\"Arsenal Red.\\" This shade replaced the darker \\"plum red\\" that the team had been wearing since 1913. Chapman believed that the brighter red would make it easier for the players to spot each other on the field and help instill a sense of identity and pride in the team. There are several stories behind Chapman's inspiration for adopting this new shade of red. One such story suggests that he noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt, which caught his attention and sparked the idea to change the team's colors. Another account claims that Chapman was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom he played golf. Regardless of the exact inspiration, the adoption of the brighter red shade was a significant change for the team, and the color has since become synonymous with Arsenal Football Club. Arsenal Red is a distinct and vivid shade often described as having a hint of orange or even a slight resemblance to vermilion or scarlet. The exact hue, however, may vary slightly depending on the specific materials used in the production of jerseys and other merchandise. The change to Arsenal Red was met with great enthusiasm from both players and fans and remains a defining characteristic of the team's identity to this day. In addition to adopting the brighter red, Chapman also introduced white sleeves for the team's home jerseys, which further added to the contrast and visual appeal of the kit. This unique combination of a bright red shirt with white sleeves, now recognized as a trademark of the club, has remained largely unchanged throughout the decades and is considered a classic design in the world of football. In summary, Herbert Chapman adopted a brighter shade of red known as \\"Chapman Red\\" or \\"Arsenal Red\\" to energize the team's image and facilitate better on-field recognition among players. The inspiration for this change is said to have come from observing a fan or possibly a cartoonist wearing a similarly colored outfit, but the exact origin of the idea remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the introduction of the brighter red and the accompanying white sleeves has had a lasting impact on the identity and brand of Arsenal Football Club."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The HOPE IS A GAME--CHANGER PROJECT will deliver unbreakable soccer balls to kids who, all too often, see things horrible, broken and not survive the simplest of circumstances. The project started taking form well before anyone knew where it would lead -which is to test the power of like-minded people working together to turn inspiration into action.  Four years ago Bobby was in Rwanda offering help to the people there and taking photos of a child soldier named Moise with his \\"soccer ball\\",which was a pile of rubbish tied together with a string. This \\"ball\\" was the only thing Moise could call his own --- no family, no home, no place to go. Forced to fight in the Congo and having killed three people at the unbearably young age of seven, the boy's spirit was broken. And Bobby knew, as he took one photo after the next, that he'd never forget him. In fact, he returned the following year to tell Moise he had stayed deep within his heart ---but he was gone.  I recently helped Bobby launch his new bookThe Power of the Invisible Sunwhich features a photo of Moise, his ball, and kids from war-torn areas around the world. All of his earnings go towards the HOPE IS A GAME-CHANGER PROJECT for the kids he visited over the past decade. They caught the emotional landscape from heartbreak to joy, but share the undeniable longing for recovery and hope.  Bobby and I share the unchangeable belief that delivering hope is really a game-changer, especially to a child. We believe that each indestructible ball will come to represent a lasting symbol of hope. A light no matter how small---The Power of the Invisible Sun.

Write a title for this article: AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS, probably the greatest user of an in— house ad agency among the top advertisers, is stripping that agency of all of the advertising functions except media buying. That means that five American Home ad agencies will enjoy a multimillion-dollar windfall. The biggest bonanza goes to the William Esty Company - getting Anacin in four forms, which received 32.3 million in advertising in 1980. That figure and all the other billing figures used here are those published in Leading National Advertisers for that year. Preparation H, a line of hemorrhoid-treatment products that billed 1 0.7 million, goes to Kornhauser & Calene, and Maximum Strength An acin, billing 7.7 million, goes to Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson. All the pharmaceutical brands are from Whitehall Laboratories, as are Trendar and Oxipur, two small brands, that will go to Korhauser & Calene and to Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson, repectively. Then from the Boyle-Midway division, Aerowax, with very little in billings, and Easy-Off oven cleaner, with about 6 million, is being assigned to Cunningham & Walsh, and Sani Flush in the Tank, billing about 2.2 million, will go to Hicks & Greist. The commissions to the agencies, which will be creating the advertising and planning the media, will not, of course, be the full 15 percent, but will probably be in the neighborhood of 11 percent. The house agency is the John F. Murray Agency, which had been part of the American Home Products operation for years, but usually for small brands. Then, in the autumn of 1967, the agency business was shocked to hear that American Home Products was moving its flagship brand, Anacin, out of Ted Bates & Company, which had made it famous with its hammers-in-the-head and fast-fast-fast-relief advertising, and moved it into Murray. That move could very well have been responsible for numerous changes in thinking on the part of advertisers, especially smaller advertisers. Soon after the change, the debates on the merits and failings of house agencies began to boil over, especially at the annual meetings of the Association of National Advertisers. There were all sorts of experiments that were being reported on annually. Ironically, the argument for use of in-house shops usually came down to cost. And now, here in a down economy, American Home Products announces this step. It follows by just a few days an announcement by Lever Brothers, which told its agencies that its in-house media unit would no longer plan media programs, but would execute the plans, the responsibility for which would be returned to Lever's agencies. Apparently the A.H.P. decision evolved from the classic argument against house agencies - you can't get good creativity.

Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia.  During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers.  While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he dress feminine as a child?","output":"Yes, Little Richard did dress feminine as a child.

John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However, bridge building experts throughout the world thought this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea, but Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. \\"We told them so.\\" \\"Crazy men and their crazy dreams.'' \\"It's foolish to chase wild visions.\\" Evcryone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap, Washington was never discouraged. One day he was lying on his bed in hospital, seeing the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment with the sunlight streaming through the windows, and a gentle breeze bowing the  flimsy white curtains apart when an idea hit him. He decided to make the best use of the only finger  he could move. Thus, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm until the bridge was finally completed. Question: What can we learn about Washington's wife? Options: A: She could understand Washington and helped him a lot. B: She cnuldn't understand him but took good care of him.

Q: if you were turned into a bee, name something you'd have to learn how to do. A:","output":"If you were turned into a bee, there are several essential tasks and behaviors you would need to learn how to perform in order to thrive in your new life. Some of these crucial activities include: 1. Flying: As a bee, the ability to fly is critical for various purposes, such as foraging for nectar and pollen, navigating the environment, and escaping predators. You'd need to learn how to control your newly acquired wings and achieve a stable flight pattern. 2. Communication: Bees use a complex dance called the waggle dance to communicate information about food sources and coordinate their foraging efforts. Being able to understand and perform this dance would be vital for sharing information with other bees in your colony. 3. Foraging and collecting resources: Bees gather nectar and pollen from flowers, which serve as their primary food sources. You would need to learn how to locate flowers containing these resources, extract nectar using your proboscis (a bee's tongue-like structure), and collect pollen using your specialized hairs and leg structures called pollen baskets. 4. Defending the hive: Worker bees protect their hive from intruders and potential predators. As a bee, you might have to learn to use your stinger to fend off threats, although it's important to note that honeybees die after stinging as their stinger gets dislodged from their body. 5. Building and maintaining the hive: Bees construct their hives using beeswax, a substance secreted by their wax glands. You would need to learn how to produce and manipulate beeswax to build honeycomb structures for storing food and raising the colony's brood. 6. Caring for the brood: As a worker bee, you may be assigned to nurse and care for the developing eggs, larvae, and pupae in the hive. This involves feeding, grooming, and maintaining optimal temperatures within the brood chamber. 7. Understanding the colony's hierarchy: Bees live in highly social and structured colonies, consisting of the queen bee, male drones, and female worker bees. Each member plays a specific role in the colony's functioning, so it would be essential to recognize your role and how to effectively collaborate with the other bees. By acquiring these essential skills, you would be able to adapt and successfully integrate into your new life as a bee."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984.

Danny Welbeck has a point to prove after leaving Manchester United. The 23-year-old joined Arsenal in a £16million deadline day deal.

The summer transfer window is now closed! It means that soccer teams are done buying and selling players for now. Let's talk about some of these cool changes that happened in the world of soccer. First up, Chelsea did a great job of adding new players to their team and also letting go of some players they didn't need anymore. One important player, Diego Costa, is really helping out his team. He's playing so well that the team is now at the very top of the league table! Next, we have Danny Welbeck. He's a young soccer player who is only 23 years old. Danny used to play for Manchester United, but now he has joined Arsenal, a different team, in a big £16million deal. He really wants to show everyone that he's a great player and has a lot to prove! Now let's talk about Hull. They made some really cool choices by bringing in new players to the team. One of them is Hatem Ben Arfa, who is just borrowing the team. This is called a loan. Isn't that neat? Guess what? Another team, QPR, got a new player named Sandro! He will be really strong and powerful when he helps his team in the middle of the soccer field. That area is called central midfield. Lastly, there were two amazing players named Xabi Alonso and Toni Kroos. A lot of people wish they had moved to the Premier League, but they chose to play in other places. Sometimes, that's just how things work. So there you have it, kids! Those were the exciting changes that happened in the world of soccer during the summer transfer window. Some teams got stronger and better, and we can't wait to see how they play!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A North Carolina resident was found guilty Thursday on terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people overseas.  Anes Subasic, a 35-year old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Bosnia, also was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. He will face up to life in prison at sentencing in August.  Subasic is the seventh member of a North Carolina group of men convicted of terror activities. They were led by Daniel Boyd, who pleaded guilty in February 2011 to conspiring to kill people abroad and to provide material support to terrorists. Boyd's sentencing was delayed so that he could testify against three other co-conspirators who were found guilty last fall.  Two of Boyd's sons also pleaded guilty and are in prison.  According to the government, from November 2006 until at least July 2009, Subasic and the others worked to provide money, weapons training, transportation and personnel to \\"advance violent jihad.\\"  \\"Subasic was part of a group of terrorists; some viewed their own country as the enemy,\\" said M.

Review: Anna (Ursula Andress) is brought in as an official R.N. by ex-lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, Count Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), back to health after a heart attack. But Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count. He has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more \\"vulnerable\\" as he is cured. The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count. The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable.  But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and oh how good. There are many nude scenes, including ones of Anna and Jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental ex-Bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. As she did in Thunderball (remember Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays a femme fatale, sort of, although less elegantly. Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone, the \\"other patient\\" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot. But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. However, Benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and Jole. This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. The Count is free, as the client, to put his hands wherever he wants to on Ursula, and he takes advantage. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions. Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase. \\"The Sensuous Nurse\\" is compact, 77 minutes, but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption, start to finish. Definitely recommended.  Now, what is this review like? Choose your answer from: a). negative b). positive","output":"This review can be described as b). positive.

The label was later launched worldwide.  - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April.  - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Daniel John Braid (born 23 February 1981) is a rugby union player from New Zealand who captains Sale Sharks in the English Premiership. He normally plays at open-side flanker. Previously, he played for the Blues in Super Rugby.

England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Super Rugby (rendered in the current competition logo as \\"SupeRugby\\") is the preeminent professional men's rugby union football competition in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan. Building off various Southern Hemisphere competitions dating back to the South Pacific Championship in 1986, with teams from a number of southern nations, Super Rugby officially started with the 1996 season with 12 teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The competition was known as Super 12 through to the end of the 2005 season; the name was changed to Super 14 with the addition of two teams for the 2006 season; with expansion to 15 teams in the three countries for the 2011 season, the competition was rebranded as Super Rugby (no number included).

How is \\"Once again, I ask that the House kindly approves in its majority this amendment to the rules.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the given phrase \\"Once again, I ask that the House kindly approves in its majority this amendment to the rules\\" could be translated as: \\"Pyydän jälleen kerran, että Eduskunta ystävällisesti hyväksyy enemmistöllään tämän sääntöjen muutoksen.\\" Here is a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"Once again\\" - In Finnish, this is translated as \\"jälleen kerran,\\" which literally means \\"again a time\\" or \\"one more time.\\" 2. \\"I ask\\" - The pronoun \\"I\\" can be translated into Finnish as \\"minä,\\" but most often Finns drop the pronoun in informal speech. In the phrase, \\"ask\\" is translated into \\"pyydän,\\" which is the first-person singular form of the verb \\"pyytää\\" (to ask). 3. \\"That\\" - In this context, the conjunction \\"that\\" is not directly translated into Finnish, instead, the sentence structure is adjusted accordingly. 4. \\"The House\\" - This refers to the Parliament or the \\"Eduskunta\\" in Finnish. 5. \\"Kindly\\" - This word translates to \\"ystävällisesti,\\" which is an adverb derived from the adjective \\"ystävällinen\\" meaning \\"friendly.\\" 6. \\"Approves\\" - The verb \\"to approve\\" translates into \\"hyväksyä\\" in Finnish. In this context, it becomes \\"hyväksyy,\\" which is the third person singular present form. 7. \\"In its majority\\" - The phrase translates into \\"enemmistöllään,\\" which is a combination of \\"enemmistö\\" (majority) and the possessive suffix \\"-lla\\" (it's or its). 8. \\"This\\" - This demonstrative, referring to the amendment, is translated as \\"tämän\\" ('this' in the genitive form, agreeing with \\"muutoksen\\"). 9. \\"Amendment to the rules\\" - The noun \\"amendment\\" is translated into Finnish as \\"muutos\\" or \\"muokkaus.\\" In this context, \\"muutos\\" is preferred as it implies a change in the rules. \\"Rules\\" in Finnish is \\"säännöt.\\" Therefore, the complete phrase is \\"tämän sääntöjen muutoksen\\" with \\"sääntöjen\\" being the plural genitive form (rules'). To summarize, the given phrase in Finnish would be: \\"Pyydän jälleen kerran, että Eduskunta ystävällisesti hyväksyy enemmistöllään tämän sääntöjen muutoksen.\\" While this translation may not be a word-for-word representation due to differences in Finnish and English grammar, it accurately conveys the full meaning of the original phrase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I saw the student.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"I saw the student.\\" is linguistically acceptable in the English language. It is a concisely formed grammatically correct sentence. Let's break down the grammatical components: 1. Subject: \\"I\\" is the subject of the sentence. In English grammar, the subject refers to the person or thing that is doing an action or being described. In this case, \\"I\\" is the one doing the action. 2. Verb: \\"saw\\" is the verb, which is an action word. In this sentence, the action being depicted is seeing. \\"Saw\\" is the past simple tense of the verb \\"see,\\" indicating that the action took place in the past. 3. Object: \\"the student\\" is the object of the sentence. This is the person who is receiving the action or being acted upon. In this sentence, the student is the one being seen. 4. Article: \\"The\\" is used as a definite article in this sentence. An article is a type of adjective that's used to indicate whether the noun is specific or non-specific. \\"The\\" points forward to a specific item or items. Altogether, the sentence is a simple past tense sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, and a direct object. It correctly follows the basic English sentence structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Therefore, the sentence \\"I saw the student.\\" is linguistically acceptable. Furthermore, this sentence correctly conveys a complete thought or message, which is important for linguistic acceptability. A listener or reader can understand from this sentence that at some point in the past, the speaker saw someone who is a student. It leaves no ambiguities or doubts about what is intended to be communicated.  If you want to add more information or details to this sentence, you have the opportunity to add adjectives, adverbs, or prepositional phrases. For example, \\"I quickly saw the diligent student in the library yesterday.\\" Even with these additional details, the sentence would remain linguistically acceptable as long as it follows the rules of grammar and syntax."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Above, we dealt with work problems in which the object is moving in the same direction as the force being applied to it. In reality, this isn't always the case. In cases where the force and the object's motion are in two different directions, the difference between these two directions must also be factored into the equation for an accurate result. To begin, find the magnitude of the force and the object's displacement as you normally would. Let's look at another example problem. In this case, let's say that we're pulling a toy train forward as in the example problem above, but that this time we're actually pulling upward at a diagonal angle. In the next step, we'll take this into account, but for now, we'll stick to the basics: the train's displacement and the magnitude of the force acting on it. For our purposes, let's say that the force has a magnitude of 10 newtons and that it's moved the same 2 meters (6.6 ft) forward as before. Unlike in the examples above, with a force that's in a different direction than the object's motion, it's necessary to find the difference between these two directions in the form of the angle between them. If this information isn't provided to you, you may need to measure it yourself or deduce it from other information in the problem. In our example problem, let's say that the force is being applied about 60o above the horizontal. If the train is still moving directly forward (that is, horizontally), the angle between the force vector and the train's motion is 60o. Once you know the object's displacement, the magnitude of the force acting on it, and the angle between the force vector and its motion, solving is almost as easy as it is without having to take the angle into account. Simply take the cosine of the angle (this may require a scientific calculator) and multiply it by force and displacement to find your answer in joules. Let's solve our example problem. Using a calculator, we find that the cosine of 60o is 1/2. Plugging this into the formula, we can solve as follows: 10 newtons × 2 meters (6.6 ft) × 1/2 = 10 joules. What is a summary?","output":"A summary for this example would be: When an object is moved by a force in a different direction than it's moving, we need to find the angle between the force and the object's motion. In the example, a toy train is being pulled by a 10 Newton force at a 60-degree angle. To calculate the work done, we use the cosine of the angle and multiply it with the force and the object's displacement.

Complete the next sentence: How to post while trotting on a horse  Understand why posting is done.  The main reason to post while riding is to avoid being jostled around in the saddle during a particularly bumpy gait-the trot. This makes things more comfortable for the rider and is easier on the horse's back.","output":"Learn the proper technique for posting. 1. Start by finding a stable and well-fitted saddle, ensuring your safety and comfort while riding. Make sure the stirrups are adjusted to the correct length for your legs, allowing for slight bend in your knees while your feet rest flat in the stirrups. 2. Familiarize yourself with the horse's trotting movement. Observe the rhythm and pattern of the horse's strides, which typically involve two beats, as the diagonal pairs of legs move forward together. 3. Develop a good sitting position. Sitting tall and straight with your heels down, maintain a slight bend in your knees and elbows. Keep your core engaged to maintain balance, while staying relaxed and ready to move with the horse. 4. Begin posting by 'rising' during the upward motion of the horse's trot. As the horse's outside front leg moves forward, lift yourself slightly out of the saddle using your knees and thighs, while keeping your lower legs in contact with the horse's sides. Ensure that your seat moves slightly forward and upward, following the horse's natural movement. 5. Lower yourself back into the saddle after the upward phase, 'sitting' during the downward motion of the trot. This involves returning to your initial seated position, absorbing the impact gently through your knees and hips, and staying in sync with the horse's rhythm. 6. Practice the timing and coordination of the posting trot. Maintain a consistent rhythm as you rise and fall with the horse's movements, to ensure a smooth and comfortable ride for both you and the horse. 7. Refine your technique by keeping your upper body steady and maintaining soft contact with the horse's mouth through the reins. As you gain more confidence and experience, the posting trot will become more natural and intuitive, improving your overall riding skills and enjoyment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Because these worms don't lay eggs, you will need a few live adult microworms to start your culture. Remember that not all nematode species are a good food source, and some may even make your fish sick.  If your local fish store sells live food, check for microworms there. Try getting in touch with other local hobbyists through aquarist clubs. A member there may cultivate microworms and may be willing to either give or sell you a starter. For a few dollars, you can also order microworms online. They are sold everywhere from large general auction sites to small hobbyist forums. If the species is listed, check to make sure that it belongs to the Panagrellus genus. Panagrellus redivivus is the most commonly found microworm. Remember that microworms are tiny white worms that are barely visible to the naked eye. A started culture of a large group of worms should like a gray or light brown clump. If your starter looks significantly different from this, you may have another type of worm that has been misidentified. Almost any container can be used, as long as it's deep enough for you to fit your index finger inside. Clear containers with resealable lids are the most convenient. Some popular options include yoghurt tubs, mason jars, and resealable plastic food containers. Any type of human food-grade starch is usable. Common sources of starch include oatmeal, wheat flour, bread, cornmeal, mashed potatoes, and cereal.  If you're using a sealable container, be sure to poke small slits in the lid with a knife. Air exchange is necessary for a microworm colony to thrive. If your container doesn't have its own lid, cover the top up with tin foil. Microworms don't actually eat the starch. Instead, they eat microscopic yeast that feed on carbohydrates. You can find conveniently packaged dry yeast in the baking section of most supermarkets.  Some stores also sell fresh compressed yeast that must be refrigerated. If you bake bread or brew beer at home, you can also use the same yeast to culture microworms.","output":"To begin cultivating microworms as a food source for your fish, first acquire some live adult microworms, as they do not lay eggs.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater?  The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Curtis Hesler On Commodities Just when we thought there was light at the end of the tunnel, we find it attached to the front of a locomotive. The big surprise next year will be the second and more devastating leg of the recession that started in 2007. Twisted statistics and media hoopla will no longer be able to cover up the fact that real unemployment continues to rise and that small businesses, which account for 70% or more of the jobs in our economy, are failing. Small firms are dehydrating under the onus of higher taxes and government-mandated worker benefits, higher operating costs and constantly eroding consumer demand. The Fed's insistence on promoting a long-term policy of near-zero interest rates has magnetically attracted the carry traders. These folks, often foreign, borrow dollars at artificially low rates and invest the money in higher paying investments. Greed rules, however, and carry traders tend to chase whatever is hot at the moment--currently, gold and the U.S. stock market. The mistake being made by the investment community is believing that the dollar will continue to fall indefinitely without an upside correction, if only to adjust technical imbalances. As the dollar corrects on the up side, the carry trades will unwind their positions. The result will be that investments in gold and the stock market will be sold, dollars bought, and the loans paid off. The consequence, considering that the economy is weaker than twisted statistics reveal and that we are entering period of escalating adjustments in adjusted rate mortgages next year, will be a return to the bear market of 2007-08. The dollar's rally will coincide with a correction in gold back to the 1,000 level where it will offer investors a splendid opportunity to buy either the metal or mining shares. If you are of a mind to pick up a decent gold stock, I suggest the core of your gold portfolio be in Goldcorp ( GG - news - people ). This is likely the very best gold miner on the planet. I have my sights set on accumulating Goldcorp at 34.50 or better during the next correction. Although the dollar rally may last for several months, it will be temporary. Since turning bullish on gold in 1999, I have espoused that the U.S. Dollar Index, now about 76, would fall to at least 60. At this point, that long-term forecast looks woefully short of the mark. Factoring in the events that have developed over the last few years, a better long term target for the U.S. Dollar Index is 40.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Write a summary based on this article: A group of Conservative Party supporters arrive with a portrait outside the home of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her death was announced in London April 8, 2013.      LONDON (Reuters) - Controversial in life, British ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher continued to divide the nation in death, with somber plans for a funeral and eulogies rejected by some in favor of celebrations and parties.      As Britain buzzed with the news on Monday afternoon that the \\"Iron Lady\\" had died, not everyone was in mourning.      In Brixton, south London - the scene of fierce rioting in the 1980s, blamed on deep social divisions as well as racial tensions - a hastily convened party was gathering pace.      \\"Thatcher herself, she represents so much of what people hate about what has happened to Britain in the last 20, 30 years,\\" said 40-year-old graphic designer Ben Windsor, standing next to a man holding a poster with a crude Thatcher cartoon and the words 'rejoice rejoice'.      As policeman watched on, others arrived clutching cans of lager and bottles of wine and shouting 'she's dead!'      By early evening, a quickly rising 199,000 people had \\"liked\\" the isthatcherdeadyet.co.uk website, which had been updated with a large block-capital \\"Yes.\\"      The site encouraged visitors to party and provided a soundtrack.      \\"Margaret Thatcher's dead. This lady's not returning,\\" said the site. The phrase is a play on words of Thatcher's famous remark 'The lady's not for turning', which she said in a speech in 1980 at a political conference to those in her own Conservative party who were urging her to moderate her radical, right-wing polices.      Those policies, credited by some with modernizing Britain, alienated many, who saw her as a destroyer of jobs and traditional industries.      The vitriolic words being hurled 23 years since she stepped down as prime minister showed that many had not forgiven and forgotten.      \\"Best news I have had all year,\\" said one commentator on social website Facebook, who said he was a former miner.      A bottle of milk was placed on the doorstep of Thatcher's home in Belgravia, a reference to her policy of scrapping free milk for primary school children while head of education in the 1970s, a move which earned her the moniker \\"Thatcher the milk snatcher.\\"      A Twitter feed with the hashtag #nowthatchersdead attracted a swift stream of dubious jokes, celebrations and recriminations, as well as some confused fans of the U.S. singer and actress Cher who had misread the tag.      Trade unionists tweeted that they were heading to the pub, while others said they were chilling champagne and asked \\"where the party\\" was.      Fliers have appeared around in London in recent days declaring that there would be a party in Trafalgar Square, a traditional center for celebrations and protests in the capital, on the Saturday following her death.      An attempt to get Ella Fitzgerald's version of 'The Witch is Dead' to chart was the subject of another Facebook campaign on Monday.      Another anti-tribute features in popular musical Billy Elliot, set during the 1980s mining strike. The song contains the words 'Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher, we all celebrate today 'cos it's one day closer to your death'.      The musical is currently running in London.      \\"She wanted to crush the trade unions, the working class movement; she didn't finish us off but that was what her aim was,\\" said Judith Orr, the editor of left-wing newspaper Socialist Worker.      \\"I'm glad to see the back of her.\\"      (Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien, Sarah Young and Paul Sandle; Editing by Peter Graff and Jon Hemming) ||||| Thatcher, Through Bold British Headlines: In Westminster, Londoners remember Margaret Thatcher while picking up their favorite newspapers, each splashed with their own take on the former prime minister.      LONDON — With broadcasters, columnists and editorialists absorbed in chronicling Margaret Thatcher’s life, times and demise, Britons on Tuesday mulled the ideological divide that her critics and even some of her admirers depicted as deepening during her years as prime minister.      While many current and former politicians seemed to form lines to offer their reaction to her death of a stroke at age 87 on Monday, and radio shows were filled with recordings of her best-known utterances, some isolated protests broke out overnight in London, Bristol and Glasgow, reflecting the same social schism between haves and have-nots that characterized the debate over her legacy.      Hundreds of her opponents gathered at the site of violent protests against her policies in the 1980s, with a small crowd in Brixton, in south London — where anti-Thatcher riots broke out in 1981 — chanting “Maggie, Maggie, Maggie — Dead, Dead, Dead.”      The protest recalled the early days of the Thatcher era, when joblessness soared as faltering industries were denied subsidies and a record 10,000 businesses went bankrupt. “Things will get worse before they get better,” she said at the time, depicting the economic malaise as a legacy of left-wing rule. With riots in Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol as well as Brixton, Mrs. Thatcher later recalled 1981 as the worst of her 11 years in office.      At what was billed as a celebratory street party in the southwestern city of Bristol overnight, around 200 people clashed with police officers trying to disperse them early on Tuesday, the police said, and six officers were injured in scuffles. One officer remained in the hospital on Tuesday and one partygoer was arrested on a charge of violent disorder.      “We can’t deny that Lady Thatcher divided opinion,” Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday. But some who castigated her as divisive also paid grudging respect to her stature.      On Tuesday, her admirers depicted her policies, like encouraging private business and crushing labor unions, as liberating the economy from years in the doldrums, while her foes characterized them as ruinous for the poor. Many critics also remembered what was widely seen as a catastrophic political misjudgment toward the end of her third and final term as Britain’s longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century when she sought to impose a so-called community charge, which was widely known as the poll tax, provoking mass public protests.      “Margaret Thatcher broke Britain and replaced what had come before with something crueller, nastier,” the left-wing Daily Mirror said in an editorial. In the northern city of Sheffield, which blamed her for the loss of jobs, a headline in The Star, a regional newspaper, said, “We can never forgive her.”      Several radio shows were devoted to Mrs. Thatcher’s record in crushing organized labor after confrontations with miners and printers, among others. But others recalled more popular measures — like selling public housing to private buyers at reduced prices — that extended private ownership to citizens along with opportunities for small investors to buy stakes in privatized state industries.      The liberal-leaning Guardian said in an editorial: “There should be no dancing on her grave but it is right there is no state funeral either. Her legacy is of public division, private selfishness and a cult of greed, which together shackle far more of the human spirit than they ever set free.”      By contrast, conservative newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail offered enthusiastic praise for what The Mail, in an online commentary echoing Mr. Cameron, called “the woman who saved Britain” and “a giant beside whom other peacetime politicians of the 20th and 21st centuries look like mere pygmies.”      On Monday, Mr. Cameron said Parliament would be recalled from a recess to assemble on Wednesday so that lawmakers can offer their views in advance of a ceremonial funeral with military honors next week, during which Mrs. Thatcher’s body will be brought to St. Paul’s Cathedral on a gun carriage — the traditional cortege for royalty and leaders of stature, including Winston Churchill.      Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday that Queen Elizabeth II would join hundreds of dignitaries at the service on April 17 — the first time she has attended the funeral of a former prime minister since Churchill’s death in 1965.      As is the practice between the monarch and serving prime ministers, the queen and Mrs. Thatcher met for private conversations at weekly audiences. But a biography of Queen Elizabeth by Ben Pimlott said their relationship displayed “a rigidity that never softened.”      Her body will not lie in state and the ceremony will not be a state funeral, according to the British authorities. But it will be conducted with the trappings of a historic moment with streets cordoned off and military honor guards. The funeral will be conducted with the same level of pomp and formality as those of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, and the Queen Mother in 2002, British authorities have said. ||||| Summary:","output":"A long time ago, Margaret Thatcher, who was the leader of Britain, passed away.

Q: We present Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm which extends beam search to allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The algorithm can be used with any model that generates a sequence ŷ = {y0 . . . yT }, by maximizing p(y|x) = ∏ t p(yt|x; {y0 . . . yt−1}). Lexical constraints take the form of phrases or words that must be present in the output sequence. This is a very general way to incorporate additional knowledge into a model’s output without requiring any modification of the model parameters or training data. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of Lexically Constrained Decoding by conducting experiments on Neural Interactive-Predictive Translation, as well as Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation. Experiments show that GBS can provide large improvements in translation quality in interactive scenarios, and that, even without any user input, GBS can be used to achieve significant gains in performance in domain adaptation scenarios.

In order for rocks to be classified as igneous, the rocks must Available choices: (A). solidify at the surface of Earth. (B). be eroded and deposited in layers. (C). be formed from magma. (D). change form when pressure is applied.","output":"The task here is to choose the correct option that describes how rocks should be classified as igneous.  Step 1: Understand the nature of igneous rocks: Igneous rocks are rocks formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This can happen both at the Earth's surface and beneath it, which leads us to the term intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks but overall, they are formed from magma. Step 2: Evaluate each option:  (A) solidify at the surface of Earth: This option partially describes a subset of igneous rocks (extrusive igneous rocks), but not all of them, so it is not fully correct. (B) be eroded and deposited in layers: This is related more to the formation of sedimentary rocks, not igneous rocks. Hence this option is incorrect.  (C) be formed from magma: This is the primary manner in which igneous rocks are formed, thus this option is correct. (D) change form when pressure is applied: This implies the formation of metamorphic rocks, not igneous rocks. Hence this option is incorrect.  Step 3: Pick the correct choice based on the evaluation.  Therefore, the correct choice is (C) be formed from magma. Because the foundational criterion that classifies a rock as igneous is its formation from magma or lava. This principle applies to all igneous rocks irrespective of where they solidify (surface or beneath the Earth)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.

You'd better ask someone else.\\" He looked rather disappointed, hesitated, and then turned away.

I'm not used to a public call box, so, at my first attempt to get through, the warning pips( ) had stopped before I realized I had to insert a coin. When I was at last able to speak, I was told that the person whom I urgently wanted to give a message to had just gone out. Swearing slightly under my breath, I got out of the box and came face to face with the little man. As he raised his hat again, I could see he was quite bald, and a thin line, resembling a dueling( ) scar, crossed one cheek. \\"Excuse my troubling you again.\\" he said nervously.\\"May I walk along with you a little way?

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk.

The assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction: the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule, the Stefan–Boltzmann law (1879–84). But it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature, so that \\"white hot\\" is hotter than \\"red hot\\". Nevertheless, Wilhelm Wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures, by using the principle of adiabatic invariance. At each different temperature, the curve is moved over by Wien's displacement law (1893). Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object, which was correct at high frequencies (short wavelength) but not at low frequencies (long wavelength).

Article: Nobody Benefits NEW YORK--America has been experiencing the longest economic increase in its history.Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings. But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless -- one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminium cans and sells them for five cents a piece.At night, he sleeps on the street. \\"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he's had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine.But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement.He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York city rose more than 27 percent between 1984 and 1999, from US 549 to US 700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies have been built for the poor.Many small apartments in the city now rent for US 1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house. Smiling, he said he also has seven grandchildren whom he'd like to see more often. \\"All I've got to do is clean up my act,\\" he said.

This passage focuses on the societal issue of homelessness and its relation to the growing economy and increasing cost of housing, making it more appropriate to be found on the Society page."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's important to clarify the distinction between galaxies and solar systems. A solar system consists of a star (or a system of stars) and various celestial objects, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, that are gravitationally bound to it. Our solar system, for example, includes the Sun and all the celestial bodies orbiting it, like the Earth, Venus, Mars, and other planets. A galaxy, on the other hand, is a vast system composed of millions or billions of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. It is held together by gravitational forces and can span hundreds of thousands of light-years in diameter. There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. Now, regarding the sentence in question, The Milky Way is, in fact, the name of a galaxy. However, it is not a galaxy \\"in\\" our solar system. Our solar system is just a part of the Milky Way galaxy, so it would be more accurate to say our solar system is within the Milky Way galaxy. The text provided, which mentions the Milky Way, high-velocity clouds, and gas accretion, discusses phenomena happening within the larger context of the Milky Way galaxy. This information supports the fact that the Milky Way is a galaxy, but it doesn't directly address the relationship between the solar system and the Milky Way.

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the basin next to the warehouse located at the point which the Ashton Canal, Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet? from the following article ?  After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the Portland Basin warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the people who died at the palace?, using the article: Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace..., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times On the morning of Nov. 20 last year, Tyrone Tomlin sat in the cage of one of the Brooklyn criminal courthouse’s interview rooms, a bare white cinder-block cell about the size of an office cubicle. Hardly visible through the heavy steel screen in front of him was Alison Stocking, the public defender who had just been assigned to his case. Tomlin, exhausted and frustrated, was trying to explain how he came to be arrested the afternoon before. It wasn’t entirely clear to Tomlin himself. Still in his work clothes, his boots encrusted with concrete dust, he recounted what had happened. The previous afternoon, he was heading home from a construction job. Tomlin had served two short stints in prison on felony convictions for auto theft and selling drugs in the late ’80s and mid-’90s, but even now, grizzled with white stubble and looking older than his 53 years, he found it hard to land steady work and relied on temporary construction gigs to get by. Around the corner from his home in Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tomlin has lived his entire life, he ran into some friends near the corner of Schenectady and Lincoln Avenues outside the FM Brothers Discount store, its stock of buckets, mops, backpacks and toilet paper overflowing onto the sidewalk. As he and his friends caught up, two plainclothes officers from the New York Police Department’s Brooklyn North narcotics squad, recognizable by the badges on their belts and their bulletproof vests, paused outside the store. At the time, Tomlin thought nothing of it. ‘‘I’m not doing anything wrong,’’ he remembers thinking. ‘‘We’re just talking.’’ Tomlin broke off to go inside the store and buy a soda. The clerk wrapped it in a paper bag and handed him a straw. Back outside, as the conversation wound down, one of the officers called the men over. He asked one of Tomlin’s friends if he was carrying anything he shouldn’t; he frisked him. Then he turned to Tomlin, who was holding his bagged soda and straw. ‘‘He thought it was a beer,’’ Tomlin guesses. ‘‘He opens the bag up, it was a soda. He says, ‘What you got in the other hand?’ I says, ‘I got a straw that I’m about to use for the soda.’ ’’ The officer asked Tomlin if he had anything on him that he shouldn’t. ‘‘I says, ‘No, you can check me, I don’t have nothing on me.’ He checks me. He’s going all through my socks and everything.’’ The next thing Tomlin knew, he says, he was getting handcuffed. ‘‘I said, ‘Officer, what am I getting locked up for?’ He says, ‘Drug paraphernalia.’ I says, ‘Drug paraphernalia?’ He opens up his hand and shows me the straw.’’ Stocking, an attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, a public-defense office that represents 45,000 indigent clients a year, had picked up Tomlin’s case file a few minutes before interviewing him. The folder was fat, always a bad sign to a public defender. The documentation submitted by the arresting officer explained that his training and experience told him that plastic straws are ‘‘a commonly used method of packaging heroin residue.’’ The rest of the file contained Tomlin’s criminal history, which included 41 convictions, all of them, save the two decades-old felonies, for low-level nonviolent misdemeanors — crimes of poverty like shoplifting food from the corner store. With a record like that, Stocking told her client, the district attorney’s office would most likely ask the judge to set bail, and there was a good chance that the judge would do it. If Tomlin couldn’t come up with the money, he’d go to jail until his case was resolved. Their conversation didn’t last long. On average, a couple of hundred cases pass through Brooklyn’s arraignment courtrooms every day, and the public defenders who handle the overwhelming majority of those cases rarely get to spend more than 10 minutes with each client before the defendant is called into court for arraignment. Before leaving, Stocking relayed what the assistant district attorney told her a few minutes earlier: The prosecution was prepared to offer Tomlin a deal. Plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, serve 30 days on Rikers and be done with it. Tomlin said he wasn’t interested. A guilty plea would only add to his record and compound the penalties if he were arrested again. ‘‘They’re mistaken,’’ he told Stocking. ‘‘It’s a regular straw!’’ When the straw was tested by the police evidence lab, he assured her, it would show that he was telling the truth. In the meantime, there was no way he was pleading guilty to anything. When it was Tomlin’s turn in front of the judge, events unfolded as predicted: The assistant district attorney handling the case offered him 30 days for a guilty plea. After he refused, the A.D.A. asked for bail. The judge agreed, setting it at 1,500. Tomlin, living paycheck to paycheck, had nothing like that kind of money. ‘‘If it had been 100, I might have been able to get that,’’ he said afterward. As it was, less than 24 hours after getting off work, Tomlin was on a bus to Rikers Island, New York’s notorious jail complex, where his situation was about to get a lot worse. ‘‘Criminal justice,’’ President Obama said in a speech to the N.A.A.C.P. last month, ‘‘is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it.’’ Two days after the speech, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, meeting with convicts in a corrections institution in El Reno, Okla. The setting was dramatic, but mass incarceration isn’t actually a federal problem. Of the 2.2 million people currently locked up in this country, fewer than one in 10 is being held in a federal prison. Far more are serving time in state prisons, and nearly three-quarters of a million aren’t in prison at all but in local city and county jails. Of those in jails, 60 percent haven’t been convicted of anything. They’re innocent in the eyes of the law, awaiting resolution in their cases. Some of these inmates are being held because they’re considered dangerous or unlikely to return to court for their hearings. But many of them simply cannot afford to pay the bail that has been set. Occasionally, these cases make the news. In June, Sandra Bland was found dead in her cell in Texas after failing to come up with 500 for her release. But often, they go unnoticed. The federal government doesn’t track the number of people locked up because they can’t make bail. What we do know is that at any given time, close to 450,000 people are in pretrial detention in the United States — a figure that includes both those denied bail and those unable to pay the bail that has been set. Even that figure fails to capture the churn of local incarceration: In a given year, city and county jails across the country admit between 11 million and 13 million people. In New York City, where courts use bail far less than in many jurisdictions, roughly 45,000 people are jailed each year simply because they can’t pay their court-assigned bail. And while the city’s courts set bail much lower than the national average, only one in 10 defendants is able to pay it at arraignment. To put a finer point on it: Even when bail is set comparatively low — at 500 or less, as it is in one-third of nonfelony cases — only 15 percent of defendants are able to come up with the money to avoid jail. Bail hasn’t always been a mechanism for locking people up. When the concept first took shape in England during the Middle Ages, it was emancipatory. Rather than detaining people indefinitely without trial, magistrates were required to let defendants go free before seeing a judge, guaranteeing their return to court with a bond. If the defendant failed to return, he would forfeit the amount of the bond. The bond might be secured — that is, with some or all of the amount of the bond paid in advance and returned at the end of the trial — or it might not. In 1689, the English Bill of Rights outlawed the widespread practice of keeping defendants in jail by setting deliberately unaffordable bail, declaring that ‘‘excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed.’’ The same language was adopted word for word a century later in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. But as bail has evolved in America, it has become less and less a tool for keeping people out of jail, and more and more a trap door for those who cannot afford to pay it. Unsecured bond has become vanishingly rare, and in most jurisdictions, there are only two ways to make bail: post the entire amount yourself up front — what’s called ‘‘money bail’’ or ‘‘cash bail’’ — or pay a commercial bail bondsman to do so. For relatively low bail amounts — say, below 2,000, the range in which most New York City bails fall — the second option often doesn’t even exist; bondsmen can’t make enough money from such small bails to make it worth their while. With national attention suddenly focused on the criminal-justice system, bail has been cited as an easy target for reformers. But ensuring that no one is held in jail based on poverty would, in many respects, necessitate a complete reordering of criminal justice. The open secret is that in most jurisdictions, bail is the grease that keeps the gears of the overburdened system turning. Faced with the prospect of going to jail for want of bail, many defendants accept plea deals instead, sometimes at their arraignments. New York City courts processed 365,000 arraignments in 2013; well under 5 percent of those cases went all the way to a trial resolution. If even a small fraction of those defendants asserted their right to a trial, criminal courts would be overwhelmed. By encouraging poor defendants to plead guilty, bail keeps the system afloat. ‘‘What, did they arrest all of Brooklyn today?’’ one court officer asked another on a recent Sunday night in one of the two bustling arraignment courtrooms in Downtown Brooklyn. Defendants, a vast majority of them black, paraded past the judge in quick succession: Unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Open container of alcohol in public. Marijuana possession. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. Misdemeanors, many of them minor, some aggravated by an outstanding bench warrant for failure to appear in court on another case, failure to complete court-ordered community service or failure to pay a fine. Hundreds of people were awaiting arraignment, first in central booking across the street, then in cells on the ninth floor and finally in a small communal cell called ‘‘the pen’’ behind the arraignment courtrooms on the ground floor. On this night, there were more than a dozen men in the cell waiting to see a lawyer, pacing, sitting on benches, crouching in corners. One man called out from the pen, saying that there was dried excrement in there from the day before. ‘‘Nobody comes in here to clean!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘It’s mad dirty!’’ A guard approached the bars and briefly sprayed a can of air freshener. Around the corner, the pen opened onto a series of booths, where, separated by heavy metal screens, the defendants met with their lawyers. Scott Hechinger, a senior trial attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, picked up a stack of case files, quickly scanned the charges and rap sheets, stepped down a short hallway behind the courtroom and started calling names through the mesh screen. The first client was charged with criminal mischief after getting in an argument with his girlfriend and breaking some bowls. It was more complicated than that, he told Hechinger. She came home drunk, threw his clothes out the window. It escalated. He left. They arrested him across the street. Hechinger called the girlfriend and left a message. He called the client’s mother, whom the man lived with. If bail was set, how much could she afford? At most 250. Time’s up. Next case. A young man jumped a subway turnstile. Prosecutors were offering to make it go away and let him out that night if he did two days of community service and avoided being rearrested for the next six months. This one was easy. ‘‘Take the deal,’’ Hechinger said. It was better than paying a 120 fee. Next up was a homeless teenager, charged with ‘‘obstruction of governmental administration.’’ The paperwork said the police saw him with a knife, and that he resisted arrest. He said there was no knife, that the cops stopped him for no reason and beat him. He showed Hechinger bruises on his arms and a fat lip. It was hard to see much through the screen. Hechinger promised to take a closer look in a few minutes when they were in front of the judge together. The final person was a man arrested for driving with a suspended license, a straightforward case. After less than half an hour, Hechinger was back in the courtroom. The defendants he interviewed were marched out onto a bench against the left wall. First was the turnstile jumper. The prosecutor laid out the charges and the offer. The defendant took the deal and would have to complete community service. Next was the homeless teenager. The prosecutor asked for bail of 5,000. Hechinger argued that bail was unnecessary. The judge set it at 250. The teenager didn’t have it. He would be sleeping at Rikers. The guy with the suspended license was released on his own recognizance — without any bail — and would be due back in court in a couple of months. Next appeared the man who broke his girlfriend’s bowls. The prosecutor wanted bail set at 2,500. Hechinger argued that there was no reason to believe his client wouldn’t return to court on his own. The judge set it at 1,000. ‘‘Your honor, I called the mother, she said she could afford 250,’’ Hechinger said. ‘‘I’m sorry, counselor, that’s my bail decision,’’ the judge responded. Another half-hour had elapsed. Hechinger went back to the case pile and picked up another stack. One of the three other defenders working the courtroom stepped up with her own cases. When court shut down for the night at 1 a.m., defendants were still waiting. They would stay in their cells and be arraigned when court started up again in the morning. The sheer speed of the arraignment process makes it virtually impossible for the court to make informed decisions. Prosecutors have nothing to go on but a statement from the police and possibly a complaining witness, and defense lawyers know only what they’ve been able to glean from their brief interviews and perhaps a phone call or two. It’s in this hurried moment, at the very outset of a criminal case, before evidence has been weighed or even gathered, that a defendant’s freedom is decided. The stakes are high, and not only for the obvious reason that jail is an unpleasant and often dangerous place to be. A pretrial stretch in jail can unravel the lives of vulnerable defendants in significant ways. The next hearing in Tyrone Tomlin’s drinking-straw case was scheduled for a week after his arraignment. He left the courthouse, was loaded onto a bus and crossed the narrow causeway that connects Queens to Rikers. Tomlin was assigned to the Anna M. Kross Center, one of 10 correctional facilities on the island. Incarcerated people rarely have nice things to say about the places where they’re locked up, but an investigation by the United States attorney’s office this year found ‘‘a deep-seated culture of violence’’ among Rikers guards, who reported using force against inmates more than 4,000 times last year. Violence among inmates is also pervasive. A Department of Corrections document obtained by The Daily News reported 108 stabbings and slashings in the last year. ‘‘That place is miserable,’’ Tomlin said. ‘‘It’s dangerous. It’s every man for himself. You could get abused, you could get raped, you could get extorted. That stuff is all around.’’ Housed in a unit with more than 50 other prisoners, Tomlin tried to keep his head down, and he was able to get through a week without incident. Outside, his aunt worried about him. His employer had no idea where he was. On Nov. 25, he was back in court for a discovery hearing, during which prosecutors were supposed to turn over any relevant evidence. None was presented, but prosecutors repeated their offer for Tomlin to plead guilty. He still refused. ‘‘I wasn’t taking nothing, because I didn’t do nothing,’’ he says. His case was adjourned for another two weeks. Tomlin’s willingness to hold out against the charges was unusual. Across the criminal-justice system, bail acts as a tool of compulsion, forcing people who would not otherwise plead guilty to do so. A 2012 report by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, based on 10 years’ worth of criminal statistics, bears this out. In nonfelony cases in which defendants were not detained before their trials, either because no bail was set or because they were able to pay it, only half were eventually convicted. When defendants were locked up until their cases were resolved, the conviction rate jumped to 92 percent. This isn’t just anecdotal; a multivariate analysis found that even controlling for other factors, pretrial detention was the single greatest predictor of conviction. ‘‘The data suggest that detention itself creates enough pressure to increase guilty pleas,’’ the report concluded. Still awaiting a trial, Tomlin returned to Rikers and quickly got into trouble with a group of younger inmates while on the phone with his aunt. ‘‘A young guy tells me, ‘Yo, pop, you gotta get off the phone,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘I said, ‘I’m in the middle of an important call.’ He wanted me to just hang up.’’ Tomlin quickly realized he’d made a mistake. That evening, in the shower, he was jumped by a group of young men. ‘‘Most of the punches went to the side of my head and my eye,’’ he said. ‘‘I was tussling one and had to worry about the other three, there was blows coming from everywhere.’’ Punched, kicked and stomped, Tomlin received medical attention, his face monstrously misshapen, his left eye swollen shut. ‘‘You’d think I was Frankenstein’s brother or something,’’ he said. Tomlin’s eye was still swollen shut on Dec. 10, three weeks after his arrest, when he returned to court. At this hearing, prosecutors handed over a report from the police laboratory, which had tested the drinking straw. At the top of the report, in bold, underlined capital letters, were the words ‘‘No Controlled Substance Identified, Notify District Attorney.’’ The report had been faxed to the district attorney on Nov. 25, the same day as Tomlin’s last court hearing and days before his beating. The key to his freedom had been sitting unexamined. Conceding that the case had unraveled, the prosecutor asked that the charges be dismissed. ‘‘The judge says, ‘Mr. Tomlin, this is your lucky day, you’re going home,’ ’’ Tomlin recalls. ‘‘I just left the courtroom, signed some papers and that was it.’’ Tomlin had lost three weeks of income, was subjected to brutal physical violence and missed Thanksgiving dinner with his family. But he resisted the pressure to plead guilty. His previous convictions all came from pleas, most of them made with bail looming over him. He knows the bitter Catch-22 of pleading guilty to get out of jail. ‘‘It feels great to go home,’’ he says. ‘‘Anybody’s happy to go home. But at the same time, it feels bad, because that’s more damage on your record.’’ For defendants who would fight their cases and maintain their innocence if they had the money, a guilty plea involves a ritual of court procedure that verges on the Kafkaesque: ‘‘Your lawyer tells me you want to plead guilty to the charge. Is that correct?’’ the judge will ask. Yes, the defendant must reply. ‘‘You understand that by your plea of guilty you are giving up certain trial rights?’’ Yes. ‘‘The right to remain silent, the right to confront witnesses against you, the right to have the prosecutor prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?’’ Yes, yes, yes. And then: ‘‘Are you pleading guilty freely and voluntarily, because you are in fact guilty?’’ Hechinger, the lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services, hates this part of the process. ‘‘A lot of times, at that last question, you feel the client beside you bristle,’’ he says. ‘‘Everyone in the room knows it’s not ‘freely and voluntarily.’ They’re making a decision coerced by money. In many cases, if they had money, they wouldn’t be pleading. But they put their heads down, and they say, ‘Yes.’ It’s a horrible, deflating feeling.’’ The long-term damage that bail inflicts on vulnerable defendants extends well beyond incarceration. Disappearing into the machinery of the justice system separates family members, interrupts work and jeopardizes housing. ‘‘Most of our clients are people who have crawled their way up from poverty or are in the throes of poverty,’’ Hechinger says. ‘‘Our clients work in service-level positions where if you’re gone for a day, you lose your job. People in need of caretaking — the elderly, the young — are left without caretakers. People who live in shelters, where if they miss their curfews, they lose their housing. Folks with immigration concerns are quicker to be put on the immigration radar. So when our clients have bail set, they suffer on the inside, they worry about what’s happening on the outside, and when they get out, they come back to a world that’s more difficult than the already difficult situation that they were in before.’’ This spring, a 24-year-old woman named Adriana found herself newly single in New York, trying to make a life for herself and her daughter. Short and round, with oversize glasses that frequently slide off her nose, she has an easy manner and deadpan sense of humor that belie her past as a runaway from an abusive mother. Adriana arrived in New York in the middle of 2014 with her baby daughter, not yet 2, and knew no one but her boyfriend at the time, a controlling figure who lived off her earnings from massages she advertised on Craigslist. (Like many runaways, Adriana had sometimes relied on sex work to survive, though recently she was trying to avoid it.) After separating from her boyfriend, Adriana managed to secure a spot in a Brooklyn shelter for victims of domestic violence. ‘‘I was trying to get a job, trying to get my life together,’’ she says. She was focused on her daughter. ‘‘I just want to be the best mother for her that I can be,’’ she says. ‘‘That’s my priority. That’s my only priority.’’ (Because of safety concerns, Adriana asked not to be identified by her full name.) On the night of March 18, Adriana realized she was running low on diapers. A friend at the shelter who also had a child agreed to keep an eye on her daughter, and Adriana headed to a nearby Target. This was after curfew, and when a staff member saw Adriana leaving without her daughter, she called the police. ‘‘When I got to Target, I started getting all these texts from my friend,’’ Adriana says. ‘‘She was saying, ‘You’ve got to get back here — there are staff in your room, and they won’t let me in to look after the baby.’ ’’ Adriana rushed home with the diapers. In the shelter’s courtyard, she was met by police officers, who had her daughter. ‘‘Where are you going with my baby?’’ she asked, according to court documents. ‘‘That’s my baby. I just went to the store to buy diapers.’’ It didn’t matter. The police placed her under arrest, charging her with endangering the welfare of a child. She gave one of the officers the diapers she’d just bought, in case her daughter needed to be changed. She was handcuffed and taken to the precinct. The police took her daughter to the station, too, where she was turned over to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services and eventually placed in a foster home. Before her arraignment two days later, Adriana explained to her public defender what happened. Her friend could confirm that she was looking after the baby, she said. The lawyer told Adriana she’d do her best to get her released on her own recognizance. But when Adriana appeared in front of Judge Rosemarie Montalbano, the assistant district attorney asked for bail to be set at 5,000. Adriana had no criminal record and had never failed to make a court appearance, but the prosecutor cited an ‘‘A.C.S. history,’’ meaning that Adriana and her daughter had previous contact with the Administration for Children’s Services. This was true but misleading. The A.C.S. report involving Adriana had found that she wasn’t responsible for any neglect or abuse. What the A.C.S. did find was violence and coercion on the part of her boyfriend; this is how Adriana landed a spot in the domestic-violence shelter. But arraignments happen quickly. Just as there was no time to track down Adriana’s friend to confirm that her daughter hadn’t been left unsupervised, there was no time to find out what the A.C.S. order actually said. The judge set bail at 1,500. Adriana’s public defender couldn’t believe it. ‘‘Judge, I’m going to ask you to state the reason for setting bail in this case,’’ she said, according to the court transcript. ‘‘Thank you, counsel,’’ was the judge’s only reply. With no way to come up with 1,500, Adriana spent the next two weeks on Rikers Island. Her bail made it harder for her to fight her case, but it also effectively dismantled the new life she was trying to build for herself and her daughter. She lost her bed at the shelter, and her child was living with strangers. ‘‘It feels like they were kicking me when I was down,’’ she says. Over subsequent hearings, Adriana’s lawyers tried to get her bail lifted, but they ran into another common problem facing defendants: Once a judge sets bail, other judges are often reluctant to second-guess their colleague’s decision. If they free a defendant who commits a crime while out on bail, the blowback from politicians, police unions and the tabloid press can be substantial. ‘‘I have no idea what motivated Judge Montalbano to set bail,’’ said Judge Andrew Borrok at one of Adriana’s hearings, four days after her arraignment. Still, he said, ‘‘I’m not inclined to change what’s been done.’’ Adriana’s lawyers managed to move her case to a court that specialized in sex-trafficking cases, hoping for a more sympathetic judge and prosecutors. In the trafficking court, however, prosecutors remained reluctant to lift bail, now citing concerns that Adriana’s safety could be at risk if her ex-boyfriend found out she was set free. Ultimately, after two weeks of hearings, prosecutors agreed to remove Adriana’s bail provided she complete weekly ‘‘life-skills coursework’’ administered by a group that serves arrested sex workers. ‘‘Congratulations on being in a place where a lot of people care about you,’’ Adriana remembers the judge telling her as she stood before him in handcuffs, quietly asking a court officer to push her glasses back up her nose. ‘‘There’s a lot of people in this room that want good things to happen to you. The fear is that you’re not ready for all of these great things.’’ The judge ordered Adriana released. She could begin reassembling her life, finding a new shelter, retrieving whatever remained of her possessions. But her baby was still in foster care, and her case still wasn’t resolved. In June, a judge finally agreed to dismiss her case if she wasn’t arrested for the next six months. As this story went to press, five months after her arrest, she was still fighting in family court to regain custody of her daughter. Outside the courtroom after the hearing for her release, Scott Hechinger, who helped coordinate Adriana’s defense, was exasperated. ‘‘Remember,’’ he said, ‘‘this is all about some diapers! Bail changes the conversation. If bail hadn’t been set, Adriana wouldn’t have to be negotiating to get out of Rikers. She’d just be released.’’ In early 2013, Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the State of New York, decided that the business-as-usual approach to setting bail could not be tolerated any longer. ‘‘We still have a long way to go before we can claim that we have established a coherent, rational approach to pretrial justice,’’ he said in his annual State of the Judiciary address. ‘‘Incarcerating indigent defendants for no other reason than that they cannot meet even a minimum bail amount strips our justice system of its credibility and distorts its operation.’’ Lipp­man sent a package of proposed legislation to reduce the reliance on cash bail to lawmakers in Albany, and he lobbied for the reforms hard in the press. His efforts went nowhere. ‘‘Zero,’’ Lippman says, shaking his head. ‘‘Nothing.’’ Lawmakers had no appetite for bail reform. Two years later, that may be changing. This summer, the New York City Council took a tentative step toward reform by earmarking 1.4 million for a citywide fund to bail out low-level offenders. The fund, proposed with much fanfare by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito in her State of the City address in February, is modeled on a number of smaller bail funds around the city. The oldest of these, the Bronx Freedom Fund, was established in 2007 in association with the Bronx Defenders, a public-defender organization. The founders shut down the fund after only a year and a half, after a judge argued that it was effectively operating as an unlicensed bail-bond business. But before they did, the fund bailed out nearly 200 defendants and generated some illuminating statistics. Ninety-six percent of the fund’s clients made it to every one of their court appearances, a return rate higher even than that of people who posted their own bail. More than half of the Freedom Fund’s clients, now able to fight their cases outside jail, saw their charges completely dismissed. Not a single client went to jail on the charges for which bail had been posted. By comparison, defendants held on bail for the duration of their cases were convicted 92 percent of the time. The numbers showed what everyone familiar with the system already knew anecdotally: Bail makes poor people who would otherwise win their cases plead guilty. Armed with these statistics, as well as a 2010 Human Rights Watch report that calculated that New York City was paying 42 million a year to incarcerate nonfelony defendants, the Freedom Fund’s founders managed to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation explicitly legalizing nonprofit bail funds. In 2013, the Freedom Fund resumed operation. Close behind was the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, begun by Scott Hechinger and a colleague at Brooklyn Defender Services. It was opened this spring and has already bailed out more than 60 clients. But even the staunchest supporters of bail funds are quick to say that they are, at best, temporary Band-Aids for a broken system. ‘‘They are a useful form of relief as long as people are being locked up because they’re poor,’’ says Hechinger, who is no longer affiliated with the Brooklyn bail fund. ‘‘They’re an intervention for an urgent need. But they’re not actual bail reform.’’ Earlier this summer, in the wake of the shocking suicide of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager arrested on suspicion of stealing a backpack and held on bail for three years in Rikers before his case was dismissed, Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled his own initiative. ‘‘I wish, I deeply wish, we hadn’t lost him — but he did not die in vain,’’ de Blasio said. The centerpiece of de Blasio’s initiative is a 17.8 million citywide initiative based on pilot programs that have been running in Queens and Manhattan, offering something called ‘‘supervised release.’’ Under these programs, a small number of qualifying defendants, who might otherwise be held on bail, are instead set free and required to check in with caseworkers by phone and in person. The pilot programs have shown good results, but they have narrowly tailored eligibility requirements. Tyrone Tomlin, for example, would not have been eligible because he had too many previous convictions. Kalief Browder would not have been eligible, either, because the crime he was accused of, stealing a backpack, was charged as second-degree robbery, a violent felony. ‘‘If Kalief Browder’s death wasn’t in vain,’’ says Peter Goldberg, executive director of the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, ‘‘it won’t be because of the proposals we’ve seen so far from the city.’’ The only truly meaningful reform, many observers agree, is to take money out of the bail process entirely. Lippman has been championing this idea for several years. ‘‘You have to eliminate cash bail,’’ he says. The ramifications of such a move are far-reaching. Without bail — and the quick guilty pleas that it produces — courts would come under significant strain. ‘‘The system would shut down,’’ Goldberg says. ‘‘A lot of the 250 people who were waiting to be arraigned in Brooklyn last night would all be coming back to court soon to go forward with a trial for a misdemeanor that no one has any interest in pursuing.’’ This crisis, Goldberg believes, would be a good thing. ‘‘You want pressure on the system. You want everyone involved to be reconsidering. Because of how much it could clog the system, you might have people on high telling cops to stop picking people up for an open-container violation, because ‘I don’t want to deal with it in my courtroom.’ ’’ The idea of eliminating cash bail is hardly unprecedented. When Washington overhauled its bail system in the 1980s and ’90s, it instituted a supervised-release program and other measures designed to reduce the number of people held on bail. But judges continued to set bail until the law was rewritten to effectively forbid the imprisonment of people on financial grounds. The number of people locked up on bail plummeted. ‘‘D.C. had all the tools in place,’’ says Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute. ‘‘They just needed a way to change the court culture.’’ Kentucky, Colorado and, last year, New Jersey have joined Washington in adopting legislation severely curtailing bail’s use. The more modest reforms being proposed in New York City, Goldberg says, are hardly cause for celebration. ‘‘Robert Kennedy, when he was attorney general, raised exactly the concerns with bail we’re talking about now,’’ he says. ‘‘Fifty years later, we’re still having the conversation. We can’t be satisfied with cosmetic fixes. And the truth is, even meaningful bail reform is just the beginning. The real work is asking why we’re arresting so many people on low-level offenses in the first place, and why so many of them come from poor black and brown communities. Bail is easy.’’ In late June, Tyrone Tomlin sat at a picnic table in St. John’s Park in Crown Heights, trying to cool down after a hot day of work and sipping bodega iced tea through a straw. Beneath his baseball cap, his left eye still looked askew, his gaze unfocused and hard to meet. ‘‘My sight is still a little blurry,’’ he said. ‘‘I still feel the aftereffects. Pains in my eye, in my head.’’ The whole situation could have been worse, he knows. He could have been hurt more seriously at Rikers. He could have been fired from his construction job, after being a no-show for the better part of a month while locked up. But even so, he was still angry about what happened last winter. ‘‘I’m not no prince,’’ he acknowledged. ‘‘But I got a raw deal.’’ The inability to make bail has been a virtual constant in Tomlin’s life. His first encounter with the law came when he was 14 or 15 — he recalls being picked up on a robbery charge and sent to Spofford juvenile detention center in the Bronx because his family couldn’t pay bail. After a few months, he says, he pleaded guilty and received probation. ‘‘They said it’s supposed to teach you a lesson,’’ he said. ‘‘It just got me worse.’’ In two-thirds of the times he has pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in the last 14 years, he did so either at arraignment to avoid being sent to Rikers or after already spending as much as two weeks at Rikers. Not once has he been able to pay bail. “I’m not Johnny Rich-Kid with a silver spoon,” he says. For Tomlin, the historical evolutions of bail and pretrial jurisprudence are abstractions without meaning in his life. Bail is simply a feature of the landscape, the thing that means he is locked up when someone with more money wouldn’t be. ‘‘Sure, yeah, I’m mad about it,’’ he said grudgingly. ‘‘But that’s the way it is. I’ve got to accept it. It’s not right, but it’s the way it is.’’ He shrugged. ‘‘What are you going to do?’’ Nick Pinto is a freelance journalist living in Brooklyn.

Write a title for this article: SAN FRANCISCO  Apple encroached upon Google’s turf on Tuesday with its acquisition of Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company. The sale, which Quattro announced, is the latest sign that the mobile phone is the next battleground for technology companies, particularly for Apple and Google, which are increasingly in competition. Apple paid close to 300 million for Quattro, according to a person briefed on the deal. While Apple, maker of the iPhone, branched into advertising on Tuesday, Google, which is predominantly an advertising company, began selling its first piece of consumer hardware, the Nexus One cellphone. “You can just see the tempers rising between the two companies,” said Gene Munster, the senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray covering Internet companies. “Two years ago it was a very friendly relationship. Now just every day it gets more competitive.” In November, Google agreed to buy AdMob, a mobile advertising network that competed with Quattro, for 750 million. Apple had also been interested in AdMob, according to people with knowledge of that deal. With Quattro, Apple will also compete in the mobile ad market with Microsoft and Yahoo. Apple is probably less interested in profiting from ads than in making the iPhone the most attractive device for developers to build applications, analysts said. Eighty percent of the three billion downloads from Apple’s App Store are free, Mr. Munster said. By offering a way to sell ads, Apple will help these developers  as well as developers who might build applications for a future Apple tablet  make money. “My hypothesis is this has more to do with ensuring their platform is as valuable to developers as any other platform,” said Julie A. Ask, a vice president and mobile analyst at Forrester, a research firm. Quattro  which is based in Waltham, Mass., and was financed by Highland Capital Partners and Globespan Capital Partners  places ads for major companies including Ford, Procter & Gamble and Visa. It serves four billion ad impressions a month on iPhones, Google Android devices and other smartphones. The ads range from full-blown applications or videos to small brand ads on a group of Web sites including those of Time, CBS Interactive and Gawker Media. The business of placing ads on cellphone screens is nascent but quickly growing. Advertisers spent just 416 million on mobile ads in 2009, compared with 22 billion on Web sites, according to eMarketer. Yet mobile ad spending is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2013, as smartphones and other small mobile computing devices become increasingly popular. Seventeen percent of adult cellphone subscribers in the United States have smartphones, up from 11 percent a year ago, according to Forrester.

Only half of Americans see Christmas as a religious holiday these days, and plan to go to church, however a surprising three quarters say they believe in the virgin birth. New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration steeped in traditions like gift giving and getting together with family rather than a time for religious reflection. While about seven out of 10 Americans said they typically attended religious services to mark the holiday when they were children, only 54 per cent say they plan to attend Christmas services this year. Scroll down for video. Only half of Americans see Christmas as more of a religious holiday these days. 'There are significant generational differences in the way Americans plan to celebrate Christmas this year, with younger adults less likely than older adults to incorporate religious elements into their holiday celebrations,' the report states. People aged 29 with be the least represented age group at mass, with only 46 per cent planning to go along, compared to 60 per cent of over 65s. Women are also more inclined to go to church than men, 58 per cent compared to 50 per cent, and parents with children at home are more likely to attend a service than those whose kids have flown the nest. New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration. Younger adults are less likely than older adults to incorporate religious elements into their holiday celebrations, Pew found. Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood. While lower than in the past, the proportion of people who plan to go to church, 54 per cent, is significantly higher to the 36 per cent of people who attend services every Sunday. About nine out of 10 adults who see Christmas as a religious holiday said they believe Jesus was born of a virgin. Interestingly, however, even among those who celebrate Christmas as a cultural holiday and those who do not celebrate Christmas, roughly half said they believe in the virgin birth. Irrespective of their religious affiliations, Pew found nearly everyone gathers with family and friends on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and did so in childhood. 'This type of gathering is common among all demographic and religious groups in the population,' the research states. They also plan to buy gifts for their loved ones. Around 80 per cent said they have put up a Christmas tree, slightly less than the number who said they had a fir when they were children, and the practice of sending Christmas or holiday cards and caroling has fallen out of fashion throughout the years. Only 31 per cent of people said they would pretend Santa Claus will visit their home, compared to 72 per cent who said this was a tradition when they were younger. The survey, conducted December 3-8, 2013, among 2,001 adults nationwide, found commercialization of Christmas was the most frustrating thing for American families. One-third say they dislike the materialism of the holidays, one-fifth dislike the expenses associated with the season, and one-tenth dislike holiday shopping and the crowded malls and stores.

Hardy Rodenstock (born December 7, 1941 in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), legal name Meinhard Gorke ) is a former publisher and manager of pop and Schlager music in Germany and is a prominent wine collector, connoisseur, and trader, with a special interest in old and rare wines. He became famous for his allegedly uncanny ability to track down old and very rare wines, and for arranging extravagant wine tastings featuring these wines. It has been alleged that Rodenstock is the perpetrator of an elaborate wine fraud. In 1992, a German court found that Rodenstock had \\"knowingly offered adulterated wine\\" for sale. In May 2008, a book about the controversy was published under the title The Billionaire's Vinegar, written by Benjamin Wallace. In the book a tritium test and two carbon-14 tests date the wine circa 1962. Later, a cesium-137 test gave similar results. Rodenstock was not available for comments on the publication of the book. Auctioneer Michael Broadbent, on the other hand, was unhappy with how his relationship to Rodenstock was portrayed in the book.  In July 2009 it was announced that Michael Broadbent would sue Random House, the publishers of The Billionaire's Vinegar, for libel and defamation of character, on claims that the book made allegations that suggested that Broadbent had behaved in an unprofessional manner in the way in which he had auctioned some of these bottles and that his relationship and dealings with Hardy Rodenstock was suspected of being improper. The suit was filed in the United Kingdom, whose libel laws are favorable to the plaintiff. Unlike U.S. law, in English defamation law even true allegations can be defamatory. Random House initially stated it did not believe it had defamed Broadbent and would defend the lawsuit.  In October 2009, Random House, avoiding trial, entered into a settlement agreement with Broadbent. In a statement read out in open court, Random House apologised unreservedly for making the allegations, and accepted that they were untrue. It gave an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and paid Broadbent undisclosed damages. It removed the book from sale in the United Kingdom. It also was reported that Wallace was not a party to the lawsuit or settlement, that Random House would be making no changes to the book, and that it would continue to publish the book in all territories except the UK.  The film rights to The Billionaire's Vinegar have been purchased by a Hollywood consortium, while HBO simultaneously had bought the film rights to the corresponding The New Yorker article.","output":"This text is about Hardy Rodenstock, a former publisher and manager of pop and Schlager music in Germany, who later became a prominent wine collector, connoisseur, and trader with a special interest in old and rare wines.

On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011. Why didn't Neptune appear to be in it's exact discover position?  (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Neptune did not appear in its exact discovery position for a couple of reasons: 1. Earth's position: The Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical path, taking approximately 365.26 days to complete one orbit. Due to this, the Earth's position relative to the Sun changes continually. On 11 July 2011, when Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, the Earth was in a different location in its orbit compared to where it was during Neptune's discovery. This difference in the Earth's position affected the observed location of Neptune in the sky. 2. Heliocentric vs. barycentric coordinate systems: The motion of celestial bodies can be measured using different coordinate systems. Heliocentric coordinates place the Sun at the center, while barycentric coordinates consider the center of mass of the entire Solar System (the barycenter) as the reference point. In the given context, Neptune was said to have completed a full barycentric orbit, meaning it returned to its discovery position with respect to the Solar System's barycenter. However, due to the Sun's motion around this barycenter, Neptune did not return to its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun (i.e., in the heliocentric coordinate system). The discovery longitude in the heliocentric coordinate system was reached a day later, on 12 July 2011. So, the combination of the Earth's changing position in its orbit and the difference between heliocentric and barycentric coordinate systems resulted in Neptune not appearing at its exact discovery position on 11 July 2011."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Arrest after Arkansas Realtor Beverly Carter vanishes (CNN) -- A manhunt for a 33-year-old sought in connection with the disappearance of an Arkansas real estate agent ended with his arrest Monday, police say. The Little Rock Police Department arrested Arron Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, after an arrest warrant issued Sunday said he was charged with kidnapping. The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter. Carter went to show a home in the city of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished. Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police, while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Police took Arron Lewis' photo after a Sunday traffic accident. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident and \\"Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,\\" the report says. Another witness told police that \\"the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,\\" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said. \\"While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,\\" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They were to resume their search Monday. The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he \\"knew something was wrong.\\" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the sheriff's office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The sheriff's office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. \\"I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,\\" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. \\"She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.\\" The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that \\"I would just like to have my wife back.\\" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said. CNN's John Branch and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","output":"A manhunt for a 33-year-old, Arron Lewis, in connection with the disappearance of an Arkansas real estate agent, Beverly Carter, ended with his arrest.

He was so dazed with fear as not to know what he was about, and mechanically he began to do as he was bidden.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering  through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides  on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal  wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Question: Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because   _  . Answer: The answer is:","output":"Some two thousand million years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because another star came near to our sun. The proximity of this wandering star would have likely caused large tides on the sun's surface, similar to how the sun and moon cause tides on Earth. As this star came closer to the sun, these tides would have crafted a high mountain. As the star moved away, its powerful tidal pull tore the mountain into small pieces and hurled them into space. These pieces have been orbiting the sun ever since and they became what we now know as planets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines... A:","output":"In the movie Sucker Punch, Babydoll notes five items that she needs to collect in order to escape the asylum. These items are: 1. A Map: This item is crucial for planning their escape route from the institution. It provides the necessary information for navigating through the building, corridors, and any possible obstacles they might encounter along the way. 2. Fire: Fire is necessary for creating a diversion, causing chaos, or destroying some of the obstacles the girls may encounter during their escape. This element can be used to create explosions or simply catch the attention of the staff, allowing the girls to proceed with their escape plan without being detected. 3. A Knife: A weapon is essential to defend themselves or attack when needed during the escape. The knife, being a versatile and easy-to-conceal weapon, is a suitable choice for the girls, especially considering the confined spaces they may encounter inside the asylum. 4. A Key: The key is fundamental to unlock doors and bypass security measures put in place within the institution. Without the key, Babydoll and her friends would face significant challenges in their attempt to escape, as they might end up trapped in locked rooms or unable to open necessary doors. 5. The Fifth item - \\"A deep sacrifice\\" resulting in a \\"perfect victory\\": The fifth item is not revealed until later in the movie, and it represents a significant emotional or physical sacrifice. The true meaning behind this item becomes apparent as the story unfolds, and it serves as an important thematic element within the overall narrative. By collecting these five items, Babydoll and her friends attempt to devise an escape plan and break free from the confines of the asylum in the movie Sucker Punch. Each item plays a crucial role in moving the plot forward and further developing the characters' struggles and relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery. As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses.

Article: Tulou, the special residential architecture of Fujian Province was included on the UNESCO's World Heritage List during the 32ndsession of the World Heritage Committee in Quebec, Canada. In the fourth century, Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south, gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities. As a defence against enemies, the Hakkas chose to live in compact  communities, and the tulou was their preferred houses. Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province. Most tulous are to be found in the valleys, surrounded by high mountains, and some are in the depths of the great mountains. Most are three to four stories high, and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens, rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms. For defensive purposes, the rooms on the first floor have no windows. Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally. Their main building material was a mixture of clay, sand, lime and water, and egg whites, brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls. Once they dried, the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult. Fir branches, which are extremely strong and do not rot, were used to strengthen them, and many centuries later they have remained their original look. Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently, and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks. The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect, who paid several visits to Yongding, to build a tulou back home. Not long after, an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away, and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down, his tulou remained.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Since even the smallest speck of asbestos can cause health problems, it’s a good idea to completely clear out the room that you’ll be taking a sample from. If you can’t remove all the furniture, then push it far away from the sampling area and cover it all with plastic drop cloths. If you remove a sample from a ceiling, then asbestos particles can become airborne if you have air circulating in the room. To keep this from happening, turn off your heating or cooling system. Shut any windows or doors and keep any fans turned off. Wear coveralls or outer clothing that you won’t mind throwing away after taking the sample. You can usually buy disposable coveralls for 5-10 at your local hardware store. Wear heavy disposable gloves as well. And, put on a breathing mask (a paper one is fine) and goggles, too. It’s bad to let asbestos touch your skin, so keep totally covered.  Remember that you’ll need to toss everything that you’ve worn on the outside, including goggles and gloves. So, don’t spend a lot on them. While you are taking the sample and before you’ve fully cleaned up, don’t let anyone else in the room. Get industrial plastic sheeting from your hardware store. Place this sheeting on the floor directly under where you’ll take the sample. Use duct tape to secure the sheeting to the floor, so that it won’t shift around. Set your ladder directly on top of the sheeting and under where you’ll take the sample. When you’ve finished placing the plastic, get a spray bottle and mist the whole space with water. This helps to keep any dust particles from floating around. It’s not necessary to saturate any surfaces, just a quick spraying will do fine.","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on preparing a room for asbestos sampling, emphasizing safety precautions such as clearing the space, turning off air circulation, wearing disposable protective gear, isolating the sampling area with plastic sheeting, and using a spray bottle to minimize airborne particles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. a good answer to this question?","output":"Answer: The question addresses the intent and initiatives concerning the schooling of young children, particularly in regions where child labor is prevalent, and schooling opportunities are limited. The provided statement, which highlights a time-bounded program in countries with high child labor rates and insufficient schooling opportunities, is only part of the equation. To truly answer the question, a more comprehensive analysis of various objectives and strategies for enhancing the education of young children is required. Several key initiatives and goals that various governments, organizations, and stakeholders want to achieve concerning the education of young children are as follows: 1. Universal access to quality education: The primary objective when it comes to schooling for young children is to ensure that all children, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have access to quality education. This initiative strives to eliminate child labor and other social barriers that prevent children from attending school. 2. Early childhood education: Another critical aspect of young children's education is providing early childhood education, which plays a vital role in laying a solid foundation for learning and personal development. Ensuring that quality early childhood programs are implemented in all countries is a significant goal to strive for. 3. Curriculum development and enhancement: The schooling of young children should involve an age-appropriate and well-rounded curriculum that focuses not only on core subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics but also on life skills, social development, and cultural awareness. This approach aims to provide children with the knowledge and skills they need to become responsible, informed, and engaged citizens. 4. Effective teacher training and support: A crucial aspect of providing quality education for young children is having well-trained and capable educators who can effectively teach and guide them. Investing in teacher training and continuous professional development is necessary for ensuring that educators have the necessary tools and skills to shape young minds. 5. Parent and community engagement: Involving parents and community members in the education process helps create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. Initiatives should include parental education on the importance of schooling, as well as promoting community-based programs and resources that foster educational engagement and success. 6. Monitoring and evaluation: To continually improve educational systems and ensure that all young children receive adequate schooling, it is crucial to establish effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. This process allows for the identification of shortcomings, addressing inequalities, and implementing improvements to provide equitable opportunities for all children. 7. Resource allocation and funding: Adequate funding and resource allocation are vital for implementing the strategies mentioned above and ensuring quality education for young children. Collaborative efforts from governments, organizations, and stakeholders are necessary to invest in education, establish proper infrastructure, allocate funding, and prioritize resources to improve schooling opportunities for young children in areas where it is most needed. In conclusion, while the time-bounded program for countries with high child labor rates and limited schooling opportunities is an essential measure, it is not the full answer to the question. More comprehensive initiatives, such as ensuring universal access to quality education, promoting early childhood education, curriculum development, teacher training, parent and community engagement, monitoring and evaluation, and ensuring adequate resource allocation, all play a vital role in improving the schooling of young children worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Species in this subgenus are:  - The tomato (see pronunciation) is the edible fruit of \\"Solanum lycopersicum\\", commonly known as a tomato plant, which belongs to the nightshade family, \\"Solanaceae\\". The species originated in Central and South America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word \\"tomatl\\" gave rise to the Spanish word \\"tomate\\", from which the English word tomato originates. Numerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately . Its use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables, being ingredients of savory meals.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, roots, and bark at other times. The genus is also called \\"meadow voles\\". (ITIS database) The species are: Subgenus \\"Microtus\\" Subgenus \\"Terricola\\" Subgenus \\"Mynomes\\" Subgenus \\"Alexandromys\\" Subgenus \\"Stenocranius\\" Subgenus \\"Pitymys\\" Subgenus \\"Pedomys\\" Subgenus \\"Hyrcanicola\\"  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola . They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia . A water vole found in Western North America was historically considered a member of this genus , but has been shown to be more closely related to members of the genus Microtus ( Conroy and Cook , 2000 ; Musser and Carleton , 2005 ) . Head and body length are 12 -- 22 cm , tail length is 6.5 -- 12.5 cm , and the weight is 70 -- 250 g. The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth . They are thick - furred and have hairy fringe on feet that improves their swimming ability .  - Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are:  - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.  - A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.  - Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: References. D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference. Third Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.  - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - In biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.

Televisions, gaming consoles, sound systems, and more – most of these devices now support HDMI connections. But what if you have a non-HDMI device? Worry not! This article will guide you through the process of connecting your non-HDMI device to an HDMI TV.  Step 1: Identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI device Before you can connect your non-HDMI device to an HDMI TV, you need to identify an HDMI-compatible port on your device. Common ports that are HDMI-compatible include DVI (Digital Visual Interface), VGA (Video Graphics Array), and DisplayPort. Check your device's manual or do a quick search online to confirm which type of port your device supports. Step 2: Choose the right cable or adapter Once you have identified an HDMI-compatible port on your device, it's time to choose the right cable or adapter. Based on the type of port, you will need either an HDMI-to-DVI cable, HDMI-to-VGA cable, or HDMI-to-DisplayPort cable. Alternatively, you can use a standalone adapter that converts the respective signal to HDMI and then use a regular HDMI cable to connect the adapter to your HDMI TV. Ensure to select a cable or adapter that supports the transmission of audio signals as well if your port supports it. Step 3: Connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV Now that you have the appropriate cable or adapter, locate an available HDMI port on your television. After locating the port, insert the HDMI-A plug from your cable or adapter into the HDMI port on your TV. Step 4: Connect the other end of the cable to the device or adapter Take the other end of your cable and connect it to the HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI device. If you are using a standalone adapter, connect your non-HDMI device to the adapter using the appropriate cable (such as DVI, VGA, or DisplayPort) and then connect the HDMI end of the adapter to your HDMI TV. Step 5: Switch to the HDMI source on your TV After you have connected both ends of the cable or adapter, power on your non-HDMI device and your television. Use your TV's remote control to navigate to the correct HDMI input source. Typically, there is a button labeled \\"Source,\\" \\"Input,\\" or \\"Menu\\" on your remote. Press this button and cycle through the available sources until you find the correct HDMI input that corresponds to the port you connected your non-HDMI device. Step 6: Hook up the audio separately if necessary In some instances, especially with older devices or certain port types, the audio signal may not be transmitted along with the video signal. If this is the case for your specific setup, you will need to connect the audio separately using an appropriate cable. Most commonly, you may require a 3.5mm audio cable (also known as an AUX cable) or an RCA cable, depending on your device's audio output options. Connect the audio cable to the respective audio output on your non-HDMI device and the corresponding audio input ports on your HDMI TV. Conclusion It's easy to feel left behind in a world that increasingly relies on HDMI technology. However, with the steps outlined above, you can easily connect your non-HDMI devices to your HDMI TV and fully enjoy the high-quality audio and video experience that the technology has to offer. Remember to verify your device's compatibility, choose the correct cable or adapter, and follow the connection process step by step.

Background: David \\"Davy\\" Crockett (August 17, 1786 - March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier, and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet \\"King of the Wild Frontier\\". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Texas Revolution. Crockett grew up in East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling. Context: On October 25, 1824, Crockett notified his constituents of his intention to run in the 1825 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost that election to incumbent Adam Rankin Alexander. A chance meeting in 1826 gained him the encouragement of Memphis mayor Marcus Brutus Winchester to try again to win a seat in Congress. The Jackson Gazette published a letter from Crockett on September 15, 1826 announcing his intention of again challenging Rankin, and stating his opposition to the policies of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay and to Rankin's position on the cotton tariff. Militia veteran William Arnold also entered the race, and Crockett easily defeated both political opponents for the 1827-29 term. He arrived in Washington D.C. and took up residence at Mrs. Ball's Boarding House, where a number of other legislators lived when Congress was in session. Jackson was elected as President in 1828. Crockett continued his legislative focus on settlers getting a fair deal for land titles, offering H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk.  Crockett was re-elected for the 1829-31 session, once again defeating Adam Rankin Alexander. He introduced H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was defeated on May 3. On February 25, 1830, he introduced a resolution to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York because he felt that it was public money going to benefit the sons of wealthy men. He spoke out against Congress giving 100,000 to the widow of Stephen Decatur, citing that Congress was not empowered to do that. He opposed Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act and was the only member of the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. Cherokee chief John Ross sent him a letter on January 13, 1831 expressing his thanks for Crockett's vote. His vote was not popular with his own district, and he was defeated in the 1831 election by William Fitzgerald.  Crockett ran against Fitzgerald again in the 1833 election and was returned to Congress, serving until 1835. On January 2, 1834, he introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126, but it never made it as far as being debated on the House floor. He was defeated for re-election in the August 1835 election by Adam Huntsman. During his last term in Congress, he collaborated with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton to write his autobiography, which was published by E. L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself, and he went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quotation attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state:  I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas. Question: what did he do in the house. Whats the answer?","output":"Davy Crockett was a man who lived a long time ago and was a part of the group of people who helped make important decisions for the country. This group is called the House of Representatives. He fought for the rights of people who settled in new lands, making sure they were treated fairly when they bought land. He also tried to make changes to some laws, but not all of them worked out. Mr. Crockett believed that everyone, not just rich people, should have the same opportunities, so he tried to make the government spend money fairly. He also didn't like how some Native American tribes were being treated, so he voted against a law that would remove them from their homes. Even though he didn't always win, Davy Crockett worked hard for what he thought was right."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Percy was an auto mechanic and race car driver who, like his son, suffered from obesity (he weighed over 350 pounds), and died while attempting a 100-day diet. His family was Jewish. Sherman's parents divorced when he was in grade school, and the son adopted his mother's maiden name. Context: One track from My Son, the Nut, a spoof of summer camp entitled \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\", became a surprise novelty hit, reaching No. 2 on the national Billboard Hot 100 chart for three weeks in late summer 1963. The lyrics were sung to the tune of one segment of Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours, familiar to the public because of its use in the Walt Disney film Fantasia. That December, Sherman's \\"The Twelve Gifts of Christmas\\" single appeared on Billboard's separate Christmas chart. Sherman had one other Top 40 hit, a 1965 take-off on the Petula Clark hit \\"Downtown\\" called \\"Crazy Downtown\\", which spent one week at #40. Two other Sherman singles charted in the lower regions of the Billboard 100: an updated \\"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh\\" (#59 in 1964), and \\"The Drinking Man's Diet\\" (#98 in 1965). Sherman's \\"The End of a Symphony\\", spotlighting Arthur Fiedler's Boston Pops Orchestra, reached #113 on the \\"Bubbling Under\\" chart in 1964, but did not make the Hot 100.  The songs on Sherman's next album My Name Is Allan (1965) were thematically connected: except for a couple of original novelty songs with music by Sherman and Busch, all the songs on the album are parodies of songs that had won, or were nominated for, the Academy Award for Best Song. They included \\"That Old Black Magic\\", \\"Secret Love\\", \\"The Continental\\", \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" and \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\". The cover of the album bore a childhood photograph of Sherman. That, and the album's title, were references to Barbra Streisand's album My Name Is Barbra, released earlier that year, which featured a cover photograph of the singer as a young girl.  During his brief heyday, Sherman's parodies were so popular that he had at least one contemporary imitator: My Son the Copycat was an album of song parodies performed by Stanley Ralph Ross, co-written by Ross and Bob Arbogast. Lest there be any doubt of whom Ross is copying, his album's cover bears a crossed-out photo of Sherman. One of the songs on this album is a fat man's lament, \\"I'm Called Little Butterball\\", parodying \\"I'm Called Little Buttercup\\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta HMS Pinafore. Sherman would later parody this same song as \\"Little Butterball\\" - with the same subject matter - on his album Allan in Wonderland. The song may have had more poignancy for Sherman, as he, unlike Stanley Ross, was genuinely overweight. Sherman also parodied Gilbert and Sullivan's \\"Titwillow\\" from The Mikado, in the song \\"The Bronx Bird-Watcher\\" (on My Son, the Celebrity), as well as several other Gilbert and Sullivan songs. Question: Did he have other hits?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Allan Sherman had other hits besides \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh.\\" Some of his other popular songs include \\"Crazy Downtown,\\" which reached #40 on the charts, \\"The Twelve Gifts of Christmas,\\" \\"The Drinking Man's Diet,\\" and \\"The End of a Symphony.\\" He was known for his funny song parodies, and his album \\"My Name Is Allan\\" featured many parodies of popular songs from movies. So, Allan Sherman had several hits that made people laugh and enjoy his music."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rest of the players, including the hammy Naschy, are a complete write-off (though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing). Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf/Frankenstein/Dr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous (at least in the English version), that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed. Zabalza's direction seems jerky, even amateurish. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's over-bright lighting. Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, though the stridently over-emphatic music score and the laughably crude, totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.","output":"Step 1: Read the text thoroughly to understand the tone and message.

Pick your answer from: A). talk to sasha B). hate sasha C). refuse to know sasha Answer:","output":"Carson needs to A). talk to Sasha before checking her mailbox for her, as it is important to obtain her consent and ensure that she is comfortable with him performing this favor. Before Carson can check Sasha's mailbox for her, there are several steps he needs to follow. This includes communication, trust-building, understanding her needs, and maintaining boundaries. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps Carson should take: 1. Establish a rapport with Sasha: If they're not already friends or acquaintances, Carson should first attempt to create a friendly environment for conversation. This can be done by engaging in small talk, finding common interests, or simply by being open and approachable. 2. Assess Sasha's need for assistance: Before offering to do any favors for Sasha, Carson should determine whether she indeed requires help. This can be done by listening to her concerns, understanding her schedule and availability, and evaluating whether checking her mailbox is something she might actually need assistance with. It's important for Carson to not just assume that she needs help, but to genuinely understand her situation. 3. Offer to help: Once Carson has determined that Sasha might need help with her mailbox, he should kindly offer his assistance. He should clearly communicate that he's willing to check her mailbox for her, making sure to specify when he's available, and explaining his reasons or motivations for offering the favor. This not only provides transparency but also allows Sasha to make an informed decision. 4. Obtain consent: It's important for Carson to get Sasha's permission to perform this favor. He should ask for her explicit consent and ensure that she's comfortable with him checking her mailbox. Her consent should not be assumed or coerced, as it's crucial to prioritize her comfort and privacy. 5. Set boundaries: If Sasha agrees to let Carson check her mailbox, they should both establish some ground rules and boundaries. This may include discussing the frequency of the checks, any limitations regarding handling or opening her mail (if applicable), and any additional preferences that Sasha may have. This allows both parties to have a clear understanding of the expectations and prevents any potential misunderstandings. 6. Show respect and maintain trust: Once Carson has her consent, he should carry out the favor in a reliable and respectful manner, ensuring that he abides by the established boundaries and communicates with Sasha regularly. Showing respect and maintaining trust are key factors in building a lasting and positive relationship. By talking to Sasha and understanding her needs, Carson demonstrates his willingness to help and his respect for her privacy. This, in turn, allows him to perform the favor, thus fostering a supportive and trusting relationship between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Therefore, though the given statement \\"A man is looking through a microscope\\" is true, it does not fully confirm or ascertain the truthfulness of the entire premise: \\"A man in a US Army uniform looks through a microscope as a scientist in a lab coat looks over his shoulder.\\" Let's break the premise down into its constituent elements: 1.

If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3]  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the moon than on earth\\" is \\"The moons gravity is weaker than earth's?\\"? OPT: [-] no; [-] yes;","output":"First, let's compute the weight of a person with a mass of 50 kg on Earth. In order to do that, we will use the formula: Weight = Mass × Gravity On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². Therefore, the weight of the person on Earth would be: Weight = 50 kg × 9.81 m/s² Weight ≈ 490.5 N (Newtons) Now, let's discuss the force of gravity and how it changes. You are correct in stating that the force of gravity is the same everywhere on Earth, but it varies on other planetary bodies like the Moon. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the planetary body and the distance between the object and the center of the planetary body. When astronauts travel from Earth to other celestial bodies within our solar system, including the Moon, the strength of the gravitational force changes. As you mentioned, astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. and Neil Armstrong were the first humans to walk on the Moon, and an astronaut weighs less on the Moon than they do on Earth because the Moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's. This is due to the Moon having only about 1/6th of Earth's gravity. The mass of an object does not change when it goes from one place to another because mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object, and this remains constant no matter where the object is located. The concept of weight, on the other hand, varies with the force of gravity. Consequently, the astronaut's mass did not change when he was on the Moon compared to when he was on Earth. Given that the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth and 29 pounds on the Moon, if his mass on Earth was 80 kg, his mass on the Moon would also be 80 kg, as mass does not change based on location. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"Why does an astronaut weigh less on the Moon than on Earth?\\" is \\"The Moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's.\\" Your understanding of the relationship between mass, weight, and the force of gravity is accurate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are on a whaling boat in search of whales. Donald tries to eat a sandwich for lunch, but seagulls bother and harass him to get the sandwich and end up eating most of it. While Donald is preoccupied with fighting off the gulls, a pelican eats the remainder of the sandwich. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to pitch a bucket of water off the ship, but it keeps coming back to him, to his annoyance. Donald and Goofy spot a sleeping whale, but Goofy's efforts to shoot a harpoon keep failing because he doesn't have all the tools needed (at one point, he sets his own bottom on fire). He eventually succeeds in launching the anchor in plaace of the harpoon, but his foot gets caught in the attached line and when the anchor hits an iceberg he ends up hanging from the line above the whale's head. Donald rushes to Goofy's rescue, but isn't fast enough and Goofy falls off the line, through the whale's blowhole, and ends up in the whale's mouth. Lighting a match so he can see better, Goofy inadvertently wakes the whale up and it starts coughing. A wave comes in through the whale's open mouth and washes Goofy around. He gets blown out of the whale's blowhole and falls back down, his head getting stuck in the blowhole. Meanwhile, Donald falls into the water and is chased by the angry whale back to the ship, where, after Donald is nearly eaten, the whale rams and destroys the ship. Mickey, Donald and Goofy fly through the air and land on a small raft made of the ship's debris. Goofy ends up with a fish in his hands, and, believing it is the whale, says, \\"Gosh, must have shrunk!\\" The answer is:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, there are two kinds of birds that eat Donald Duck's sandwich: seagulls and a pelican.  The seagulls are described as bothersome and persistent, continually harassing Donald in an attempt to get his sandwich. They ultimately succeed in eating most of the sandwich, demonstrating their determination and opportunistic nature. Seagulls are often found around coastal areas and are known for their scavenging behavior, particularly when it comes to human food, which explains their interest in Donald's sandwich. In addition to the seagulls, a pelican also consumes a part of Donald Duck's sandwich. While Donald is preoccupied with keeping the seagulls at bay, the pelican swoops in and eats the remainder of the sandwich. Pelicans are large aquatic birds known for their long beaks and large throat pouches, which they use to scoop up fish (and apparently sandwiches). They are somewhat more opportunistic and less aggressive than seagulls but are still known to snatch food when the opportunity arises. In summary, the kinds of birds that eat Donald Duck's sandwich in the article are seagulls and a pelican. The seagulls harass him in an attempt to steal the sandwich, while the pelican capitalizes on the situation and consumes the remaining portion of the sandwich. Both types of birds demonstrate opportunistic and scavenging behavior, showcasing their adaptability and resourcefulness in acquiring food, even from unusual sources like a cartoon character's sandwich."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the audience listens attentively, the man in the blue shirt elaborates on the biomechanics involved in this seemingly simple but oftentimes challenging skill. With a passion for the sport clearly evident in his voice, he explains that the key to handling high balls effectively is maintaining a proper stance, in which a player's feet are shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. This allows them to react quickly and maintain balance while keeping their eyes focused on the incoming ball. In addition to proper body positioning, the man emphasizes the role of grip strength in securing the racket handle. A firm and consistent grip allows for better control over the trajectory of the ball. He also demonstrates the importance of following through on the swing to ensure that the racket stays in contact with the ball for as long as possible, leading to a more powerful and accurate shot. Elaborating on the role of the forearm in this process, the man in the blue shirt points out that it acts as a lever, helping to accelerate the racket head through the contact point with the ball. He suggests practicing small, controlled forearm movements to improve muscle memory and increase overall agility in high-pressure situations on the tennis court. He then shifts the focus to the importance of anticipating the ball's trajectory and adjusting one's position accordingly. By staying light on their toes and engaging their leg muscles, players can make it easier for their arms and forearms to do the work when the moment of contact arrives. As the man in the blue shirt wraps up his presentation, he emphasizes that mastering these techniques is crucial for both amateur and professional tennis players who wish to excel in their game. By integrating the proper use of their forearms with other essential components - such as footwork, body positioning, and anticipation - players can significantly improve their ability to handle high balls and gain a substantial competitive edge over their opponents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation caused by a great deal of underground activity affecting less or smaller eruptions can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process in the formation and eruption of a volcano.  To elaborate further, let's first understand the process of volcanic eruption step by step: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are produced during different geological processes. These gases accumulate underneath the Earth's surface, leading to an increase in pressure. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As the pressure beneath the earth increases, it forces magma, a molten or semi-molten rock material, upward through fissures or cracks in the Earth's crust. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools down and forms volcanic rocks. Over time, these solidified rocks gradually build up and form a volcanic edifice. 4. With enough time the pressure builds up greatly: If the pressure from the gases continues to increase over time, a significant build-up of pressure occurs beneath the volcano. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: When the pressure becomes too high, it can cause a volcanic eruption. The magma and gases escape from the volcano, producing various eruption styles, from smaller and less violent eruptions to large and explosive ones. Now, let's consider the effect of increased underground activity on smaller eruptions. The increased underground activity, such as seismic events, tectonic plate movements, or increased heat flow, can impact magma generation and movement, as well as gas pressure beneath the Earth's crust. This may change the style and magnitude of eruptions but does not directly impact any specific step of the process. As a result, the underground activity can have an indirect effect on the process of volcanic eruptions. For instance, increased underground activity could cause fractures or faults in the Earth's crust, providing new pathways for magma and gases to escape, thus potentially reducing the buildup of pressure that may have led to a larger eruption. Alternatively, it may cause local changes in the magma chamber, altering the composition and viscosity of the magma, which may affect the eruption style and produce smaller or less frequent eruptions. In conclusion, a great deal of underground activity might indirectly impact a step of the volcanic eruption process, leading to changes in the scale and style of eruptions, including less or smaller eruptions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: LaDainian Tomlinson made history by becoming the fastest running back to reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexander's single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexander's mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222&#160;yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denver's Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter to make it a 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elam's 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like last week against the Bengals, the Chargers wouldn't say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 at the end of the third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos' cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos' lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummer's 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen. The Broncos' hopes for overtime ended when Plummer was sacked by Shaun Phillips and time ran out, giving San Diego their first win in Denver in 7 years as well as sole position of first place in the AFC West and improved their record to 8-2.

Her other daughters Maggie (Lauren Graham) and Mae (Piper Perabo) are happily married but Milly has recently broken up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned. Daphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter.

Which entity is this text about? Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013.  In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.  During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.  Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr.  On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.

Questions: He was eating too much while no exercising enough, what did he suffer as a result? Options: - hungry - gas - obesity - gain weight - feeling full Answer:","output":"He was eating too much while not exercising enough, and as a result, he suffered from obesity and gain weight. These two outcomes are aligned with common sense since excessive eating and a sedentary lifestyle directly contribute to an increase in body fat and weight gain. When a person consumes more calories than they burn through physical activity, the surplus calories are stored as body fat. If this behavior continues for an extended period, it can lead to significant weight gain and obesity. Obesity is a medical condition characterized by an excessive amount of body fat. It can increase the risk of various health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While the other options might be partially correct in certain instances, they don't fully capture the result of the person's behavior. For example, feeling hungry or full can be temporary sensations experienced during the day, whereas gas may be experienced occasionally due to various factors like consuming gas-producing foods. However, these options do not necessarily suggest a long-term pattern of consistently eating too much and not exercising enough. Hence, obesity and gain weight are the options most in line with common sense to answer the question about the consequences of overeating and insufficient exercise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The silver accessory around her neck glinted in the stage lights, but in a different way from the bling worn by many of the other contestants. In a sight that to many was pretty refreshing amidst a sea of sequins, stilettos and jewels, Johnson emerged onto the stage in blue scrubs and sneakers. She complimented her outfit with the only necklace that goes best with scrubs -- a stethoscope.      Her attire simply reflected what all nurses are required to wear. But apparently, Joy Behar, one of the hosts of \\"The View,\\" was completely unaware of this fact.

She describes how she originally felt as if she were \\"just a nurse,\\" but Joe made her realize that she is so much more than that.      \\"Why is she wearing a doctor's stethoscope?\\" Behar asked when Johnson's photo came on the screen behind the hosts, ironically mirroring the very sentiment that Johnson was speaking out against.      \\"The View\\" has removed the clip of Behar's comments and the table discussion of Johnson's monologue, but has yet to issue any sort of apology to the nursing profession.

Options: a ) 6 , b ) 8 1 / 1 , c ) 8 1 / 4 , d ) 8 1 / 2 , e ) 8 3 / 7","output":"To calculate when the cistern will be filled, first, we need to find the combined rate of the pipes filling the cistern. Pipe A fills the cistern in 12 minutes, so it fills 1/12 of the cistern per minute. Pipe B fills the cistern in 15 minutes, so it fills 1/15 of the cistern per minute. When both pipes are opened together, they fill: (1/12 + 1/15) of the cistern per minute. This simplifies to: (15 + 12) / (12 * 15) = 27 / 180 = 3/20 So, together they fill 3/20 of the cistern per minute. They work together for 4 minutes and fill: 4 * (3/20) = 12/20 or 3/5 of the cistern. Now, 2/5 of the cistern still needs to be filled, and as A is turned off, B works alone. Since Pipe B fills 1/15 of the cistern per minute, we can calculate the time it takes to fill 2/5 of the cistern: (2/5) / (1/15) = 2/5 * 15/1 = 6 So it takes 6 more minutes for Pipe B to fill the remaining 2/5 of the cistern.

As one of the most influential artists in the contemporary music scene, Annie Lennox started her journey to fame and success when she co-founded the successful pop band Eurythmics. Eurythmics was formed by Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart in 1980. Annie Lennox began her career in music at a young age.

Before the formation of Eurythmics, Lennox was involved in a few bands, including Dragon's Playground and The Tourists. It was in the latter where she first met Stewart. However, The Tourists disbanded in 1980, prompting Lennox and Stewart to form their own group, Eurythmics. Eurythmics quickly gained popularity with their unique sound, combining electronic music with Lennox's powerful vocals. Their first studio album, \\"In The Garden,\\" was released in 1981, but it wasn't until their 1983 album, \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),\\" that they attained significant commercial success. The title track became a worldwide hit, and Annie Lennox's striking androgynous image in the music video made her a visual icon as well.

His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?, what is it ?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\"?

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the truth value of both sentences, let's first analyze their content and context.  Sentence 1: \\"Yeah, wait for it to come out on videotape, I guess.\\" - In this sentence, the speaker seems to be suggesting that the listener should wait for something to come out on videotape. The phrase \\"I guess\\" indicates some uncertainty or lack of enthusiasm in the speaker's suggestion. Sentence 2: \\"Wait for it to come out on video.\\" - This sentence also suggests waiting for something to come out on video. It is more direct and clear compared to the first sentence. Now, let's analyze if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Step 1: Determine the truth value of Sentence 1. - If we consider the given scenario and assume that Sentence 1 is true, then it means the speaker indeed recommends waiting for the thing in question to come out on videotape. Step 2: Compare the content of both sentences. - Both sentences focus on the same action: \\"waiting for something to come out on video.\\" Step 3: Determine the truth value of Sentence 2. - Given that both sentences suggest waiting for something on video, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 should be true as well. The only difference in phrasing is videotape vs video, which can be interpreted to represent the same idea in this context.

The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids.

Answer this question: who came up with the affordable care act??","output":"The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a comprehensive healthcare reform legislation in the United States that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The development of the ACA took place over a period of time and involved the contributions of numerous individuals, organizations, and political parties. However, the primary architects of the law were members of the Obama administration and Democratic Party, with President Obama playing a central role in its conception and promotion. The idea of healthcare reform had been a long-standing goal within the Democratic Party, with previous attempts dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and later President Harry S. Truman. The most recent serious attempt at reform took place under President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s, but his proposal, led by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, ultimately failed to pass due to political opposition. After his election in 2008, President Barack Obama made healthcare reform a top priority for his administration. He appointed key personnel within his administration who would play crucial roles in shaping the ACA, such as Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services and Nancy-Ann DeParle as Director of the White House Office of Health Reform. The legislation itself was primarily drafted by congressional Democrats, including the late Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Henry Waxman, with input from health policy experts, interest groups, and stakeholders. The ACA was heavily influenced by the Massachusetts health care reform law, which was enacted in 2006 under then-Governor Mitt Romney. Many of the ACA's key provisions, such as the individual mandate and the establishment of health insurance exchanges, were borrowed from the Massachusetts model. The Obama administration also sought input from conservative-leaning policy experts and organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation, in the hopes of achieving bipartisan support for the legislation. Throughout the crafting and debate of the ACA, President Obama and his administration worked with various stakeholders, such as insurance companies, hospitals, and physician groups, in order to address their concerns and gain their support for the legislation. He also held numerous public events and speeches to promote and explain his vision for healthcare reform to the American people. Despite efforts to reach bipartisan consensus, the process of passing the ACA in Congress was highly partisan, with no Republicans voting in favor of the bill. After a lengthy and contentious debate, the House of Representatives passed the ACA on March 21, 2010, and it was signed into law by President Obama two days later. In summary, while numerous individuals, organizations, and political figures contributed to the development and passage of the Affordable Care Act, its primary architects were President Barack Obama and key members of his administration, working in collaboration with congressional Democrats and various stakeholders within the healthcare industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Mobu tried to bring back to life?  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. Answer:","output":"Bernie Lomax"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2001, John Dugan, who had coached the Express in 2000, became the new head coach of the Atlanta Silverbacks. He promptly signed Armas. On June 12, 2001, half way through the season, the Silverbacks traded Armas to the Minnesota Thunder in a three-way trade which sent Andrew Restrepo from the Rochester Rhinos to Atlanta and Stoian Mladenov to the Rhinos from Minnesota. In 2002, Armas played three games with the Cincinnati Riverhawks. In 2003, he played seventeen games for the Carolina Dynamo, scoring five goals and adding 16 assists as the Dynamo took the league title. Armas was selected as a first team All Star. He then moved to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds for the 2004 USL Second Division season and was back with Carolina for the 2005 season.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across.

McCarthy Answer:","output":"Title: Secrets in Shadows Synopsis: Secrets in Shadows is a gripping mystery drama set in the small town of McCarthy, Alaska, where nothing is as it seems. The film revolves around a series of mysterious events, unraveling buried secrets, deeply rooted betrayals, and twisted relationships, which all come to a head in a shocking climax. Plot: The story begins with Jessica Shaw, a budding journalist from New York, visiting McCarthy, Alaska, to spend a couple of months with her estranged aunt, Susan Turner. Jessica is seeking solace after the tragic death of her sister, Leah, and hopes to find peace while gathering information for a book she is working on about small-town life. Upon arrival in McCarthy, Jessica quickly realizes that the town is shrouded in mystery and whispers, with its less than welcoming townsfolk reluctant to share their stories. The town's economy primarily relies on tourism, hosting a goldmine that was once prosperous but now lies defunct, leaving some residents bitterly resentful. During her first week in McCarthy, Jessica stumbles upon a series of old newspaper clippings about a decades-old unsolved murder case. Intrigued, she decides to explore the story deeper and searches for people connected to the victim named Allison Turner, who was Susan's cousin and a prominent resident of McCarthy. Jessica interviews those who were close to Allison. Some individuals seem to have hazy memories of the case, while others are not willing to share any information. This silence fuels Jessica's curiosity, as she starts to delve deeper. After a few weeks, she finds a key witness who had kept quiet all these years, fearing for her life. Jessica gains her trust and discovers that the witness saw a shadowy figure the night Allison disappeared. Through her relentless investigation, Jessica soon uncovers that Allison was romantically involved with three men before her death, which led to a love triangle that escalated to jealousy, betrayal, and finally murder. As she continues to unravel the twisted relationships, she encounters some dangerous red herrings and finds herself too close for comfort to the killer. Parallelly, Jessica's relationship with her aunt Susan unfolds as Susan shares her own story about the family's dark past, revealing secrets untold. Jessica learns that her mother had left McCarthy and cut ties with Susan years ago, partially due to the fallout surrounding Allison's murder. As Jessica becomes more entwined with McCarthy's residents, she finds allies in Jason, the local bartender with a troubled past and Natalie, a young nurse with a bright outlook on life. Together, they work to exhume the buried history, confront the truth, and determine what really happened to Allison Turner on that fateful night. Confrontations occur between the suspects, their secrets are exposed, and the town of McCarthy is forced to confront its own dark past. As Jessica closes in on the truth, the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place, culminating in a heart-stopping revelation that alters the lives of all involved in Secrets in Shadows. Throughout the film, the beauty of Alaska provides a contrasting backdrop to the darkness hidden within the town. The movie explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the the strength of family bonds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: The Red Shoes Movie plot: Based on a Hans Christian Andersen  fairy tale about a pair of enchanted crimson ballet slippers, 'The Red Shoes'  follows the beautiful Vicky Page (Moira Shearer), a young socialite who loves ballet, the rising composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) whom she loves, and her dictatorial director, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook).After attracting the attention of the famous Director, and earning respect and admiration from her colleagues, Vicky is promised by Lermontov that- ''You shall dance, and the world shall follow'' -but only on the agreement that she will dance, and he will control everything else.On this basis, Vicky rises to fame as the prima ballerina in a world- class Ballet Company. However, Lermontov discovers the romance between his talented composer and his beautiful protege, and he cruelly dictates that Vicky must give up Julian or the dancing. He is shocked, and hurt when she marries Julian, and leaves the company, but remains convinced that she will return to him.Vicky does miss her dancing, and when she is offered the chance to dance 'The Red Shoes'  show once more, she attempts to resist, but eventually gives in to Lermontov's alternate bullying and coaxing. Julian is in London, preparing for the premiere of his new work 'Cupid and Psyche', and discovers that his wife has been coaxed back into dancing with the Lermontov Ballet. He is furious, as it appears that Lermontov has convinced her to leave him, and chases after her, arriving as she prepares to dance  'The Red Shoes'  ballet, dishevelled and disbelieving in her dressing room shortly before the performance. She explains that she has missed her dancing, and embraces him, trying to convey wordlessly that she did not want to leave him, but Lermontov enters, and crows his victory over Julian, reinforcing Vicky's apparent betrayal until Julian gives an ultimatum, dancing or their marriage.Vicky is so distressed at the rapidly escalating tension and the competition between the crucial two men in her life that she can only cry broken... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Red Shoes,\\" Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) is a renowned and highly demanding ballet director who plays a significant role in the life of the protagonist, Vicky Page (Moira Shearer). Lermontov discovers Vicky's talent and becomes her mentor, propelling her to stardom as a prima ballerina under his guidance and direction. Lermontov's relationship with Vicky is complex, as he serves not only as her mentor and director but also as a controlling figure in her life. From the outset, it is clear that Lermontov is captivated by Vicky's passion and talent for ballet, and he wants to mold her into the ultimate ballet dancer. In return, he promises her great stardom, stating, \\"You shall dance, and the world shall follow.\\" However, this comes with the condition that she will focus solely on her dance career and allow him full authority over her life. This is the foundation of their intricate relationship. As the movie progresses, Lermontov's feelings toward Vicky seem to border on obsession. He is not only focused on her growth as a dancer but also deeply invested in controlling her personal life. This becomes evident through his disapproval and interference in her relationship with composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring). When Lermontov learns that his protégé and the young composer are in love, he becomes jealous and demands that she choose between dancing and her love for Julian. Despite Lermontov's attempts to control Vicky, she chooses to marry Julian and leave the ballet company, much to Lermontov's dismay. Nonetheless, the pull of her love for dancing remains strong. When she is eventually persuaded to return to the stage and perform in \\"The Red Shoes\\" ballet once again, it is Lermontov who takes advantage of the situation, using a mixture of coercion and persuasion to lure her back. As Vicky struggles to balance her love for ballet and her marriage, the tension between her, Lermontov, and Julian reaches a breaking point. Lermontov's controlling nature and insistence that Vicky dedicate her entire life to her art leads to a tragic conclusion, highlighting the power struggle between the three central characters in the film. In essence, Lermontov is a dominant figure in Vicky's life. He serves as her mentor, director, and, to a significant extent, her tormentor. He demonstrates a relentless drive to control her life both on and off the stage, ultimately pushing Vicky to her breaking point due to the conflicting demands of her dancing career and her personal life. The relationship between Lermontov and Vicky is complex and multi-faceted, illustrating themes of obsession, control, and the potentially destructive nature of artistic ambition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: * no. * yes.","output":"The status of black people in the Roman Empire: The Roman Empire, like many ancient societies, had a wide range of cultural diversity, including citizens and enslaved people from Africa. The Roman Empire was home to people from various ethnic backgrounds, including those from North Africa, Egypt, and other parts of the continent. While many of these people would not be considered \\"black\\" under modern definitions of race, there were certainly individuals of darker skin color residing in Rome. Generally, in the Roman Empire, race was not a major factor determining an individual's social status. Rather than using race as a determinant factor, the Roman Empire placed more emphasis on social class and citizenship status. People were typically divided into various social classes based on their wealth, influence, and political power. Slavery was common, and slaves were often considered the lowest social class, regardless of their ethnic background. It is important to note that people of African origin occupied all levels of society in the Roman Empire. They could be found as slaves, gladiators, soldiers, philosophers, or even Roman senators and emperors. For example, the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus, who ruled from 193 to 211 CE, was of African origin, born in what is present-day Libya. Regarding the Roman Empire's trade: The Roman Empire was known for its extensive trade networks that connected Europe, Africa, and Asia. The empire traded with various regions, engaging in the exchange of numerous goods, materials, and ideas. This trade network allowed Rome to assert its influence and contribute to the wealth and prosperity of the empire. Some of the primary goods traded within and beyond the Roman Empire were: 1. Metals, such as gold, silver, tin, copper, lead, and iron, which were mined in the empire and served as the basis for various industries, including weapons and coin production. 2. Textiles and garments made from materials such as wool, linen, and Egyptian cotton were widely traded along with dyes from the East, like Tyrian purple dye from Phoenicia. 3. Grain was a staple food of the Roman diet, and the empire imported vast quantities of grain, particularly from Egypt and North Africa. These imports ensured a stable food supply for the cities and the Roman military. 4. Luxury items, such as silk, spices, incense, and gems, were mainly imported from the East, with traders traversing long distances on the Silk Road and other trade routes connecting Rome to Arabia, India, and China. 5. Slaves were also traded within the Roman Empire, and enslaved people served various functions in Roman society, such as household servants, field workers, artisans, gladiators, and even entertainment. 6. Various finished products, like pottery, glass, and artworks, were also traded for their aesthetics or functionality. In conclusion, the two questions do not inquire about the same information. The first question discusses the status of black people in the Roman Empire, while the second question addresses the various goods and materials that were traded within and beyond the Roman Empire.

Please answer a question about the following article about Crimean War: Frustrated by the wasted effort, and with demands for action from their citizens, the allied force decided to attack the center of Russian strength in the Black Sea at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula. After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and fought their way to a point south of Sevastopol after a series of successful battles. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, ordered personally by Nicholas, was defeated by Omar Pasha. The front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides.

PA/GETTY Police investigating Madeleine's disappearance have identified a person they want to question      She vanished from her bed in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz while her parents ate a meal nearby with friends just days before her fourth birthday in 2007.      There is just one person who detectives want to speak to who was near to the area where Madeleine disappeared almost 10 years ago Insider      Police said there is one individual they want to speak to who was in the same area of Portugal when she went missing. International intelligence agencies have been working together to find the “person of interest” who detectives believe may hold the key to solving the case. Had the information not been deemed a “solid live lead” then the £13million police investigation would have been wound up.      PA Police have been given an extra £85,000 to follow up the crucial lead      The Home Office last night confirmed that the Metropolitan Police had been awarded an extra £85,000 in operational costs for Operation Grange to continue. A Home Office spokesman said: “Following an application from the Metropolitan Police for special grant funding the Home Office has confirmed £85,000 in operational costs for Operation Grange for the period April 1 until September 2017. “As with all applications the resources required are reviewed regularly and careful consideration is given before any new funding is allocated.” Senior officers admit the investigation of the new lead is the “last throw of the dice” in their hunt. But the Met is taking the development so seriously that leading Whitehall officials are being briefed on its progress. An insider said: “There is just one person who detectives want to speak to who was near to the area where Madeleine disappeared almost 10 years ago. “An international search has been underway to find them.”      GETTY The new funding means Operation Grange will continue until September 2017      Madeleine McCann: The search continues Fri, February 24, 2017 These are the various computer generated images of how Maddie might look now Play slideshow ph 1 of 14 Madeline McCann went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, in Portugal’s Algarve 9 years ago.      Last night Policing Minister Brandon Lewis, who signed off the latest payment, said: “I am pleased to be able to support the British police who are trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Madeleine McCann and give some kind of closure and justice to her family.” At the height of Scotland Yard’s inquiries more than 30 detectives and support staff were working on Operation Grange based at Belgravia police station in central London. When the inquiry was in full swing a team of trained specialists carried out detailed searches of carefully chosen scrubland near where Madeleine was taken from the coastal holiday spot on May 3, 2007. Now Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who leads the small team, has the unenviable task of trying to make a breakthrough with limited resources and a ticking clock before the September cut-off date. Detectives are now confident the net is closing in on the key lead which is why an application was made to the Home Office for extra funding and a stay of execution for the investigation. Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry remain convinced their daughter could still be alive.

He said: \\"There's been a lot of investigation time spent on this terrible case.      \\"It's a child who went missing, everybody wants to know if she is alive and if she is where is she, and sadly if she's dead then we need to give some comfort to the family.      \\"It's needed us to carry out an investigation together with the Portuguese and other countries have been involved.      \\"There is a line of inquiry that remains to be concluded and it's expected that in the coming months that will happen.\\"      Dozens of theories about Madeleine’s disappearance have been explored, including the possibilities she was abducted by a paedophile, killed during a bungled burglary, abducted by traffickers or killed in an accident when she wondered out of the apartment.      As yet the case apparently remains a complete mystery however.

Article: An infographic describing the Deep Carbon Observatory's Carbon Mineral Challenge: A worldwide hunt for new carbon minerals. Credit: DCO/Josh Wood The hunt is on for Earth's undiscovered carbon minerals. Scientists, using statistical calculations, now know how many are out there. They even have some ideas about where to look. But to find them, they need the help of the world's mineral collecting community.      The Carbon Mineral Challenge sets the stage for both professional and amateur mineral collectors to make their mark by discovering never-before described minerals.      Why carbon minerals?      Carbon is one of the most chemically diverse elements, and occurs in compounds with almost every element of the periodic table. Some carbon-containing minerals form ores, which are mined for metals such as iron, nickel, and copper. Carbon-bearing minerals can contain rare Earth elements, critical components of smart phones and tablets. Carbon also becomes coal and diamond. And, most importantly, without carbon, there is no life.      Given the scientific value of potential new carbon-bearing mineral discoveries, the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) is challenging both amateur collectors and professional mineralogists around the world to find these rare specimens.      DCO is a global community of multi-disciplinary scientists unlocking the inner secrets of Earth through investigations into life, energy, and the fundamentally unique chemistry of carbon. A key goal of DCO is to identify the forms of carbon in Earth. Any new carbon minerals discovered as part of the Carbon Mineral Challenge will address this important scientific question, and add to our growing understanding of Earth's unique chemical makeup.      Earth is the only known planet that supports life. Life on Earth has interacted with rocks over billions of years, generating a telltale geobiological footprint. Such a footprint should be visible on other life-supporting planetary bodies.      \\"Figuring out the mineral signature of a life-supporting planet is a really exciting prospect,\\" says Robert Hazen, Senior Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, USA and Executive Director of the Deep Carbon Observatory. \\"Without life, fewer than a third of the different kinds of minerals we see on Earth would exist. Our new projections will inform planetary investigations, with probes tuned to detect mineralogical signs of life.\\"      Rhodochrosite is a carbonate mineral first described in 1813. Discovered in the silver mines of Romania, rhodochrosite is currently mined in Argentina to produce manganese for stainless steel manufacturing. Credit: Smithsonian Digital Studios      How many are out there?      Today, mineralogists recognize 406 carbon minerals out of more than 5000 known mineral species on Earth. Since 2010, the International Mineralogical Association has reported the discovery of an average of about four new carbon minerals every year for the past five years. However, DCO researchers now estimate there are at least 145 more carbon minerals still awaiting discovery.      The video will load shortly      Hazen and his colleagues, including mathematician Grethe Hystad of Purdue University Calumet, used a type of analysis called Large Number of Rare Events (LNRE) modeling to formulate this prediction, and will share the work in American Mineralogist in early 2016 (a preprint is available here) as well as during the Friday morning poster session at the 2015 AGU Fall Meeting (V51C-3039) and -3040.      \\"Imagine reading a book,\\" says DCO's Hazen. \\"Some words you read over and over throughout, such as 'and' and 'the.' These common words are everywhere and easy to spot. On the other hand, there are words that may appear only one or two times in an entire book. Earth's missing minerals are like these rare words; we haven't found them yet because they formed only in very few places and in very small quantities.\\"      The LNRE model also predicts that the majority of the carbon-bearing minerals awaiting discovery are hydrous carbonates, a potentially challenging fact for collectors.      Where are these undiscovered minerals and what do they look like?      Hazen's team predicts finding missing carbon minerals will challenge even the most dedicated mineral collectors. To have remained hidden for so long, these minerals must reside in remote localities and in small quantities. In some cases the minerals are likely ephemeral in nature. Many of the carbon species on Hazen's list, including hydrous carbonates, are potentially colorless, poorly crystalized, or easily dissolved in water.      While Hazen and colleagues have not identified a treasure map for finding the missing carbon minerals, there are some potentially rewarding localities to consider. These include the Poudrette Quarry in Canada, Kukisvumchorr Mountain in Russia, and Clara Mine in Germany, where collectors have already found a diverse array of carbon minerals.      \\"There's something magical about mineral collecting that's hard to put into words,\\" said Hazen's colleague and DCO early career scientist Daniel Hummer. \\"You're collecting fundamental constituents of the natural world that only exist because life has interacted with rocks over millions, or even billions, of years.\\"      \\"One of the most exciting prospects,\\" Hummer continues, \\"is we might even stumble upon minerals we didn't predict in our analyses. We could be in for a surprise!\\"      Used the world over in pencils, graphite is a mineral of pure carbon. The United States Geological Survey estimates over a million tons of graphite are currently mined every year around the world. Credit: Smithsonian Digital Studios      In fact, some of the missing carbon minerals might be hiding in plain sight, sitting in a museum drawer.      \\"As a PhD student at the University of Arizona, I work on the development of the RRUFF mineral database in (co-author) Professor Robert Downs' lab,\\" said Barbara Lafuente. \\"It's quite possible we'll find one or two new carbon minerals in our university's mineral collection, now that we know what we're looking for.\\"      How does the Carbon Mineral Challenge work?      Amateur and professional mineral collectors should follow the procedures outlined by the International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification. Once the commission has approved the new mineral, the team responsible for its discovery and verification should submit their entry to the Carbon Mineral Challenge via mineralchallenge.net.      Interested collectors may contact Carbon Mineral Challenge International Advisory Board members in their region with questions about mineral analysis and verification. Mineralchallenge.net also contains comprehensive guidelines, useful links, a photo gallery of known carbon minerals, and a list of FAQs for potential participants.      The Carbon Mineral Challenge will continue until September 2019. DCO will publicly recognize each discovery as it happens and celebrate the final suite of newly discovered carbon minerals at the culmination of its decadal program in late 2019.      The Carbon Mineral Challenge shines a light on a very specific, but important, subset of minerals.

According to a new predictive model, more than 140 carbon mineral species on Earth have yet to be discovered, and DCO scientists have launched a citizen science project called the Carbon Mineral Challenge to find them.      Over the next four years, teams around the world will study samples of carbon minerals submitted not only by academic mineralogists, but by amateur collectors and explorers. Got some unusual-looking minerals you’ve collected and stored in your garage? Head to the Carbon Mineral Challenge’s website to see whether they might be worth scrutinizing, says Robert Hazen at the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory and executive director of DCO.      As an institution devoted to exploring carbon’s role on a planetary scale, DCO has a particular interest in carbon minerals. Carbon plays a role in all of Earth’s biology and in fundamental processes from the atmosphere to Earth’s core. The discovery of new carbon mineral species could also add immeasurably to research on materials, energy, and climate. “The chemistry of carbon tells us a lot about the chemistry of Earth,” Hazen says.      Most of the mineral species we know of have been found serendipitously—a large number of those by amateur mineralogists.      Hazen and his colleagues recently developed a method that combines the distributions and locations of known minerals with statistical methods used in biology and lexicography to predict the number of unknown carbon minerals on Earth. Scientists have catalogued 5,027 mineral species, of which 406 contain carbon. The new analysis, currently in press in American Mineralogist, predicts that there are still about 145 carbon mineral species left for the finding.      Hazen and his colleagues announced the program, which is partly funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, on Dec. 17 at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.      International teams of mineralogists are ready to vet promising candidates, determining compositions with electron microprobe analysis and crystal structures via X-ray crystallography.      “It will be fascinating to see what new and exciting carbon minerals might be lurking in our Smithsonian collection drawers,” says Jeffrey E. Post, chair of the mineral sciences department and curator of the National Gem & Mineral Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. “And what impact they might have on understanding our planet.”      This article is reproduced with permission from Chemical & Engineering News (© American Chemical Society).

Please answer the following question: Article: One is never too old to learn. Life learning (sometimes called un-schooling or self-directed learning) is one of those concepts that are almost easier to explain by saying what it isn't than what it is. And that's probably because our own schooled backgrounds have convinced us that learning happens only in a fine building on certain days, between certain hours, and managed by a specially trained professional. Within that schooling framestudy, no matter how hard teachers try and no matter how good their textbooks, many bright students get bored, many slower students struggle and give up or lose their self-respect, and most of them reach the end of the process unprepared to enter into society. They have memorized a certain body of knowledge long enough to rush back the information on tests, but they haven't really learnt much, at least of the official curriculum. Life learners, on the other hand, know that learning is not difficult, that people learn things quite easily if they're not compelled and forced, if they see a need to learn something, and if they are trusted and respected enough to learn it on their own timetable, at their own speed, in their own way--no matter what age and no matter whether we're at school or at home. Life learning is independent of time, location or the presence of teacher. It does not require mom or dad to teach, or kids to work in workbooks at the table from 9 to noon. Life learning is learner-driven. It involves living and learning--in and from the real world. It is about exploring, questioning, experimenting, making messes, taking risks without fear of making mistakes, being laughed at and trying again. Furthermore, life learning is about trusting kids to learn what they need to know and about helping them to learn and grow in their own ways. It is about providing positive experiences that enable children to understand the world and their culture and to interact with it. Question: Through life learning, children   _  .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the last names of the two people who agreed to a joint command? ?  Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks.  He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack.  Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29. If you execute your enemies, it saves you the trouble of having to forgive them. The answer to this question is:","output":"The last names of the two people who agreed to a joint command are Neill and Bowie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Where might  jellyfish stay warm? - atlantic ocean - bikini bottom - japanese restaurant - store - pacific ocean  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is the Pacific Ocean. Jellyfish are marine animals that can be found in every ocean, but they often prefer warmer ocean waters. The Pacific Ocean, particularly in areas with warm water currents, provides a suitable environment for jellyfish to thrive, reproduce, and maintain their body temperature. Although jellyfish can also be found in the Atlantic Ocean, the other options mentioned - Bikini Bottom (a fictional location in the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants), a Japanese restaurant, and a store - are not natural habitats for jellyfish to stay warm. Additionally, Japanese restaurants and stores are unlikely to provide appropriate living conditions that meet the requirements of these creatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Great Ziegfeld Movie plot: Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. was born to an upper-middle class family in the late 19th century. From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines. Anna Held became household synonyms for what's beautiful and fashionable, Flo's accountant stopped seeing red in the books.By 1907, Flo and Anna had been married for some time and Flo found it boring to feature only one girl in a show. He wanted to produce a show featuring girls, lots of girls; and the stage would be so big that even the audience in the last row would be able to see the performance. Flo sold the idea to Billings, Billings sold it to famous producer Erlanger; and so began 24 years of the Zigfeld Follies.Flo's... My question: Where did Flo die?

I'm positive about what I saw.\\" My mom looked at me skeptically, raising an eyebrow. \\"Alright then, enlighten me. What exactly did you see?\\" I took a deep breath, recalling the image of the creature in my mind. \\"It had a massive wingspan, and it moved so gracefully. The wings had a stark, almost shimmering quality to them, not like just any bird. Its body was covered in some kind of fur or thick hair, which made the creature appear almost ethereal. The colors on its body seemed to blend seamlessly into the surroundings, making it difficult to see clearly. And its eyes... there was just something about them. They seemed intelligent, almost as if it was studying me as much as I was studying it.\\" My mom's skepticism began to wane as she started to listen intently to the details of my description. \\"That does sound... unusual. And you're sure it wasn't just a trick of the light, or your imagination playing tricks on you?\\" I nodded, conviction in my voice. \\"I'm certain, mom. I've never seen anything like it before. It was definitely not just a bird.\\" As we stood there, contemplating the strange creature I had encountered, we both felt a sense of wonder and uncertainty. Despite my mom's skepticism, the detailed description and my unwavering conviction had left an impression on her. \\"Perhaps it was a cryptid, a creature not yet identified by science,\\" I suggested. \\"Or maybe it was an animal that used to be considered extinct, like the Coelacanth. It could have been living in the dense forest, hidden away from human eyes for who knows how long.\\" The possibility sent shivers down our spines, as we pondered the implications of such a discovery. We were torn between wanting to investigate further and the fear of what we might find if we dared to venture deeper into the forest in search of the creature. Finally, my mom hesitantly agreed that, regardless of what the creature was, it was worth attempting to further investigate and document its existence. We decided to make a plan and gather necessary equipment like cameras, binoculars, and camouflaged clothing to maximize our chances of coming across the creature again. Over the next several weeks, we dedicated our free time to searching for any sign of the mysterious creature. We spoke to locals to see if any of them had had a similar encounter, and much to our surprise, some people had indeed seen or heard of strange sightings in the area. This only bolstered our resolve to find concrete evidence of the enigmatic creature. During one of our expeditions deep into the forest, we stumbled upon a patch of terrain that seemed out of the ordinary. The ground appeared to be covered in some sort of track, and though it was difficult to discern a specific shape, the sheer size of the indentations was enough to give us a strong suspicion that our creature had passed through the area. Over time, our backyard adventures began to turn into serious and systematic research projects. We studied the local flora and fauna, and documented any unusual or unexplained phenomena. We reached out to experts in the fields of zoology, biology, and cryptozoology, who took a keen interest in our findings and offered valuable input and guidance. As the weeks turned into months, our hunt for the elusive creature continued. Though we hadn't encountered the creature again, our determination only grew stronger. We knew that the answers - and perhaps a new, groundbreaking discovery - lay just beyond our grasp. And we were willing to do whatever it took to unveil the truth hidden among the trees. In the end, our relentless search led us to the realm of cryptozoology and the exciting world of undiscovered species and hidden natural secrets. Regardless of what the creature was - be it a cryptid, an extinct species, or even just a bird - the journey of discovery sparked a passion for exploration and a newfound appreciation for the wonders of the world around us. And that, in itself, was a treasure worth seeking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information:  - Belarus ( lat.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.

The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

It could be about any matter that requires a numerical or measurable answer, for instance, the cost of an item, the quantity of goods, the amount of time spent on an activity, and so on. Contrarily, the hypothesis \\"Do you want to give any information?\\" is a more general question that might encompass any form of data or details, regardless of type or topic. This question does not restrict the response to a numerical or measurable one. It could be qualitative or descriptive information, opinions, facts, or any other form of knowledge. So, while both questions are indeed seeking information, they are not interchangeable due to their specificity or general nature. It is impossible to accurately determine if the hypothesis \\"Do you want to give any information?\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"Do you want to say how much?\\" because they do not inquire about the same type of information.

The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 13:01 EST, 16 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:14 EST, 16 July 2013. A reporter who had an affair with Dateline NBC star Chris Hansen has spoken out about what she says is a double standard against women in broadcast media. The outburst comes as 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell released photographs allegedly showing her kissing Hansen, who had previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies'. Miss Caddell claims that she has not been able to find work since their four-month affair was revealed, while Hansen has continued unscathed by the scandal, according to RadarOnline. Caught on camera: Kristyn Caddell says this photo, allegedly showing Chris Hansen and her kissing, proves their relationship. The reporter said she had worked at three stations since the affair was revealed in 2011, but claims she was unable to hold down a job because of the stigma of the relationship. 'No matter what your philosophy is. on someone who has an affair, if it was the man or the woman’s fault,. there are two people involved and if I can’t work, he should not be able. to work,' Miss Caddell told RadarOnline. 'I have lived the double standard,' she. added. 'A double standard is an understatement as to what happens in. this industry. The women get fired and the men keep going.' Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV. She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date. 'I believed him with my heart,' Miss Caddell, who is not married and does not have children, said. 'You can say I was naive, as it was. That was my biggest crime, being naive ... I make one personal mistake and I am [considered] a worthless human being.' Ruined: Kristyn Caddell claims she has been turned down by news networks because of the affair. Denial: When the National Enquirer first revealed the affair, Chris Hansen said the pair were just friends. Hansen, a father who is best known for his show To Catch a Predator, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner. 'I understand the perceived irony of. the, you know, so-called \\"gotcha guy\\" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the \\"gotcha guy\\" got gotcha-ed. doing was going out to dinner.' The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment. However, in images Miss Caddell has just released, Hansen is shown kissing her. She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it. 'Chris was flying me all over the. country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling. with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in. public places ... Chris. gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I. trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month. Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her. 'For the past two. years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say. anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep. trying to get jobs. “But we. are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an. employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation. involving Chris Hansen.' She added: “I. thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in. my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and. my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of. that.' Dreams shattered: Kristyn Caddell says the scandal has ruined her career as a news reporter. The reporter added that she had struggled to break into journalism, and just before the affair, had finally felt like her career was taking off. 'Then, to essentially get taken down, because of a man, who has a lot of money and a lot of fame, it is not a good feeling. That is what happened to me,' she said. Hansen has previously claimed the pair were no more than friends, according to Fox News. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a reporter named Kristyn Caddell who had an affair with a famous TV personality, Chris Hansen.

The article includes a photo of Caddell and Hansen allegedly kissing, which she released to prove their relationship. Caddell believes that the situation is unfair and that both of them should be treated the same way, regardless of whether they were at fault in the affair.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Answer:","output":"The text does not provide specific information on the duration of the alleged affair between President Trump and the adult film star. The claim made by the adult film star was that she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but it does not detail whether this was a one-time event or a longer-lasting relationship. Consequently, any conclusion about the duration of the affair would be speculative based on the information provided in the text. As mentioned in the text, President Trump has denied that the tryst ever occurred."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel.

The word \\"tragedy\\" implies that the situation being discussed or referred to is deeply unfortunate, unhappy, or disastrous in nature. This further suggests that the speaker is expressing their emotions or thoughts about an event or occurrence that has caused them or others distress, pain, or suffering. Various factors, including context, tone, and facial expressions of the speaker, can influence the sentiment's intensity and the nuances of the emotion that it conveys. For example, a more solemn tone could cause the sentiment to be perceived as stronger and more profound, revealing a deep sense of sadness and grief. In contrast, a lighter tone could make the sentiment seem less severe, implying a more moderate level of disappointment or sorrow. Additionally, the context in which the sentence is used can shape how the sentiment is understood. If the sentence is spoken or written in response to something like the recent death of a loved one, the sentiment will likely be perceived as profoundly sad and compassionate. On the other hand, if the sentence is used to describe a less severe event, such as a canceled trip or a lost item, the sentiment may carry a slightly different emotional weight, leaning towards disappointment and inconvenience. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"such a tragedy\\" is generally perceived as negative, reflecting emotions such as sadness, empathy, and disappointment. The intensity and specific nuances of the sentiment can vary based on factors like tone, context, and the speaker's expressions, highlighting the importance of considering these aspects when interpreting and responding to the statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context:  The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret.

Analyze the sentence structure and meaning: The sentence states a person's preference to not become a wife first, and then have to worry about fitting in other things in their life.  2. Break down the sentence into smaller phrases: I don't want = Nechci (in Czech, negation is used as a separate word) to be = být a wife = manželka first = nejdříve and then = a pak have to worry = muset se starat (the infinitive \\"muset\\" means \\"have to\\", \\"se\\" is a reflexive pronoun, and \\"starat\\" means \\"worry\\") about = o when I'm gonna fit in = kdy se mi to podaří zařadit (using the colloquial expression \\"gonna\\" which means \\"going to\\", and translating it to the corresponding future tense in Czech) the other stuff = ostatní věci 3.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The reason is that the premise and the hypothesis are not logically connected. Thus, the truth of the premise has no bearing on the validity of the hypothesis. The premise states that every time the person runs their VCR while they are at work, they record a particular talk show and watch it every evening when they come home. The focus of the premise is about the person's tendency to watch a specific talk show and does not touch on their presence or absence at home in the evenings. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the person does not come home in the evenings. This assertion does not have any relation to the premise. Since the premise focuses solely on watching the talk show in the evening, it leaves open the possibility that there are other evenings when the person does not watch the talk show or indeed doesn't come home. Nevertheless, there is no logical connection that can be established between the premise and the hypothesis, so the truth of the premise cannot confirm the validity of the hypothesis. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, more information is needed about the person's daily routine, work schedule, and habits. Simply knowing that they watch a talk show in the evening upon returning home does not provide an adequate basis for inferring whether they come home or not every evening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aerosmith‘s Steven Tyler has again sent President Trump a cease-and-desist letter for using the band’s music without permission at a political rally.      In 2015, the singer’s legal team warned the then-Republican presidential candidate over his use of “Dream On” on the campaign trail. Three years later, a Trump rally Tuesday at West Virginia’s Charleston Civic Center featured Aerosmith’s 1993 hit “Livin’ on the Edge,” resulting in another cease-and-desist letter from Tyler, Variety reports.      “By using ‘Livin’ On The Edge’ without our client’s permission, Mr. Trump is falsely implying that our client, once again, endorses his campaign and/or his presidency, as evidenced by actual confusion seen from the reactions of our client’s fans all over social media,” the cease-and-desist letter stated.      “This specifically violates Section 43 of the Lanham Act, as it ‘is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person.'”      The letter also notes that Trump’s team has ignored the previous cease-and-desist from 2015, making this latest violation a “willful infringement. “What makes this violation even more egregious is that Mr. Trump’s use of our client’s music was previously shut down, not once, but two times, during his campaign for presidency in 2015,” the letter continued.

Like in 2015, it is Tyler – and not Aerosmith – taking legal action against Trump: Both Perry and drummer Joey Kramer are avowed Republicans, with Kramer especially vocal about his support from Trump.      On Monday, the night before the West Virginia rally, Aerosmith performed alongside Post Malone at the MTV Video Music Awards. The band will begin a Las Vegas residency in April 2019. ||||| Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler is demanding President Donald Trump stop using the band’s songs at rallies, like the one held at the Charleston Civic Center in West Virginia on Tuesday (August 21). The band’s 1993 hit “Livin’ on the Edge” was played as Trump devotees entered the venue, which has a capacity of 13,500. Tyler has in turn sent a “cease and desist” letter through his attorney Dina LaPolt to the White House accusing the President of willful infringement in broadcasting the song, which was written by Tyler, Joe Perry and Mark Hudson.      Citing the Lanham Act, which prohibits “any false designation or misleading description or representation of fact … likely to cause confusion … as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person,” Tyler’s attorney contends that playing an Aerosmith song in a public arena gives the false impression that Tyler is endorsing Trump’s presidency.      The matter has come up previously with another Aerosmith song, “Dream On,” which Trump used during his 2015 election campaign. Following a similar letter stating, “Trump for President needs our client’s express written permission in order to use his music” and that the campaign “was violating Mr. Tyler’s copyright,” BMI drove the point home and pulled the public performance rights for the song. Public performance rights for “Livin’ on the Edge” are administered by ASCAP.      The scene in WV before Trump’s rally. Aerosmith’s “Livin’ on the edge” playing. pic.twitter.com/HW1qr9TBgE — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 21, 2018      During the rally, President Trump spoke about immigration, trade and politics, peppered with his usual banter about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.      Earlier in the day, Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts in federal court on Tuesday, including campaign finance violations related to payments made to women who claim to have had affairs with Trump.      Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was also found guilty Tuesday on eight of 18 counts in his federal trial over fraud charges. The case involved work Manafort did on behalf of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. Shortly after the verdicts were announced, President Trump told reporters: “I feel badly for Paul Manafort” and called him “a good man.”      On Sunday, Aerosmith was among the top-billed acts on the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, joining Post Malone and 21 Savage for the show’s closing performance, a medley of “Dream On” and “Toys in the Attic.”      Read portions of Tyler’s letter to the White House below:      It has come to our attention that President Donald J. Trump and/or The Trump Organization (collectively, “Mr. Trump”) have been using our client’s song “Livin’ On The Edge” in connection with political rally events (the Rallies”), including at an event held yesterday at the Charleston Civic Center in Charleston, West Virginia on August 21, 2018. As expressly outlined in the Previous Letters, Mr. Trump does not have our client’s permission to use any of our client’s music, including “Livin’ On The Edge”.      What makes this violation even more egregious is that Mr. Trump’s use of our client’s music was previously shut down, not once, but two times, during his campaign for presidency in 2015. Please see the Previous Letters sent on behalf of our client attached here as Exhibit A. Due to your receipt of the Previous Letters, such conduct is clearly willful, subjecting Mr. Trump to the maximum penalty under the law.      As we have made clear numerous times, Mr. Trump is creating the false impression that our client has given his consent for the use of his music, and even that he endorses the presidency of Mr. Trump. By using “Livin’ On The Edge” without our client’s permission, Mr. Trump is falsely implying that our client, once again, endorses his campaign and/or his presidency, as evidenced by actual confusion seen from the reactions of our client’s fans all over social media. This specifically violates Section 43 of the Lanham Act, as it “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person.”      Further, as we have also made clear, Mr. Trump needs our client’s express written permission in order to use his music. We demanded Mr. Tyler’s public performance societies terminate their licenses with you in 2015 in connection with “Dream On” and any other musical compositions written or co-written by Mr. Tyler. As such, we are unaware of any remaining public performance license still in existence which grants Mr. Trump the right use his music in connection with the Rallies or any other purpose. If Mr. Trump has any such license, please forward it to our attention immediately.      In addition, Mr. Tyler’s voice is easily recognizable and central to his identity, and any use thereof wrongfully misappropriates his rights of publicity. Mr. Trump does not have any right to use the name, image, voice or likeness of our client, without his express written permission.

Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Bishop Andrew de Moravia"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The girl sounded worse when she sang slow songs than fast ones. Her voice went worse with","output":"each passing note, making her frustration increasingly palpable. It was no secret that she had a penchant for energetic tunes, but her lack of finesse when it came to slower melodies was proving to be an obstacle in her journey as a budding singer. The dreamy, mellifluous cadence of slow songs had always eluded her, resulting in a warbling, uneven sound. Each attempt seemed to fray her nerves, leaving her crestfallen. There was a stark contrast between her animated, exuberant renditions of fast songs, filled with soaring high notes and smoldering passion, and her listless, unstable performances of slow ballads. Puzzled and disheartened, the girl reached out to a vocal coach for guidance. Coach Elina, a seasoned singer known for her versatility and nuanced understanding of diverse musical genres, agreed to take the girl under her wing. During their initial session together, Elina probed the girl's technique and assessed her vocal abilities. With a discerning ear, she identified the root cause of the girl's plight: breath control. The girl's rapid, shallow breathing was incompatible with the demands of slow songs, resulting in a shaky and wavering voice. In contrast, her breathing was perfectly suited for the upbeat pace of fast songs. To remedy the issue, Elina explained the importance of proper breath support and taught the girl breathing techniques honed through decades of vocal instruction. They began with diaphragmatic breathing exercises, followed by elongated exhales and breath management techniques. Each lesson focused on refining the girl's breathing abilities, regulating her airflow, and incorporating this into her singing. Slowly but surely, the girl's slow song performances began to transform. Under Elina's watchful eye, she learned to harness the power of her breath – her once-tremulous voice gained stability, added richness, and bloomed with nuanced emotion. Over weeks and months of relentless practice, the girl achieved progress that she had once deemed unattainable. But Elina knew that a well-rounded singer needed more than skillful breath control. Sensing the girl's sensitivity towards emotions, she coached her on the art of storytelling through music. Songs were no longer just melodious words; they became a means of conveying the deepest human emotions. The girl gradually learned to tap into her raw vulnerability, to breathe life into the lyrics and bring the story to the forefront. As the girl's capacity to captivate her audience burgeoned, so did her confidence. Her newfound control over her breathing and an innate ability to convey the songs' sentiments carved a unique signature style—toe-curlingly beautiful and emotionally evocative. The experts marveled at her metamorphosis, while the listeners reveled in the emotive power of her voice. In time, the girl became known for her soul-stirring renditions of slow songs as much as her effervescent performances of fast ones. Her dedication, persistence, and openness to learning had allowed her to overcome a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, forging her into a versatile artist capable of effortlessly capturing the hearts of her audience.  And so, the girl who once sounded worse when she sang slow songs than fast ones had blossomed into a singer with a voice that captured the essence of both joy and sorrow with equal skill. Her journey serves as a testament to the transformative power of dedication, passion, and mentorship, and her story continues to inspire those who seek mastery over their art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Which of the following was not characteristic of music of the Romantic era: an extended melodic line, emotional elements, or Classical era forms? Context: The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Jack Elgin (Jeremy Irons) is the European editor of The Economist, a magazine based in London, England. Jack has a wife, Maria (Briony Glassco), and three kids, Joanne (Anna Maguire), Julia (Holly Boyd), and Andrew (Joel Pitts). Jack subtly hijacks the family vacation, changing it from a lazy week of Mediterranean fun and sun in Corfu, Greece, to a tour of India, because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed as the kids are.Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously seize a plum reporting assignment and spend at least a smidgen of quality time with his family. But, on the way to India, their plane, a Boeing 747-200 owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in Limassol, Cyprus, because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the planeâwhich is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a Serbian man named Ivanic Loyvek (Serge Soric) and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic (Ivan Marevich). And they are demanding 50,000,000 from the U.S. State Department in one hour or everyone on the airplane will die.The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last. But as soon as a front passenger door is opened, a local police team gunning for the terrorists opens fire. The flight attendants frantically open the rest of the airplane's doors and start getting passengers out, but the terrorists start killing passengers, leading to an explosion.Maria, Joanne, and Julia get out of the airplane, and then Jack, holding Andrew, gets outâonly to watch Maria, Joanne, and Julia get shot by the terrorists. Jack tries to hide Andrew's face so he can't see it. Maria and Joanne are dead, and Julia is still aliveâbut Julia burns to death while crying for help. In all, a total of 15 passengers die, and Loyvek and Maldic, the surviving terrorists, escape, knowing that they now have the 50,000,000. Jack feels that the hijacking would never have ended that way if the police team had waited until after the passengers were released from the airplane before getting trigger happy.Back in London, an absolutely devastated Jack is told that the terrorists were captured, but they were released and deported secretly, with no charges, no arrestâthe result of some awfully compromised politics. Jack is understandably enraged that Loyvek and Maldic got off scot-free. While helping Andrew cope, Jack tries all the legal ways to ensure justice for his family, but to no avail.Jack pays a visit to Henry Davidson (Jason Priestley), a CIA agent who works at the American Embassy in London. Davidson tells Jack that there's little that can be done. Obviously, the American and British governments are completely impotent when it comes to going after Loyvek and Maldic, so Jack must do it himself.With the help of his friend ex-intelligence operative Kate Stockton (Charlotte Rampling), who is well-schooled in the finer points of international intelligence, Jack becomes a one-man anti-terrorist squadron, tracking down those who work with Loyvek and Maldic, and turning their own weapons against them. Dogging Jack's trail is FBI agent Jules Bernard (Forest Whitaker), who's cooperating with Scotland Yard on anti-terrorist activities, and who suspects that Jack is the man who has been killing anyone involved in the hijacking.But as it turns out, Jules is on Jack's side, and he's willing to help Jack. After Jack kills Maldic, it turns out that Davidson was behind everything. Davidson had the airplane hijacked so he could get 50,000,000. With Jules's help, Jack sets out to make Loyvek and Davidson pay for the deaths of his family and the other people who died in Cyprus. Student:","output":"1.

Article: Some of the most painful moments I spend as a vet ( ) are those spent with my customers assisting my animal patients from this world to the next. Making this final decision is not easy, and I have often felt powerless to comfort the sorrowful owners. That was before I met Shane. I had been called to examine a ten-year-old dog named Belker who had developed a serious health problem. The dog's owner--Ron, his wife, Lisa, and their little boy, Shane--were hoping for a miracle  . But I told the family there were no miracles left for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia   for the old dog in their home. As we made the arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for the four-year-old Shane to observe the euthanasia. They felt Shane could learn something from the experience. The next day, _  Shane seemed so calm, patting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. A few minutes later, Belker slipped peacefully away. The little boy seemed to accept Belker's death without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a little while after Belker's death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives. Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up: \\"I know why.\\" Shocked, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next astonished me. I'd never heard a more comforting explanation. He said, \\"Everybody is born so they can learn how to live a good life: like loving everybody and being nice, right?\\" The four-year-old continued, \\"Well, animals already know how to do that, so they don't have to stay as long.\\" Question: What would the author say about Shane?

Write highlights for this article: George W. Bush appeared to take aim at his successor President Obama in an interview aired today - as he suggested the draw down of troops in Iraq had allowed ISIS to flourish. Speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview, the 68-year-old former president said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' Scroll down for video. Former president: George W. Bush (pictured speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview that will air on Sunday) has only one regret about invading Iraq - that it paved the way for the rise of the Islamic State. Militant: Bush told correspondent Bob Schieffer: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is \\"Al-Qaeda plus\\"…they need to be defeated.' Above, an ISIS militant in Raqqa, Syria. During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer,  Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein did not take him seriously. 'You know, when he was captured... I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him, he said \\"I just didn’t believe Bush,\\"' he said. 'And it’s hard for me to believe he didn’t believe me.' 'In retrospect…I don’t see how he could doubt my word,' Bush, who is currently promoting his new book, '41: A Portrait Of My Father', which is a biography of his father, George H.W. Bush, added. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, which spanned March 19 to May 1 that year, signaled the start of the Iraq War, which claimed the lives of nearly half a million people. Discussing the war: During the interview, the 68-year-old former president (pictured, right, with Schieffer), said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. After the invasion: Bush is pictured addressing the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. He declared major fighting over in Iraq, calling it 'one victory in a war on terror' Former Iraqi president: During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer, Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein (pictured) did not take him seriously. In December 2011, under the orders of President Barack Obama, all U.S. troops departed from Iraq, bringing the American mission in the war-torn country to an end. However, in the past few years, ISIS has quickly risen to power in  Iraq and Syria, taking control of swathes of both countries. In June, the terror group overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Bush's two-part interview will air on CBS News's Sunday Morning at 9am on Sunday, as well as the channel's 'Face The Nation' at 10.30am the same day. 'Critically injured': On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) In the biography, Bush also reveals his father, now 90, seriously considered not running for re-election in 1992, even though he loved his job. This is because he felt his role was creating scrutiny of his son, Neil Bush, who was facing a federal lawsuit. 'It killed him to see Neil singled out because he was the President's son,' Bush wrote. The book also discusses George H.W. Bush's decision to launch the first war in Iraq in 1991, his early failures in politics and his stinging defeat to Bill Clinton  in 1992.

Martín de Ursúa used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of Governor-General of the Philippines, which he took up in 1709. European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called \\"wild\\" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts.

Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.

It follows an announcement that there will be an inquiry into several deaths of children over recent years. The hospital has welcomed the review and hopes it will restore confidence. A spokesman maintained the unit was safe but added it will be co-operating with the independent review by Sir Ian Kennedy who led the Bristol Royal Infirmary investigation. It has been prompted following concerns by parents about the care given to their children. Harley's parents, Danielle Gatehouse and Lee Pascoe, said his operation was cancelled five times because there was no intensive care bed available at the hospital. By the time he was given surgery his condition had deteriorated. \\"No-one ever told us it was urgent when we were at the hospital,\\" Ms Gatehouse said. \\"He had an echo a day before they did his operation and they noticed a duct in his heart was closing up. \\"They had to double the dose of his drugs to keep it open and that's when he became an emergency and was operated on the next day.\\" The hospital said Harley was not considered urgent at the time which was why children with more serious conditions had to be seen first. Stephen Snelson and his partner Vicky said they had not heard anything from the hospital about the Child Death Review for several months. \\"I don't know what I should be doing because no-one has explained to me what to do,\\" Ms Snelson said. \\"They promised they'd be here for us forever... we'll always be at the end of the phone...

Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time - and claims Celtic’s chances of reaching the League Cup Final are no more than 50/50. The Scottish champions moved three points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 victory over Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday, while Rangers, whose caretaker boss Kenny McDowall last week handed in his notice, remain mired in a boardroom crisis and trail Championship leaders Hearts by 13 points. Parkhead striker Anthony Stokes has admitted some fans won’t be satisfied unless Ronny Deila’s men rack up four or five goals against their beleaguered rivals at Hampden. Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time. But Celtic No 1 Gordon says talk of running up a cricket score is dangerous and misguided. He said: ‘We got by against Ross County with just one goal and that shows you can’t go into any game thinking about how many goals you’re going to score. ‘Is it a 50-50 game? They probably always are 50/50 games, regardless of who’s playing for the two sides. ‘Rangers still have enough quality in their team to win a game so we’ll be looking at ourselves and our preparation. Rangers manager Kenny McDowall, who has handed in his notice, during a training session. ‘The form book goes out the window in Celtic-Rangers matches. There are two sides with 11 men desperate to win the game. And when you have that, anything can happen. ‘You go out in any match intending to win your own individual battles and try to get a victory – whatever the scoreline.’ Former Sunderland and Hearts star Gordon knows the quality of the Rangers squad having spent time training at Murray Park during his long recovery from injury. The 32-year-old was involved in a public spat last November when ex-Rangers boss Ally McCoist claimed he had tried to sign him – a claim the keeper rejected. Celtic's Kris Commons celebrates his goal with team-mates during Saturday's win against Ross County. He also rejects the notion Celtic will be under enormous pressure on Sunday, given they are clear favourites. ‘I don’t feel there is added pressure on us. It’s not just experience Rangers have, but good, quality players, too. So we’ll have to be wary of that, as well as causing our own problems for them. ‘It’s a semi-final and it’s a massive match - but it would be massive regardless.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates going three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premier League. Meanwhile, Celtic boss Deila remained coy when asked about a link with Manchester United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher on Saturday. He said: ‘There’s nothing new in that matter. He has several [interested clubs] and it is best for me to wait to next Monday to see where we are.’ Celtic also been linked with a move for midfielder Kim Bo-Kyung. They missed out on the South Korea international when Malky Mackay brought him to Cardiff for £5million in 2012 but he has just been released by the Welsh side.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"These two questions do carry a similar meaning, with both emphasizing the hypothetical scenario in which Muslims never existed. However, the first question is more direct, while the second one is framed to ask about the consequences or implications of Muslims never having existed. To answer the question on this hypothetical scenario, we will take a look at various aspects of history, society, culture, and science that have been influenced by Muslims or the Islamic civilization. 1. Historical Impact One of the most significant Muslim contributions to history is the Islamic Golden Age, which lasted from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Many significant advances in science, philosophy, and art occurred during this time, which originated in the Middle East and later influenced other parts of the world. Without Muslims, the Islamic Golden Age would not have happened, which could have led to a delay or even discontinuity in the development of mathematics, natural sciences, philosophy, and literature. Moreover, the Islamic Empire would not have been established. This empire was one of the largest in history, stretching from Spain to northern India and Central Asia. Without the Muslim influence in these areas, the political landscape would have been very different in key historical periods, such as during the Crusades and the age of exploration. 2. Society and Culture Muslim culture and Islamic values greatly influenced art, poetry, music, and architecture. Many iconic buildings, such as the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, and the Great Mosque of Cordoba, would not have been constructed. The intricate Islamic geometric designs found in many art forms would also not exist without the Muslim influence. In addition to physical contributions, the Islamic world also made significant contributions to literature. Classic works like One Thousand and One Nights would not have been written or preserved. The world would also be devoid of renowned Muslim poets like Rumi and Hafez, whose works continue to inspire people across the globe. 3. Scientific and Technological Contributions The Islamic Golden Age saw major advancements in scientific fields, such as medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry. Without Muslims, great scholars like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), and Al-Khwarizmi, who developed the concept of algorithms in mathematics, might not have made such significant contributions. Pioneering medical texts, such as the Canon of Medicine by Avicenna, significantly impacted the study and practice of medicine globally. Similarly, the fields of optics, astronomy, and mechanical engineering benefited from the contributions of Muslim scholars like al-Haytham, al-Biruni, and Al-Jazari. 4. Religious Influence If Muslims did not exist, the religion of Islam would not have spread across the world. Today, Islam is the second-largest religion globally, with around 1.8 billion followers. Moreover, the world would not have experienced the encounter, dialogue, and exchange of ideas between Islam and other major world religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism, which helped shape the history of interreligious understanding and conflicts. In conclusion, if Muslims had never existed, the world would have been a very different place. From historical events to cultural, scientific, and technological advancements, the absence of Muslims would have dramatically altered the course of human history. While it is impossible to predict precisely the alternative outcomes that would have arisen without Muslim existence, it is clear that their contributions have had a significant and lasting impact on global society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years were between the Iroquois attacking the Neutral Nation, and having completely driven the trade from tradiitonal territory?","output":"Title: The Iroquois-Neutral Nation Conflict: Years of Struggle and Transformation in Trading Territory Introduction The Iroquois Confederacy, a powerful and influential Indigenous group consisting of five tribes (Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca), played a significant role in the history of North America, particularly in the region that is now the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Among their many conflicts with neighboring Indigenous nations, the Iroquois conducted a series of brutal attacks against the Neutral Nation, culminating in the complete dissolution of the Neutral confederacy. This article delves into the timeline of events and analyzes the critical factors that led to this Iroquois victory and the shifting of trade from traditional Neutral territories. Timeline of Conflict The early 17th century was marked by the escalation of tension and violence among Indigenous nations in the Northeast. As European fur traders became increasingly involved in the region, trade networks shifted, and local nations often found themselves compelled to take sides in conflicts to protect their interests. 1. Early Interactions (1600-1639) The Iroquois initially established contact with the Neutral Nation around 1600. During the early years, interactions were primarily peaceful, with elaborate ceremony and exchange of goods and wampum. However, by the 1630s, the Iroquois and their Huron allies experienced several violent confrontations with the Neutrals. This conflict was fueled by competition for control of the lucrative fur trade and the desire to strengthen alliances with European powers. 2. Escalation of Conflict (1640-1649) Between 1640 and 1649, tensions between the Iroquois and Neutral Nation intensified. The Iroquois, seeking to expand their influence over the fur trade, began launching attacks on Neutral territories. The Iroquois also continued attacks against the Huron and other Indigenous communities, with whom the Neutrals had relations. The hostile acts perpetrated by the Iroquois during this period culminated in the virtual destruction of the Huron confederacy in 1649. 3. The Final Decade (1650-1659) The complete annihilation of the Neutral Nation occurred during the 1650s. After defeating the Huron, the Iroquois turned their attention to the remaining communities connected to the fur trade: the Neutral Nation, the Petun, and the Erie. In the early 1650s, the Iroquois launched a series of devastating attacks on Neutral villages, leading to the migration of thousands of Neutral people from their traditional territories. By the mid-1650s, the Iroquois had largely driven the Neutral Nation from their lands and into a state of permanent displacement. Conclusion In conclusion, there were approximately three stages in the years-long conflict between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Neutral Nation. The process to drive the Neutral Nation from their traditional territory and alter the regional trade dynamic took roughly 50 to 60 years, from the initial introduction in 1600 to the final phase of the conflict in the 1650s. While the exact timeline of events may vary depending on different historical sources, it remains true that by the mid-17th century, the Iroquois had effectively subdued the Neutral Nation – and with the conquest of other regional powers like the Huron and Erie, they emerged as the dominant force in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Now, I have a new situation: A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture.  Answer this question please: Which village had a more dependable food supply? Answer:","output":"Village Beta had a more dependable food supply.  Step 1: Identify the time periods of both villages. Village Alpha is from 11,000 years ago, and Village Beta is from 9,000 years ago. Step 2: Consider the background information about the invention of agriculture. Agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago. Step 3: Determine the village with agricultural knowledge. According to the information about the archaeologists' study, the inhabitants of Village Beta already knew about and practiced agriculture. Step 4: Consider the relationship between agriculture and food supply. The background mentions that the invention of agriculture provided a bigger, more dependable food supply.

Q:Information:  - The Ediacaran Period, spans 94 million years from the end of the Cryogenian Period 635 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Cambrian Period 541 Mya. It marks the end of the Proterozoic Eon, and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. It is named after the Ediacara Hills of South Australia.  - The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.  - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Chitin (CHON) is a long-chain polymer of an \\"N\\"-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulae of molluscs, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses and on the scales and other soft tissues of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved versatile for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes.  - Perspicaris is a fossil arthropod from the Cambrian period . It was 2 -- 3 centimetres ( 0.8 -- 1.2 in ) long and bivalved . The valves , encasing the thorax , were joined together by a dorsal hinge . It is difficult to establish the lifestyle of Perspicaris . Its large eyes and other parts would suggest a swimming animal , yet it lacks claws , which seems to suggest a bottom feeder . Two species of Perspicaris are found in the famous Burgess Shale in British Columbia , Canada . 202 specimens of Perspicaris are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed , where they comprise 0.38 % of the community .  - The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress.  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. Within the thymus, T cells or T lymphocytes mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum, in front of the heart and behind the sternum. Histologically, each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T-cells. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin (derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells). Developing T-cells are referred to as thymocytes and are of hematopoietic origin. Stromal cells include epithelial cells of the thymic cortex and medulla, and dendritic cells.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - The thorax or chest (from the Greek  \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain.  - In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off a part of its body (often, but not always, an outer layer or covering), either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle.  - Anatomy is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts. Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - A Lagerstätte (from \\"Lager\\" 'storage, lair' \\"Stätte\\" 'place'; plural \\"Lagerstätten\\") is a sedimentary deposit that exhibits extraordinary fossils with exceptional preservationsometimes including preserved soft tissues. These formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an anoxic environment with minimal bacteria, thus delaying decomposition. \\"Lagerstätten\\" span geological time from the Neoproterozoic era to the present. Worldwide, some of the best examples of near-perfect fossilization are the Cambrian Maotianshan shales and Burgess Shale, the Devonian Hunsrück Slates and Gogo Formation, the Carboniferous Mazon Creek, the Jurassic Solnhofen limestone, and the Cretaceous Santana and Yixian formations.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - An exoskeleton (from Greek , \\"éx\\" \\"outer\\" and , \\"skeletos\\" \\"skeleton\\") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as \\"shells\\". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton.  - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.  - The neck is the part of the body, on many vertebrates, that separates the head from the torso or trunk. It contains blood vessels and nerves that supply structures in the head to the body. These in humans include part of the esophagus, the larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland, major blood vessels including the carotid arteries and jugular veins, and the first part of the spinal cord.  - A body plan (also written bodyplan), Bauplan (German plural Baupläne), or ground plan is \\"an assemblage of morphological features shared among many members of a phylum-level group\\". The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla.  - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who is responsible for choosing shows for the theatre?","output":"The responsibility for choosing shows for a theatre typically lies with a team comprising of various professionals, each contributing their unique expertise and perspective to the selection process. While the specific composition of this team may vary depending on a theatre's size, organizational structure, and goals, there are several common roles that play a significant part in this decision-making process: 1. Artistic Director: Often regarded as the most influential figure in the selection process, the artistic director sets the creative vision for a theatre season. They have to consider various factors such as a theatre’s audience preferences, mission, financial goals, and available resources. The artistic director is responsible for ensuring that the selected plays align with the theatre's identity, while also providing innovative and engaging content that can attract and retain patrons. 2. Executive Director / General Manager: In some theatres, the executive director or general manager also plays a significant role in choosing the repertoire. This role is typically responsible for the overall management and financial success of the organization. It involves ensuring that the selected shows can be produced within budget, meet revenue expectations, and align with the theatre's operational goals. They work closely with the artistic director to strike a balance between artistic integrity and fiscal responsibility. 3. Literary Manager / Dramaturg: These roles involve assessing and analyzing potential scripts, researching the context and themes of the proposed plays, and advising the artistic director on the artistic merits and potential challenges associated with each script. A literary manager may also be responsible for preselecting scripts based on the theatre's submission criteria and guidelines or establishing relationships with playwrights, agents, and publishers to access new and unpublished works. 4. Production Team: The production team may include key members such as the production manager, technical director, chief designer, and marketing manager. This team contributes their insights about the practicalities and feasibility of producing various shows, offering their perspectives on aspects like set design, lighting, costume requirements, and marketing strategies. Their input can influence the selection process by highlighting the resources and capabilities required for a particular production. 5. Board of Directors / Committee: The Board of Directors or a designated committee within the theatre organization may be involved in approving and endorsing the final season choices. This group is generally responsible for the theatre's strategic direction, fundraising, and sustainability and ensures that the proposed season aligns with the theatre's long-term goals and objectives. They often rely on recommendations from the artistic director, executive director, and production team to make informed decisions. 6. Audience / Community Input: The theatre audience and the local community may indirectly influence the selection process through surveys, feedback sessions, or focus groups that capture their interests and preferences. Such input can help guide a theatre in selecting shows that cater to their patrons' tastes as well as identify emerging trends and new opportunities to broaden their appeal. In summary, the responsibility for choosing shows for the theatre falls to a collaborative group of professionals, each playing a critical role in evaluating the artistic, financial, and logistical aspects of potential productions. The process combines creative vision with pragmatic considerations, aiming to deliver diverse and captivating experiences for audiences while maintaining the theatre's financial stability, artistic integrity, and strategic objectives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They took over the city during the Battle of France, which was a part of WW2 between the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany and the Allies, represented primarily by France, the United Kingdom, and their respective empires. Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. The German army launched its invasion of France on May 10, 1940, using a strategy known as the \\"Blitzkrieg\\" or \\"lightning war,\\" which relied on swift, coordinated attacks using tanks, infantry, and air support. Within a month, the Germans had advanced deep into French territory and encircled the main French and British forces in northern France and Belgium.

In February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama  Bin Laden and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al Zawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed a fatwa issued in the name of a \\"World Islamic Front.\\" A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a respected Islamic authority, but neither  Bin Laden, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were scholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV,  Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets.\\" Note: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety of names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: Nawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \\"al\\" that would be part of their name in their own societies. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \\"Bin\\" as part of a last name, as in  Bin Laden.

Summarize this article: BOSTON (Reuters) - The rising cost of higher education is dogging Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans, according to a federal report released on Wednesday.      While the Government Accountability Office report noted that relatively few U.S. households headed by people 65 or over are carrying student loans, the value of the unpaid debt had spiked from 2.8 billion in 2005, before the financial crisis.      That debt is concentrated in a small number of homes. Just 4 percent of households headed by someone 65 or older carried student loan debt as of 2010, up from 1 percent in 2004.      \\"Some may think of student loan debt as a just a young person's problem,\\" said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who heads a Senate committee on aging and held a hearing on the findings on Wednesday. \\"As it turns out, that's increasingly not the case.\\"      The 18.2 billion figure includes loans related to both the holders' education, often for those who have returned to school later in life, and their children's education, the report found.      Across the United States, about 40 million Americans are paying back some 1.1 trillion in student loan debt.      Student loans are a particular concern because unlike credit card debt or mortgages, they are typically government-backed and cannot be written off in bankruptcy proceedings, leaving retirees facing the risk of having their Social Security payments garnished to cover student loans.      The cost of higher education in the United States has steadily increased over the past decade, with one year's costs for tuition, room and board, and other fees at the average four-year U.S. college coming to 23,872 for the 2012-2013 academic year, according to Department of Education data. That is up 21 percent, accounting for inflation.      \\"Education debt has become a significant factor for younger workers, threatening a middle-class standard of living and at times even forcing some to delay their retirement,\\" said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP, the largest lobbying group representing retired Americans. \\"Student loan debt is also becoming a matter of serious concern for some older Americans many of who are still paying off their kids' debt or helping their grandkids well into their ‎retirement.\\"      (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Mohammad Zargham) ||||| Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images      Most conversations about the dangers of student debt rightfully focus on the young. But a surprising number of elderly Americans are also still paying back education loans. And today, the Government Accountability Office unveiled a rather depressing report about how the government may be driving some of those retirees into poverty in its attempts to collect on their debt.      Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.      The problem stems from the way Washington handles defaults. Once a borrower has failed to pay back his federal loan for 425 days, the government has the power to withhold Social Security retirement and disability payments to offset the debt. In 2013, the GAO reports that 155,000 Americans, including 36,000 individuals older than 65, saw their benefits garnished in this fashion.      Advertisement            Because Social Security is designed to keep the elderly and infirm from falling into destitution, Congress very sensibly limited how much money the Treasury Department could withhold from their benefits when collecting on a student loan. Much less sensibly, the cap wasn’t indexed for inflation and hasn’t been updated since the 1990s. As a result, the GAO reports that, \\"the current limits may result in monthly benefits below the poverty threshold for certain defaulted borrowers.\\"      To translate that into the clearest terms possible: Due to Congress' neglect, our government is now probably pushing somebody's grandparents into poverty so that they can settle up a bad college debt.            Get Slate in your inbox.      How many people are we talking about here? The report’s numbers are slightly opaque, but it looks like about 129,000 Americans total, including 27,000 senior citizens, would have kept more of their Social Security payments if the withholding limits had kept pace with the poverty line.1 We don’t know for sure that every one of these individuals is being driven into poverty, since some of them may have income from other sources. But the fact that we even have to worry about the possibility is disturbing.      In the end, we’re only talking about a problem afflicting a relative handful of people. But that also means it would be fairly painless to fix. Fixing the withholding limits to make sure nobody’s benefit payments fell below the poverty level would have cost just 94 million in 2013. This does not seem like a hard trade-off to make.      Of course, the really humane thing would be to finally let Americans discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, so they aren’t dogged by their borrowing mistakes deep into old age. But baby steps first.      * * * ||||| Financial Aid      Elderly Americans have more student loan debt than ever and are more likely to become chronically unable to make payments than younger borrowers. Those findings from a new report by the Government Accountability Office took center stage at Wednesday’s Senate hearing on how seniors deal with unprecedented education debt.      Federal student debt among Americans 65 and older increased sixfold since 2005, reaching 18.2 billion in 2013, according to the report. Over 80 percent of elderly borrowers were still struggling to pay off loans they took out to pay for their education, which suggests that the debt ballooned, in part, due to interest.      United States Government Accountability Office      Seniors hold a small minority of all student debt in the country, but their fate is a cautionary tale for today’s students taking out more and bigger loans. It is also a sign of financial stress to come for people who are heading toward retirement.      Some 31 percent of the student loans held by Americans aged 65 and older were in default last year. That makes the elderly about twice as likely to hold defaulted loans as Americans under the age of 50. Defaulting on student loans is bad for anyone: It can harm your credit and multiply your debt by adding fees. For older Americans, the consequences can be especially dire.      United States Government Accountability Office      More elderly Americans are seeing retirement benefits cut to order to repay education debt, as Bloomberg Businessweek reported last month. The government reduced the Social Security payments or other retirement benefits of 155,000 people last year to pay off student loans, according to the new GAO report, up from just 31,000 in 2002.      A 1998 law specified that the government could not seize more than 15 percent of people’s retirement benefits or leave them with a check of less than 750. At the time that limit was above the poverty line. The limit hasn’t since increased and is now about 181 under the poverty threshold for a person over the age of 65.      Most of those who saw Social Security payments slashed to repay student loans in 2013 were living on benefit income that was under the poverty line. “If the offset limit had been indexed to match the rate of increase in the poverty threshold,” the report noted, “in 2013, 68 percent of all borrowers whose Social Security benefits were offset for federal student loan debt would have kept their entire benefit.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A recent federal report reveals that the rising cost of higher education in the US is following Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans. While relatively few households headed by people 65 or older carry student loans, the value of the unpaid debt has increased from 2.8 billion in 2005, before the financial crisis. The cost of higher education in the US has steadily increased over the past decade, causing a middle-class standard of living and even forcing some to delay their retirement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because radioactive decay is the process through which isotopes turn into different elements by either losing or gaining particles. When the isotopes are stable and have a lower tendency of turning into different elements, the overall radioactive decay in the affected system will be reduced. In the given scenario, the supposed perturbation (fewer isotopes turning into different elements) will lead to LESS effect on the second effect mentioned (radioactive decay).

However, it is essential to critically analyze the various components of this hypothesis and assess their validity in conjunction with the given premise. Firstly, the premise highlights that minor clerical errors, such as typographical errors, can lead to appeals. An appeal, in this context, refers to a legal process wherein a case or judgment is reviewed by a higher court. Such errors are described as seemingly insignificant and perhaps difficult to detect. Yet, these errors can provide grounds for an appeal, as suggested by the \\"appeal the hell out of that\\" statement. This implies that minor clerical errors can indeed lead to time-consuming and resource-draining appeals. The premise then goes on to say that these appeals take two years to be resolved. Although the exact time frame could vary depending on the complexity of the case, system efficiency, and legal jurisdiction, the underlying notion is that such appeals prolong the legal process considerably. Assuming the mentioned figure is accurate, a minor clerical error has the potential to tie up an appeal for two years. Finally, the premise asserts that the issue of multiple appeals stemming from minor clerical errors is bogging down the whole system. \\"Bogging down\\" implies that the legal system is becoming increasingly burdened and less efficient as a result of these appeals. This can likely be attributed to the accumulation of cases waiting for resolution and the diversion of resources to handle these appeals, which could otherwise be allocated to address more significant legal concerns. As such, considering the premise, the hypothesis does seem to be true. It suggests that a minor clerical error can potentially tie up an appeal for two years and that the cumulative effect of numerous such appeals is bogging down the whole system. However, it is essential to recognize that the actual timeframes and impact may differ across legal systems and jurisdictions, as well as the efficiency and workload of the courts involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CLOSE 50th Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich discusses Trump's possible appointment of Mitt Romney as Secretary of State with USA TODAY Washington bureau chief Susan Page. USA TODAY      Former House speaker Newt Gingrich on USA TODAY's Capital Download (Photo: Sean Dougherty, USAT)      WASHINGTON — Former House speaker Newt Gingrich calls Donald Trump a potentially transformative president. But he shouldn't have sent out that tweet alleging election fraud.      In an interview Tuesday with Capital Download, Gingrich, a free-wheeling Trump adviser who is a vice-chairman of his transition team, described the president-elect as a leader who is poised to disrupt the regular order in a way no commander in chief has done since Andrew Jackson in the 19th century.      But he also said that Trump's biggest misstep in the three weeks since he won the White House was to post on Twitter Sunday a complaint asserting widespread voter fraud, and in an election he won. \\"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide,\\" Trump wrote, \\"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\\"      \\"The president of the United States can't randomly tweet without having somebody check it out,\\" Gingrich told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \\"It makes you wonder about whatever else he's doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet.\\"      Does he see any evidence of millions of illegal votes?      \\"No,\\" Gingrich says.      The former House speaker, who led a political disruption of his own when Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1994, says the best thing Trump has done so far is to name campaign chairman Steve Bannon and Republican national chairman Reince Priebus to his top White House staff. \\"You have a very hard-line conservative warrior as your chief strategist and you have a really sophisticated manager of the establishment as your chief of staff,\\" he says.      That said, Gingrich is caustic toward another potential Trump appointment, of Mitt Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. Trump and Romney were slated to meet Tuesday for a second time, reportedly to discuss the role of secretary of State for the GOP's 2012 nominee, who was perhaps Trump's fiercest Republican critic during the campaign.      \\"I think it's outrageous,\\" Gingrich says. \\"Romney said vile and vicious things. Romney opposed him all the way up to the election. In my judgment, Romney will be a very high risk ... because I think Romney has zero interest in the Trump revolution and every interest in re-establishing his own credentials.\\"      While he views former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as a better choice, Gingrich says House Speaker Paul Ryan \\"is very strongly in favor of Romney\\" and that Priebus is \\"pretty strongly\\" in favor of him. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, however, has warned of a grassroots revolt if Romney is named to the Cabinet's top job.      When he met with Trump last week, Gingrich says, \\"He commented, 'This is really a bigger job than I thought.' Which is good. He should think that.\\" As president, Gingrich went on, \\"you have war and peace, you have enormous powers ... and it all comes down to the Oval Office and it all comes down to you.\\"      He argues that Trump, who hasn't held a news conference since July, should feel no obligation to hold any as president, suggesting instead he solicit questions from the public to answer. \\"The news media so totally disgraced itself in this election, if I were Trump I would just say no,\\" Gingrich says. \\"And if the White House Correspondents Association doesn't like it, I'd say, 'Fine, disband.'\\"      Gingrich says the political world hasn't yet come to grips with the sort of fundamental change the election of \\"the most insurgent president in American history\\" could bring. He describes Trump as \\"one-third Andrew Jackson in disruption, one-third Theodore Roosevelt in sheer energy, and one-third P.T. Barnum in selling all the time.\\"      But he says Trump might need to occasionally curb his instincts.      \\"He should tweet, but he ought to have an editorial board in-between the first draft and sending it,\\" he suggests — not an idea Trump seems likely to accept. \\"But he shouldn't give it up, and he shouldn't give up being Donald Trump. He got elected being this unique, charismatic, entrepreneurial guy who breaks lots of rules. ... If he starts getting to be normal, he'll cease being Donald J.

Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap.  Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar.

By choosing to enter into a marriage with Rashid, Laila is taking an essential step in ensuring the child will grow up in a stable and loving environment with access to essential resources. There are several aspects that contribute to why Laila makes this decision. Firstly, marrying Rashid provides the unborn child with a stable family structure. In many societies, a solid family unit is seen as crucial for the healthy upbringing of a child, as it fosters a sense of belonging and security. By marrying Rashid, Laila acknowledges the importance of committing to a partnership that will lay down a strong foundation for their child's emotional and social development.

A marriage with Rashid promises a certain level of financial stability, which is crucial for meeting the basic needs of the child, such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Providing for these needs is a priority for Laila, as she understands that they contribute significantly to the child's physical and mental well-being. In addition, Laila considers the importance of surrounding the child with love and nurturing relationships. In marrying Rashid, she anticipates that they will both take an active role in parenting, guiding, and supporting the child through life's challenges and milestones. The mutual support and partnership of a loving marriage can help instill a strong sense of self-esteem and confidence in the child, which are fundamental building blocks for a healthy and happy life. Furthermore, Laila realizes that by marrying Rashid, she may be setting an example for the child when it comes to values and beliefs related to commitment, partnership, and understanding.

This 4-star review will present an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of the app to help potential users make an informed decision. Firstly, the Wikipedia app has a sleek user interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. This makes for a smooth and enjoyable experience when searching for a specific article or merely browsing through a plethora of topics. The app also adjusts well to different screen sizes and orientations, making it a great resource for any mobile device user. Secondly, the app's offline support feature is incredibly handy. By downloading articles to read offline, I am able to access the app's wealth of information even in areas with limited or no internet connection. This has been particularly beneficial during long flights, boring commutes, and any other unexpected offline scenario since I always have access to reliable and in-depth articles. In addition to these two prominent features, the Wikipedia app has a few other qualities worth mentioning. The night mode option is a fantastic feature that reduces eye strain during late-night reading sessions. Furthermore, the app's integration with its sister sites, such as Wikidata or Wikimedia Commons, enhances the overall user experience and creates a complete knowledge base beyond just text-based articles. The language support is also commendable, with the app providing access to articles written in an impressively wide range of languages. There are, however, a few aspects of the Wikipedia app with the package org.wikipedia that could be improved. One minor flaw is the occasional slow load times for images and media within the articles. This issue can be frustrating, especially when using the app in areas with slower internet connections. Additionally, while the app's search function is generally adequate, it sometimes struggles with predictive suggestions and matching search queries to the most relevant results. Another point of concern is the reliability of the content. Although most articles are well-researched and informative, the content's user-generated nature means that some inaccuracies might be present. While this is true for all Wikipedia content, users should be aware of this potential drawback when using the app as a primary research source. Always consider validating the information found in the app with external sources. In conclusion, the app with the package org.wikipedia is a highly useful and comprehensive learning tool on multiple subjects, accommodating users seeking information on-the-go or offline. Despite the occasional slow load times and the potential unreliability of certain content, I believe the merits of this app far outweigh its drawbacks. I confidently rate the Wikipedia app at 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a user-friendly, informative, and versatile knowledge database on their mobile devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Using \\"Monday mornings\\" as our topic, I will use language that conveys a negative sentiment without crossing the line into overly severe or offensive territory. Step 3: Check tweet for alignment with sentiment. Given that the intent is to create a negative sentiment, I need to use words and phrases that generally elicit such feelings. Phrases like \\"struggling\\", \\"need more sleep\\", and \\"weekend is over\\" typically carry a negative connotation. I'll avoid using positive or neutral words to keep the tone consistent. So, here is a draft of the tweet that aligns with these steps: \\"Monday mornings are always so rough! Struggling to open my eyes.

Answer:","output":"Carbon fixation occurs in a somewhat unique manner in C4 plants as compared to other plant types. In C4 plants, the process of carbon fixation takes place in two distinct locations within the leaf, primarily the mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells, through a two-step mechanism. Before addressing the locations, it's essential to understand why C4 plants have evolved this method. C4 plants have adapted to thrive in environments with high temperatures, intense sunlight, and limited water availability. These conditions cause the typical carbon fixation process in C3 plants to operate less efficiently due to a phenomenon called photorespiration. C4 plants, like corn, sorghum, and sugar cane, use a more efficient way to capture carbon dioxide and minimize photorespiration. The process of carbon fixation in C4 plants begins in the mesophyll cells, which are found within the leaf tissue surrounding the bundle sheath cells. In the first step, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a three-carbon compound, binds with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of the enzyme PEP carboxylase, forming a four-carbon compound called oxaloacetate. This step distinguishes C4 plants and gives them their name. Next, the C4 plant processes the oxaloacetate to form malate or aspartate, both of which are four-carbon compounds capable of transporting carbon dioxide. These compounds then move from the mesophyll cells to the bundle sheath cells, a layer of cells lining the vascular tissue responsible for carrying water and nutrients throughout the plant. Inside the bundle sheath cells, malate or aspartate release the carbon dioxide they transported from the mesophyll cells, thus providing a high concentration of carbon dioxide for the Calvin cycle to take place. The high CO2 concentration minimizes photorespiration, giving C4 plants an advantage in warmer and drier environments. The carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which is mainly located in bundle sheath cells, as part of the Calvin cycle. Upon the release of CO2, the remaining three-carbon molecules (pyruvate or alanine) are transported back to the mesophyll cells, where they are converted back to PEP using ATP generated during photosynthesis. The regenerated PEP is then ready to begin the next round of carbon fixation in the mesophyll cells. In summary, carbon fixation in C4 plants occurs in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. The process enhances their photosynthetic capacity in high light, high temperature, and water-limited conditions by minimizing the energy-wasting process of photorespiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the sun begins to dip below the horizon, the man finds that the evening light casts a warm, golden glow on the buildings around him. He takes a moment to appreciate the architectural beauty of the cityscape, a mix of old and new, where historic buildings stand strong alongside innovative modern designs. He eventually arrives at a quaint, hole-in-the-wall coffee shop situated in one of the less-traveled alleys of the city – a true hidden gem that he had discovered on his many walks through the area. As he enters, the wafting aromas of freshly roasted beans and mouthwatering pastries greet him, tugging at his senses and urging him to indulge. The man orders his usual – a robust black coffee accompanied by a flaky, buttery croissant – and takes a seat at one of the cozy nooks tucked in the back of the shop. A familiar face, the barista greets him with a warm smile and welcomes him back. In this peaceful sanctuary, the man pulls out a notebook and a pen and begins to write. He has often found solace in expressing his thoughts and emotions through words, reflecting on his experiences and observations of the world around him. The coffee shop has become his safe haven, a place where he can escape the chaos of the city and find a sense of inner clarity. As the hours pass, night fully envelops the city, and the once-bustling streets begin to quiet down. People return to their homes, exhausted from a long day's work, while shadows dance under the cold, silver glow of the streetlights. And yet, inside the little coffee shop, the man continues to write well into the night, enveloped in his own cocoon of thoughts, feelings, and artistic expression. His pen strokes paint a unique world of their own, reflecting his experiences and intertwining with the innumerable tales that the city has to share. Eventually, the man closes his notebook and pays for his coffee and croissant, saying his goodbyes to the barista before venturing out into the silent urban jungle. With his skateboard by his side, he navigates the sleeping streets, fully aware that tomorrow, he will return to his safe haven, ready to witness and document the ever-changing tapestry of human existence within the heart of the city."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Can not get it to work Keep getting errors\\" The answer is:","output":"★"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit...

Let's break down the elements of this sentence to better understand the sentiment. 1. \\"even if you're an agnostic carnivore\\": This phrase sets a context that the statement goes beyond the usual target audience, which can be seen as an inclusive perspective. The mention of \\"agnostic carnivore\\" might also add a touch of humor by using unexpected terminology to describe the reader or someone who may not be immediately inclined to enjoy the subject in question. 2. \\"you can enjoy much of Jonah simply, and gratefully\\": The sentiment here is also positive, as it suggests that the person would be able to appreciate and find enjoyment in \\"Jonah.\\" The adverbs \\"simply\\" and \\"gratefully\\" indicate that this enjoyment doesn't require extensive effort or a particular mindset—allowing the person to appreciate it naturally and be thankful for the experience. 3. \\"as laugh-out-loud lunacy\\": This phrase adds another positive aspect, as it describes the humor in \\"Jonah\\" as so funny that it's capable of provoking laughter out loud. The term \\"lunacy\\" might be seen as a mildly negative connotation, but in this context, it's used to emphasize the level of humor and absurdity that many individuals find enjoyable. 4. \\"with a pronounced Monty Pythonesque flavor\\": The comparison to Monty Python, a well-known and beloved British comedy group, adds an additional positive sentiment to the statement. Describing the humor as \\"pronounced\\" emphasizes that this is a major aspect of the experience, and a strong influence that fans of Monty Python comedy would particularly appreciate. By evaluating these components of the sentence, we can conclude that the overall sentiment is positive. The statement acknowledges the humor and enjoyment in \\"Jonah,\\" even for individuals who might not be the typical target audience, and identifies similarities to the widely appreciated Monty Python comedy.

Q:Information:  - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation .  - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources.  - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include:  - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation.  - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention.  - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal.  - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics.  - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.  - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations.  - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\"  - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\"    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'facet of' with the subject 'similarity '.

Question: Given the background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  and the situation: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Answer the following question: Which person studied more about the stable state? Answer:","output":"Paul studied more about the stable state because he focused on the Gaia hypothesis, which revolves around the concept of Earth as a self-regulating entity that maintains a stable state, also known as homeostasis. This hypothesis particularly emphasizes the balance and consistency of atmospheric conditions that support life on Earth. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which primarily deals with the fundamental principles of space, time, and gravitation, rather than concepts related to stable states or homeostasis."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],q={key:0},j={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
