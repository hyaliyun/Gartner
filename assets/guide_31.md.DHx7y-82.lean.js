Problem:The EPA issued a certificate to Boston-based GE saying that it has completed its remedial action under the federal Superfund program. Critics of the cleanup wanted the EPA to withhold the certificate and to demand further dredging. EPA Regional Administrator Peter Lopez said more time and testing are needed to fully assess the 1.7 billion cleanup that GE has done, and he stressed that the company can still be compelled in the coming decades to do more work, including additional dredging. “GE is not off the hook,” Lopez told reporters during a conference call. “If new information comes in that causes EPA to conclude that more work is needed to protect public health and the environment, we can and will require GE to take that action.” Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, promptly announced they intend to sue the EPA over its decision. They claim levels of the contaminating polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, remain unacceptably high in the river sediment and in fish. Scenic Hudson and Riverkeeper, two environmental groups lobbying for additional dredging, said they would support litigation. “Since the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for fulfilling its obligation to restore the river, New York state will take any action necessary to protect our waterways and that includes suing the EPA to demand a full and complete remediation,’” Cuomo said in a written news release. “Anything less is unacceptable.” Cuomo accused the Republican Trump Administration of putting corporations’ interests ahead of public health and the environment. EPA officials said their decision was guided by Superfund law and science. The EPA said in a “five-year review” of the river released Friday that there is not enough testing data on fish, water and sediment yet to determine if the cleanup will succeed in its goal of protecting human health and the environment. Lopez said that will take more time and monitoring before a conclusion could be reached. The review found some signs of progress in removing highly contaminated sediment, though it found three spots in the upper river with slightly elevated levels of PCBs. Until the mid-1970s, GE factories discharged more than 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of PCBs into the river. The probable carcinogen, used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment, was banned in 1977. GE said the EPA’s decision confirms the success of the project. “GE will continue to collect environmental data to assess ongoing improvements in river conditions and to work closely with EPA, New York State, and local communities on other Hudson environmental projects,” the company said in a written statement. Solution:","output":"The EPA has issued a certificate to GE stating that they have completed their remedial action under the federal Superfund program, but officials emphasize that the company can still be compelled to do more work, including additional dredging, if necessary in the future."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Very Very Dissapointed!!!!

A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys’ restroom next school year. The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Summarize this article: A few days ago, popular British author Jeffrey Archer was in the city to launch his latest book when he had a taste of Bangalore's notorious traffic jams. \\"A woman walking on the pavement overtook my car eight times and my car overtook her eight times. Two more times and we would have been engaged,\\" he later told the more than 3,000 fans who had gathered for the event. The writer's humour made his fans smile, but many Bangaloreans stuck daily in the city's nightmarish jams are not amused. I've visited Bangalore many times in the past, but this time whenever I called anyone to fix an appointment, the directions came with a warning, \\"Start early to factor in traffic delays.\\" \\"The traffic is definitely a mess here,\\" says transport and traffic expert Prof MN Sreehari. \\"It's faster to walk than drive.\\" \\"In 2005, traffic moved at the speed of 35km (22 miles) an hour; in 2014, it had slowed down to 9.2km (5.7 miles),\\" says Pawan Mulukutla of the non-profit World Resource Institute, adding that \\"at traffic junctions, the wait time is more than five minutes when it should ideally be two-three minutes.\\" Today, at peak times, the speed is just 4-5km on the city's key Outer Ring Road. Reports say an average citizen spends more than 240 hours stuck in jams every year and Prof Sreehari estimates that traffic delays cost the city 65bn rupees (950m; £760m) a year. So why is Bangalore gridlocked? Everyone I spoke to agreed that it was because of the rapid - and unplanned - growth of the city. Bangalore is often described as the Silicon Valley of India as it is home to the IT industry. Since the early 1990s, global technology firms began opening offices here and a large number of support industries have grown around it, bringing with them a huge influx of people from all over India. \\"Bangalore became the new El Dorado,\\" says city resident V Ravichandar. \\"And the population grew from 5.6 million in 2001 to 8.7 million in 2011. Today, it's estimated to have reached 11.5 million.\\" Mr Mulukutla says the population has doubled, but the infrastructure has failed to keep pace. \\"We have only 6,500-7,000 public buses to carry 45% of the city's traffic. The Metro construction has been very slow. Work on the first line started in 2007 and so far only 28km of the 42km line have opened. Work on the second phase has not even begun. And deadlines keep getting pushed.\\" So most people are dependent on private transport. Prof Sreehari says the city has 6.6 million private vehicles, including one million cars. And every day, another million vehicles enter from outside the city, clogging its already choked streets. Adding to the problem, he says, is the fact that one-third of the city roads are taken away by parking and encroachments. The woman whose daughter's death led her to save others Thanksgiving traffic jam is 'most epic' \\"Roads are meant for traffic, but there's parking everywhere. Footpaths are meant for pedestrians, but they are occupied by hawkers and vendors.\\" So is there a way out? \\"We need firm decisions from the authorities, but there is a lack of vision,\\" believes Prof Sreehari. \\"More than 3,500 vehicles are registered in the city daily. That number needs to be restricted. We need to make licensing stricter, car purchases should be taxed heavily and heavy fines should be charged to curb roadside parking,\\" he says. Mr Ravichandar says the answer lies in faster public transport. \\"We need more investment in public transport. If we increase the number of buses to 9,500 to 10,000, it will make a difference,\\" he says. \\"The government instead comes up with ideas like constructing a steel bridge and elevated corridors,\\" says Mr Mulukutla. \\"Building new flyovers can change the pain point, but they are not a permanent solution,\\" he adds. Prof Sreehari says any new flyover will be clogged in five years. \\"What we need is a comprehensive integrated sustainable public transport system, something like a central transport authority like you have in London or Singapore. Our culture of working in silos and different transport systems, not talking to each other, is not going to work.\\" But as that is unlikely to happen soon, the situation is \\"expected to get worse before it gets better\\", says Mr Ravichandar. Bangalore, at least in the near future, will continue to remain gridlocked.","output":"Renowned British author, Jeffrey Archer, recently experienced the traffic congestion that haunts the city of Bangalore. With its rapid, unplanned growth due to the IT industry boom, the population has surged to a current estimated 11.5 million from 5.6 million in 2001. Failing to keep pace with the increasing population, Bangalore's infrastructure is overburdened with a lack of suitable public transport, with many citizens relying on private vehicles that clog the streets. Traffic and transport expert Prof MN Sreehari suggests more stringent regulations involving the restriction of vehicle registrations, heavy taxation on car purchases, and strict fines to curb roadside parking, while city resident V Ravichandar emphasizes faster public transport as the solution. More comprehensive initiatives and integrated transport systems are needed, but current problems are expected to worsen before any significant improvement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.  Now, I have a new situation: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.  Answer this question please: Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample C would not be fissionable.  Sample C consists of uranium-238 (U-238) isotope, which is not fissionable. To clarify, fission is a nuclear process in which an atomic nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, along with the release of a significant amount of energy. This energy, in the form of heat, is harnessed to produce electricity in nuclear reactors.  In contrast, Sample D consists of uranium-235 (U-235), which is fissionable and used as a fuel in nuclear reactors. As mentioned in the background information provided, naturally occurring uranium comprises about 99% of U-238 and 1% of U-235. To be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor, the percentage of U-235 in uranium must be increased to at least 3%. This process is called enrichment, and the resulting product is enriched uranium (Sample B in this situation).  Given that John is a nuclear scientist working at the Fermi lab, his goal would likely involve selecting the appropriate uranium sample for use as a fuel in a reactor or a similar application. As Sample C (U-238) is not fissionable, it is not ideal for use as fuel. However, Sample D (U-235) can be utilized for this purpose, as can Sample B (enriched uranium), which has a higher percentage of U-235 content than naturally occurring uranium (Sample A)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which British airport has the IATA code, seen on luggage labels, LCY????","output":"The British airport with the IATA code LCY seen on luggage labels is London City Airport. London City Airport is a smaller international airport, located in the Royal Docks within the London Borough of Newham, approximately 6.9 miles (11.1 km) east of the City of London, and 3 miles (4.8 km) from Canary Wharf. The airport has a single runway and operates primarily for short-haul, business, and regional flights within Europe. London City Airport (IATA: LCY, ICAO: EGLC) was officially inaugurated in 1987 by Queen Elizabeth II, with a vision to connect the UK's capital city with key European destinations for both business and leisure travelers. Owing to its unique location in the heart of the city, it offers quick and easy access to some of London's important financial, commercial, and cultural centers. The airport's short runway, as well as the steep approach required for landing, means that not all commercial aircraft types can operate here. Only aircraft with STOL (short take-off and landing) capabilities can use the airport, which is one of the reasons that LCY primarily serves regional and short-haul flights. Some of the popular airlines operating at London City Airport include British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Swiss, and Alitalia, among others. London City Airport enjoys excellent transportation links with various parts of the city, such as the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which connects the airport to the London Underground network. Passengers can also use taxis, buses, and private car services to reach the airport and various points in London. In recent years, London City Airport has seen significant growth in passenger numbers, with an increasing number of routes being added. The airport handled over 5 million passengers in 2018 and continues to expand its facilities, invest in new technology, and improve its passenger experience. To summarize, London City Airport, with the IATA code LCY, is a convenient and accessible option for travelers seeking quick access to London's major business and leisure destinations. Its unique location, transport connections, and efficient operations make it a popular choice for connecting the UK capital with key European cities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although sponges might also be classified under organic compounds, the term keystone species more specifically and accurately describes their role in the ecosystem. Sponges, which belong to the phylum Porifera, are simple aquatic animals that primarily inhabit marine environments, but some species can also be found in freshwater ecosystems. They are sessile, filter-feeding organisms that attach themselves to surfaces such as rocks, coral reefs, and the ocean floor. The body structure of sponges consists of a porous outer layer, a central hollow cavity, and an inner layer of cells called choanocytes. Sponges function as keystone species in several ways. They serve as a significant food source for many species of fish, as well as invertebrates such as sea turtles and sea slugs. Through the process of filter-feeding, sponges contribute to maintaining water quality by removing bacteria, microalgae, and organic debris from the water column. This not only benefits the sponges themselves but also supports other organisms within the ecosystem. Moreover, sponges provide crucial habitat and shelter for a wide range of marine species. They create three-dimensional structures on the ocean floor and within coral reefs, offering protection and sanctuary to many fish species and other marine organisms. A variety of organisms also live in symbiotic relationships with sponges, including algae, bacteria, and various types of invertebrates. In conclusion, sponges, as keystone species, play vital ecological roles in their ecosystems. They support numerous species by supplying them with food, offering shelter and protection, and helping maintain water quality. Based on the information provided, it is clear that the best answer to the question \\"What are a source of food for many fish species?\\" is keystone species, given that sponges are considered keystone species and a primary food source for numerous fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Examine for eye inflammation, redness, or clear discomfort when exposed to bright light, which may be a sign of Uveitis - another possible autoimmune disorder in huskies. Moreover, check for any changes in vision or eye-closing behavior, as this may suggest an eye disease associated with autoimmune disorder, specially in aging huskies.  While examining the eyes, also investigate the dog's behavior. A husky with an autoimmune disorder may be lethargic or may show a decreased interest in activities that they previously enjoyed, like playing fetch or going for walks. In conjunction, you may also notice changes in appetite or unusual weight loss, which directly signifies an internal health issue. Pay attention to any changes in your husky's mobility. In particular, look for asymmetrical movement, lameness, or limping, which may suggest an autoimmune disease called Immune-Mediated Polyarthritis (IMPA). This is a condition in which the immune system targets the dog's joints, causing inflammation and pain. Check for other physical discomforts such as excessive scratching or signs of skin infection. Your husky may be suffering from a condition called Lupus, which is another autoimmune disorder that can cause skin problems and discomfort.  Also check your husky's breathing pattern. Difficulty breathing can be a symptom of Pneumonitis, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the lungs. If your dog struggles to breathe after short walks or while resting, it could be a concerning symptom. Your husky may exhibit fever, which is an indicator of an abnormal immune response. The animal's body temperature can easily be checked at home with a pet thermometer.  If you notice any of these signs or symptoms in your husky, it is crucial to take your dog to a vet immediately. They can perform the necessary tests and provide professional assessment for a proper diagnosis of any potential autoimmune disorder. Remember, early detection and treatment of autoimmune disorders can significantly improve the prognosis for your Siberian husky. All these symptoms may overlap with other health issues, so a precise diagnosis should be made by a veterinarian. The vet will be able to examine your dog, review the symptoms, and perform tests to confirm the presence of an autoimmune disorder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SONY BID COULD #39;VE SAVED DISNEY  A former Walt Disney Co. director testified that CEO Michael Eisner hoped that Sony Corp. would take Michael Ovitz off his hands and save Disney a  quot;bundle quot; in severance pay. What is this text about?","output":"This text pertains to a situation involving the Walt Disney Company, its CEO Michael Eisner, and Michael Ovitz, who previously served as the president of the company. The text highlights a testimony from a former Walt Disney Co. director who claimed that CEO Michael Eisner was hoping for Sony Corporation to hire Michael Ovitz. The primary reason behind Eisner's intent was to avoid paying a hefty amount in severance pay to Ovitz upon his departure from Disney. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, here's some background information. Michael Ovitz, a co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and a well-known Hollywood talent agent, was hired by Michael Eisner as the president of The Walt Disney Company in 1995. However, Ovitz's tenure at Disney turned out to be tumultuous and lasted only about a year. His time at the company was marked by clashes with Eisner, financial troubles, and controversial executive decisions. Ovitz eventually left Disney in 1996, with a severance package worth around 140 million, sparking numerous shareholder lawsuits against the company and its board of directors. According to the text, Eisner had hoped for Sony Corporation to hire Ovitz, which would have facilitated Ovitz's departure from Disney without the company having to pay the expensive severance package. This move would have potentially saved Disney a significant amount of money, as emphasized by the phrase \\"save Disney a 'bundle' in severance pay.\\" In summary, the text discusses a situation in which Michael Eisner, then-CEO of Disney, wished for Sony Corporation to employ Michael Ovitz, thereby allowing Disney to avoid paying a large severance package upon his exit from the company. The text emphasizes the financial aspect of the story, focusing on Disney's potential monetary benefits if Sony had intervened in the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.  Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ?  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

News article: Well - From Title IX, Evidence of Sports Lasting Effects - NYTimes.com Almost four decades after the federal education law called Title IX opened the door for girls to participate in high school and college athletics, a crucial question has remained unanswered: Do sports make a long-term difference in a woman’s life? A large body of research shows that sports are associated with all sorts of benefits, like lower teenage pregnancy rates, better grades and higher self-esteem. But until now, no one has determined whether those improvements are a direct result of athletic participation. It may be that the type of girl who is attracted to sports already has the social, personal and physical qualities  like ambition, strength and supportive parents  that will help her succeed in life. Now, separate studies from two economists offer some answers, providing the strongest evidence yet that team sports can result in lifelong improvements to educational, work and health prospects. At a time when the first lady, Michelle Obama, has begun a nationwide campaign to improve schoolchildren’s health, the lessons from Title IX show that school-based fitness efforts can have lasting effects. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 required schools and colleges receiving federal money to provide the same opportunities for girls as they did for boys. Relatively few students, male or female, participate in intercollegiate sports. But the effects in high school were remarkable. Just six years after the enactment of Title IX, the percentage of girls playing team sports had jumped sixfold, to 25 percent from about 4 percent. Most research on Title IX has looked at national trends in girls’ sports. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has taken it a step further, focusing on state-by-state variations. “I looked to see what it means to add sports to girls’ lives,” she said. “How does it change things for them?” States with large boys’ sports programs had to make bigger changes to achieve parity than states with smaller programs. Looking at the state-by-state statistics allowed Dr. Stevenson to narrow her focus, comparing differences in sports participation with differences in women’s educational and work achievement. So her study untangles the effects of sports participation from other confounding factors  school size, climate, social and personal differences among athletes  and comes far closer to determining a cause and effect relationship between high school sports participation and achievement later in life. Using a complex analysis, Dr. Stevenson showed that increasing girls’ sports participation had a direct effect on women’s education and employment. She found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women’s education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women. “It’s not just that the people who are going to do well in life play sports, but that sports help people do better in life,” she said, adding, “While I only show this for girls, it’s reasonable to believe it’s true for boys as well.” Another question is whether Title IX has made a difference in women’s long-term health. In a carefully conducted study, Robert Kaestner, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, compared rates of obesity and physical activity of women who had been in high school in the 1970s  as Title IX was taking effect  with similar women from earlier years. Controlling the results for other influences, like age and changing diets, Dr. Kaestner was able to tease out the effects Title IX had on women’s health. He found that the increase in girls’ athletic participation caused by Title IX was associated with a 7 percent lower risk of obesity 20 to 25 years later, when women were in their late 30s and early 40s. His article was published this month in the journal Evaluation Review. Dr. Kaestner notes that while a 7 percent decline in obesity is modest, no other public health program can claim similar success. And other studies have shown that even a small drop in weight can lower risk for diabetes and other health problems. There is still room for improvement. Today about 1 in 3 high school girls play sports, compared with about half of all boys. And participation varies widely by state, according to Dr. Stevenson’s research. Southern states like Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee still have big gender gaps, while Northern states like Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Vermont are closer to parity. “While we have more girls than ever before, we still have far more boys playing sports than girls,” said Nicole M. LaVoi, associate director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota. “The research clearly states that when anybody, boys and girls, are physically active, they can reap developmental and health benefits. But we haven’t reached equality yet.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Write an article based on this \\"Thousands of children in England are missing out on an education, the National Children's Bureau says.\\"","output":"Title: The Lost Generation: Thousands of Children in England Denied Education Introduction: The National Children's Bureau (NCB) recently raised concerns regarding the educational crisis in England, where thousands of children reportedly lack access to quality education. According to the NCB, the situation is dire and necessitates an urgent response to prevent an entire generation of young people from falling behind. This article delves into the underlying reasons, explores the effects of the crisis, and outlines potential solutions that can be put into place. Step 1: Describing the Situation England's education system, often lauded for its prestige and envied by others, has come under scrutiny due to the NCB's alarming report. This authoritative body has found that a staggering number of children are missing out on their educational rights, which poses a significant threat to their development and future. The failure in ensuring education availability can lead to long-term socioeconomic impacts on society as a whole. Step 2: Investigating the Reasons In order to address the issue, it's vital first to understand the factors contributing to this dire predicament. Research points to multiple contributing factors: 1. Budget cuts: Government financial restrictions have resulted in cutting support and resources for schools and local authorities, restricting their ability to provide essential services to students in need. 2. Inadequate special needs support: Children with special needs require tailored assistance, and the current support system is struggling to keep up with demand, leaving many children unable to access a suitable education. 3. A lack of resources and staff: Insufficient funding has caused a shortage of teachers and educational resources, creating a weakened education infrastructure. 4. Increased school exclusions: Many schools are ill-equipped to deal with children who exhibit disruptive or challenging behavior, leading to a spike in school exclusions, and subsequently, the lack of educational access for these children. Step 3: Analyzing the Impact The implications of this crisis are far-reaching, affecting these children in terms of development, economic prospects, and mental well-being. Some likely consequences include: 1. Lower attainment: A lack of education leads to a diminished capacity to unlock the child's full potential, leaving them disadvantaged compared to their peers. 2. Limited career prospects: Education provides access to higher education and improves career prospects, ultimately elevating an individual's long-term earning potential. 3. Poor mental health: Studies have linked limited education access with increased depression and anxiety levels, impacting on overall mental health and well-being. 4. The lost generation: Uneducated children become a growing concern for society, lacking essential skills to contribute positively to the community. Step 4: Potential Solutions To address this issue and ensure that every child has access to their rightfully deserved education, several proposals have been put forth: 1. Additional investment: Increasing funding for schools and local authorities is essential in providing appropriate support and resources to students, especially those in need. 2. Special needs reform: A comprehensive reevaluation and improvement of the support system for children with special needs should be prioritized, providing them with the necessary means to access a suitable education. 3. Improved teacher training: Better-equipped teachers facilitate long-term success and improvements in the education system, especially when it comes to managing disruptive behavior more effectively. 4. A focus on inclusivity: Schools must focus on providing an inclusive learning environment, where every child is given the opportunity to thrive. Conclusion: The NCB's report on thousands of English children missing out on education is a stark reminder that even developed countries aren't exempt from educational challenges. It calls for immediate and decisive action to ensure that no child is left behind. By understanding the root causes and implementing effective solutions, it's possible to put an end to this educational crisis and secure a better future for these children and society as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Since 1827, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always simultaneously held the office of Second Lord of the Treasury when that person has not also been the Prime Minister. The official residence of the Second Lord of The Treasury is 11 Downing Street.  - Her Majesty's Government (HMG), commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  - Downing Street in London, United Kingdom, has for more than three hundred years housed the official residences of two of the most senior British Cabinet ministers: the First Lord of the Treasury, an office now synonymous with that of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; and the Second Lord of the Treasury, an office held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister's official residence is 10 Downing Street; the Chancellor's official residence is next door at Number 11. The government's Chief Whip has an official residence at Number 12, although the current Chief Whip's residence is at Number 9.  - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury. The office is a British Cabinet-level position.  - The Chief Whip is a political office in some legislatures whose task is to administer the whipping system that tries to ensure that members of the party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British politics, the Chief Whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street.  - The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the commission exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom, and is now always also the Prime Minister.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Article:The 61,000-capacity venue - due to open in 2018 - will feature a retractable grass pitch with an artificial surface underneath for NFL games. The stadium will be built adjacent to White Hart Lane - Spurs' current home. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the link-up with the NFL was a \\"compelling and exciting partnership\\". Tottenham will receive rent from the NFL - the world's richest sports league by revenue - for use of the stadium. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said the club \\"have an opportunity to deliver one of the most unique sports, leisure and entertainment venues in the world\\". But having reached a deal with the NFL, the north London club will need to meet a flexible stadium design complete with a pitch that disappears under the stands to reveal an artificial surface, and larger changing rooms as American football squads can exceed 60 players. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said his organisation \\"share a vision\\" with Tottenham, who are in discussions with the Football Association with the aim of playing at Wembley while the new stadium is being developed. In using Tottenham's stadium as a regular venue, the NFL knows it has a pitch which can withstand several matches in a short period and that it has access to facilities its franchises are used to back in the US. The move could also boost the chances of making London home to a permanent NFL franchise. The National Football League is keen to grow its fan base in the UK and has been pleased with the way its 'International Series' fixtures at Wembley - played there since 2007 - have been received by fans. All but one of those fixtures sold out and the Jacksonville Jaguars franchise agreed a deal with Wembley Stadium to play one fixture a season at the home of English football, between 2013 and 2016. \\"I'm not sure this deal brings a London franchise closer in itself, but the more games we play the more fans we create and that's what takes the discussion over a franchise on another step,\\" said David Tossell, Director of Public Affairs in Europe for the NFL. Wembley Stadium was quick to issue a statement after Tottenham's announcement, stating \\"we look forward to the NFL remaining part of this iconic venue's annual schedule\\". And the NFL is also intent on continuing to play matches at the venue, describing the arrangement with Spurs as \\"not exclusive\\". \\"When the deal with Wembley Stadium is up in 2016, we fully expect to continue playing games there,\\" added Tossell. Levy is keen for the new stadium to have a wide and positive impact on the London borough of Haringey and said the \\"hub\\" being built will create jobs. The \\"hub\\" includes new homes, a hotel and tourist attractions. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: \\"Touchdowns in Tottenham can only add to our reputation as a global sporting powerhouse and help us take another step towards our goal of having a permanent NFL franchise in London.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The new 61,000-capacity stadium in Tottenham, set to open in 2018, will feature a retractable grass pitch with an artificial surface underneath for NFL games.

Although violence between drug cartels has been occurring long before the war began, the government used its police forces in the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century with little effect. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected Mexican President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to put an end to drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against cartel operations, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now well over 25,000 troops involved. During the Felipe Calderón, the Mexican government has spent approximately US7 billion in an 18-month-old campaign against drug cartels. It is estimated that during 2006, there were about 2,000 drug-related violent deaths, about 2,300 deaths during 2007, and more than 6,200 people by the end of 2008.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones? is inside the article: William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones is Etty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever.

Answer:","output":"Theresa Michalak, born on May 7th, 1993, is a notable figure in the world of swimming. She was born in Halle an der Saale, a city in the southern part of the German state Saxony-Anhalt, known for its rich history, culture, and arts. Early in her life, Michalak demonstrated a natural affinity towards water sports, particularly swimming. She sharpened her swimming skills and techniques to master the Medley and Freestyle, two challenging yet popular forms of competitive swimming. Medley is a combination of four different swimming styles - butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle - swum in that order in one race. On the other hand, freestyle swimming, often interpreted as the fastest swimming stroke, provides the swimmer with the flexibility to use any means to get to the finish line. Theresa Michalak's proficiency in these two strokes set her apart from many other athletes in the field. Her skill and talent did not go unnoticed. She would soon join SV Halle, an elite sports club. SV Halle is well-known for nurturing talents and providing a conducive environment for athletes to flourish in various sports. Being a part of SV Halle played a pivotal role in shaping her swimming career, providing her with high-quality training and exposure at both national and international platforms. Her weight of 65 kilograms and a height of 1.75 meters played in her favor. While the weight contributed towards her strength, her height provided her with an extended reach, both of which are critical factors in competitive swimming. The turning point in Theresa Michalak's career was when she got an opportunity to swim for the University of Florida in the United States. Known for its sports culture, the University of Florida is home to many renowned athletes worldwide and has been a training ground for many Olympic athletes. At the University of Florida, Michalak honed her swimming skills further under top coaches' skilled guidance and alongside fellow talented swimmers. Here, she also got a chance to compete against some of the best swimmers at collegiate swim meets, strengthening her competitive spirit and performance under pressure. In short, Theresa Michalak’s life has been dominated by her swimming career. Born in the small city of Halle an der Saale in Germany, her journey has taken her to some of the most prestigious swimming competitions on the international stage. Her dedication, determination, along with her physical attributes, continue to propel her towards greater heights in the competitive world of swimming. Despite the triumphs and medals, she stays grounded to her roots, remembering the city and club where it all began. Her story serves as an inspiration for aspiring swimmers worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: The author's blood was not drained after the first five days in the hospital for how long? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"b). forty eight to fifty four hours."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which country uses fewer non-renewable resources?  Us and Canada are two friendly countries. Canada uses alternative methods to produce electricity while the US use more coal and oil. Both countries recently participated in a Global Warming Council.  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Canada uses fewer non-renewable resources compared to the United States. The paragraph mentions that Canada uses alternative methods to produce electricity, which implies a stronger reliance on renewable energy sources. On the other hand, the United States uses more coal and oil, which are non-renewable resources, for its electricity production. The paragraph also highlights the negative impacts of using fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which include air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Additionally, it emphasizes the limited nature of both fossil fuels and radioactive elements, potentially leading to their depletion in the future. Although nuclear fission is mentioned as a source of energy that doesn't release air pollution or cause the mentioned environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels, it is not specified whether nuclear fission is being used as an energy source in either country. Nevertheless, the overall focus of the paragraph is on the difference in energy production methods between the two countries, with the United States utilizing more non-renewable resources and Canada employing alternative methods. In conclusion, Canada can be identified as the country that uses fewer non-renewable resources when compared to the United States, based on the information provided in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On August 11 , 2005 , Yoshinobu became Shimamura following the resignation of Iwanaga Agriculture Minister .","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing. Here's a breakdown and analysis of both sentences: Sentence 1: “On August 11, 2005, Yoshinobu Shimamura became Minister of Agriculture following the resignation of Iwanaga.” In this sentence, the key pieces of information are: - The date is August 11, 2005 - Yoshinobu Shimamura is the person in focus - Yoshinobu Shimamura takes on the position of Minister of Agriculture - The reason for his appointment to the position is because of the resignation of someone with the last name Iwanaga. The first sentence clearly states that Yoshinobu Shimamura assumed the position of Minister of Agriculture after the previous Minister, Iwanaga, resigned. Sentence 2: “On August 11, 2005, Yoshinobu became Shimamura following the resignation of Iwanaga Agriculture Minister.” In this sentence, the key pieces of information appear to be: - The date is August 11, 2005 - Yoshinobu is the person in focus, but there is ambiguity in the name (it seems that the last name has been separated) - There is a resignation of someone named Iwanaga, who is also referred to as the Agriculture Minister - An unclear event happens to Yoshinobu as they \\"became Shimamura.\\" The grammatical structure of the second sentence is confusing and leads to ambiguity. It seems like the sentence wants to express a similar idea as the first one but is not successful in doing so. The major issues are the separation of the name \\"Yoshinobu Shimamura\\" and the unclear relation between \\"Yoshinobu\\" and \\"became Shimamura.\\" It is important to structure sentences correctly to clearly convey intended meaning, as exemplified by the first sentence.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? The worst ever..  Wasted my money","output":"To describe the sentiment of this review, it can be classified as overwhelmingly negative. The author explicitly states their disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product or service they purchased. There are several reasons that contribute to the negative sentiment of this review, including: 1. Strong negative language: The use of words like \\"worst ever\\" and \\"wasted\\" evoke a sense of extreme dissatisfaction. The word \\"worst\\" particularly indicates that the experience was not only bad but probably the most terrible one they've had in comparison to other similar experiences. Furthermore, the use of the ellipsis following \\"worst ever\\" serves as an emphasis, reiterating the extreme unhappiness that the reviewer felt. 2. Monetary concerns: The mention of wasted money signifies that the reviewer believes the product or service did not deliver the value they expected in exchange for their monetary investment. This notion of waste is a strong driver of negative sentiment, as the reviewer likely feels that they have lost resources due to their interaction with the product or service. 3. Lack of positive language or statements: There are no indications of any positive experiences or aspects associated with the product or service. The absence of any contrasting or positive statements serves to solidify the sentiment as negative. If the reviewer had shared even minor positive comments, the sentiment might have been more mixed or nuanced. In sum, the sentiment of this review can be characterized as decidedly negative due to the strong unfavorable language employed, the emphasis on wasted resources, and the lack of any positive remarks. Anyone reading this review would likely infer that the reviewer does not recommend the product or service and is advising potential consumers to avoid it so that they do not experience a similar level of disappointment and frustration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.

Options: - school - business interviews - resort - michigan - city  The answer is \\"city\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"city\\" because skyscrapers are tall, multi-story buildings that are typically found in urban environments with a high concentration of businesses, residential spaces, and other facilities. These modern architectural marvels have become iconic symbols of economic power and status, and as such, they often serve as focal points for major cities around the world. In a school environment, one might expect to find classrooms, lecture halls, and other educational facilities; however, these spaces typically don't require the soaring height or density that is a hallmark of skyscrapers. Furthermore, schools are typically spread out in smaller buildings and prioritize open spaces like playgrounds and sports fields over the compact, vertical design of a skyscraper. In the context of business interviews, while some may indeed take place within the offices of a skyscraper, this option doesn't represent the type of area you would be in if you saw skyscrapers from your hotel room window. Business interviews, by their nature, are events or interactions rather than a distinct geographic location. As for resorts, these are typically in more scenic or leisure-focused environments such as beaches, mountains, or amusement parks, and are designed to provide a relaxing getaway for guests. While it's not impossible for a resort to be located within a city, the presence of skyscrapers indicates that the area is primarily focused on high-density urban living and commerce, rather than leisure and relaxation. The mention of \\"Michigan\\" as an option is somewhat curious; while it is a US state known for its beautiful lakes and nature, it is not inherently tied to or representative of skyscrapers or urban development. However, Michigan does have cities, such as Detroit, that do contain skyscrapers, but the mere presence of such buildings would not necessarily indicate that you are specifically in Michigan. Considering these points, the only option remaining that would best describe the type of area where one might see skyscrapers outside the window of a hotel room is a city.

While the initial statement leaves room for the idea that an activity could grow into a hobby, the second statement is quite the opposite, asserting that it will never happen. So, the statement \\"That will never become a hobby\\" does not follow from the statement \\"I mean that could become a hobby\\" since the former negates the possibility that was implied in the latter. The two statements express contrasting ideas, and it's important to recognize that potential and definitiveness are two different concepts in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Frank's parcel is a pine forest, while Brad's is a nice dry grassland with wild flowers and  a few shrubs.  Which parcel has thinner hummus layers?  Hint: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Answer:","output":"Based on the given hint, the parcel with thinner humus layers would be Brad's parcel, which is a dry grassland with wildflowers and a few shrubs. This is because the soil is better developed in the forest (Frank's parcel) with thick humus layers, resulting from the podzolization process and the rich diversity of large trees and animals living there."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Questions are crucial to any online (or in-person) chat, as they allow both partners to participate evenly and will keep the conversation interesting. Avoid overly serious (or sexual) questions, and instead ask questions that focus on her interests. To continue the chat, ask questions like:  “What kind of music do you listen to most often?” “What’s your favorite movie quote to use in conversation?” “What’s your favorite restaurant to order take-out from?” If you’ve matched with a girl on a dating app or website (like Tinder or Plenty of Fish) and are interested in maintaining a conversation, keep things light and fun. At least for the early stage of a chat conversation, avoid bringing up politics, religion, or any philosophical beliefs you may hold. If you start out with long, serious questions or statements, the chat will quickly become unpleasant and slow-paced for both you and the girl you’re talking with. Chatting with a girl online will allow you to communicate in ways that talking face-to-face won’t. Take advantage of the ability to send multimedia (audio, photos, videos, etc.) to each other, and use this to enhance or continue the conversation.  Send a funny video or GIF and ask the girl if she’s seen it before. Then, ask the girl to send you one of her favorite funny GIFs or short videos. Agree to answer a few of each other’s questions using only memes. If you’d like to talk with this girl again, end your current chat in a way that can lead to future conversation. Pick up on cues from the conversation(s) you’ve already had, and make it clear that you’d like to talk about a certain topic again. Or, if you don’t hear back from this girl within a week or so, you can use a topic as a conversation opener for the next chat.  For example, if she mentioned that she has an upcoming exam, you could say, “Let me know if you survive that test!” Or, if she’s mentioned that she’s planning to watch a movie or TV show, try saying: “Tell me what you think of the show once you’ve watched it.” What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to have a good and interesting chat with a girl online. It suggests asking light and fun questions, avoiding serious topics in the early stage of conversation, and using multimedia like funny videos or GIFs to keep the conversation enjoyable.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.\\",  answer the following question.

The answer to the question: Who makes up a fake description of the assailant? is inside the article: Johnny English is a kindhearted but inept MI7 secret agent with dreams of being their most trusted employee. After Agent One dies in a submarine accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are assassinated via a bombing at Agent One's funeral, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing the mission Agent One left when he died.  English is assigned to thwart a plot to steal the Crown Jewels, which are on display at the Tower of London. During the display, the power suddenly suffers a blackout and the jewels are stolen. During the chaos, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an assailant to make up for his mistakes. He later makes up a false description of the \\"assailant\\" to MI7 head Pegasus. English and his assistant Angus Bough find that the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. The two follow a tunnel where they confront the two thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a hearse, with English trying to pursue them but he mistakes another hearse for the escaped vehicle to which he accidentally gatecrashes a funeral until Bough comes to his aid by pretending English is an escaped mental patient. English connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the Crown Jewels. Pegasus finds the claims of his involvement absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Lorna in a sushi restaurant as he recognized her pink motorcycle. During their meeting, English is suspicious of her since he has seen her at two of their crime scenes and her records cannot be found on any government computer. English and Bough then decide to break into Sauvage's headquarters via parachutes, but English mistakenly lands on a visually identical tower which turns out to be the City Hospital., can you guess it ?","output":"Based on the content of the provided article, the person who makes up a false description of the assailant is the protagonist, Johnny English.  Looking at the text, specifically the part which states, \\"During the chaos, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an assailant to make up for his mistakes.

Read this article and answer this question In 1592, during the war with Spain, an English fleet had captured a large Portuguese galleon off the Azores, the Madre de Deus, loaded with 900 tons of merchandise from India and China, worth an estimated half a million pounds . This foretaste of the riches of the East galvanized interest in the region.  That same year, Dutch merchants sent Cornelis de Houtman to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the Spice Islands. In 1595, merchant and explorer Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, having traveled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the \\"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\\" . The published report included vast directions on how to navigate ships between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. Dutch and British interest fed on new information led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of the English East India Company, in 1600, and Dutch East India Company , in 1602, allowing the entry of chartered companies in the so-called East Indies. In 1602, the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie  was founded, with the goal of sharing the costs of the exploration of the East Indies and ultimately re-establishing the spice trade, a vital source of income to the new Republic of the Seven United Provinces.

And this is a town that everybody agrees, law enforcement, Border Patrol, residents on both sides, is a staging area of illegal drugs and illegal aliens. Can we infer the following? The town is a gathering place for illegal aliens and drugs","output":"Yes, based on the given information, we can infer that the town is a gathering place for illegal aliens and illegal drugs. The statement mentions that everyone – including law enforcement, Border Patrol, and residents on both sides – agree that the town serves as a staging area for these illicit activities. Let us break down what this implies. First, a \\"staging area\\" typically refers to a location where people or materials are assembled and organized before moving on to their final destinations. In this case, the statement suggests that illegal aliens and drugs are gathered and prepared in the town before they proceed to other locations. This could mean that people involved in human and drug smuggling use the town as a strategic point to regroup, plan, and coordinate their next moves. Second, the fact that different groups of people (law enforcement, Border Patrol, and local residents) agree on this issue indicates that the town's association with illegal activities is likely a well-known and widely acknowledged reality. It could also suggest that these illicit activities have become a significant concern for the community, affecting their daily lives and possibly making it difficult to address and curb the problem. Furthermore, the mention of \\"residents on both sides\\" could imply that the town is located near a border, possibly separating two countries. This would make it a particularly convenient location for illegal cross-border activities to take place. Given that law enforcement and Border Patrol are involved, it appears that these smuggling activities may be happening across a heavily monitored or guarded border, making the success of these operations even more concerning. In summary, the statement allows us to infer that the town is a gathering place for illegal aliens and drugs. It seems to be a well-known hub for people involved in these activities to converge, plan, and prepare before moving on to their final destinations. The shared concern and agreement among law enforcement, Border Patrol, and local residents further underscore the severity of the issue and suggest that this problem is both significant and challenging to address."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the question provided does not explicitly mention a specific year or event tied to Aldan's inception, some context can be derived from the information about the Aldansky District. Aldansky District sits in the south of the Sakha Republic, along the right bank of the Lena River and near the mouth of the Aldan River. Its administrative center is the town of Aldan. As of the 2010 Census, the total population of the district was 42,632, with the town of Aldan accounting for 49.9% of that number. The fact that Aldan is a gold-mining town implies that its inception is closely related to the discovery and exploitation of gold deposits in the region, which would have eventually led to the establishment of the town to support the growing industry. Gold mining has a long history in Russia, dating back to the early 18th century, when Peter the Great initiated the Siberian gold rush by ordering expeditions to search for gold in the eastern and central parts of the country. The increasing demand for gold and the development of more sophisticated mining techniques throughout the centuries contributed to the persistence and growth of the gold-mining industry in Russia. Given this historical context, it is reasonable to assume that Aldan's inception as a town and administrative center in the Aldansky District is related to its significance in the gold-mining industry, although an exact inception date or event has not been provided in the information available."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Applause can occur spontaneously or be prompted by cues from the performer or speaker. In some instances, it may also be used to drown out interruptions or dissenting voices during an event. Beyond clapping hands, people have employed different forms of applause throughout history, such as stomping feet, whistling, or cheering. In certain cultures, specific gestures or rituals are performed as an alternative to clapping, like the Japanese \\"rhythmic clapping\\" or the Native American \\"stomp dance.\\" In conclusion, \\"(Aplauze)\\" is a Romanian word that translates to \\"Applause\\" in English, a gesture performed by audiences to express admiration, approval, or appreciation for performances and speakers.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which region had fewer species inhabiting it?  Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.

At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Riki Michele (born Michele Bunch, currently Michele Palmer) is a female Christian alternative music artist. She was a singer for Adam Again, and has also recorded four eclectic solo records.  - Christian alternative rock is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic, though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.  - Ed McTaggart (born July 10, 1951) is an American drummer and artist. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Daniel Amos.  - Christian rock is a form of rock music that promotes Jesus and is typically performed by self-proclaimed Christian individuals and bands whose members focus the lyrics on matters of Christian faith. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - The 77s (alternatively spelled The Seventy Sevens or The 77's) are an American rock band consisting of Michael Roe on vocals/guitar, Mark Harmon on bass and Bruce Spencer on drums.  - Jeffrey Lynne (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer who gained fame in the 1970s as the lead singer and sole constant member of Electric Light Orchestra. In 1988, under the pseudonyms Otis Wilbury and Clayton Wilbury, he co-founded the supergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.  - Greg Flesch (born 1960) is a guitarist and musician, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as Gene Pool).  - Derri Daugherty (born October 13, 1958) is an American record producer, songwriter, guitarist and singer, best known as the lead singer and guitarist for band The Choir.  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - Jerry Chamberlain is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as \\"Spot\\").  - Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936  December 6, 1988), nicknamed the Big O, was an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his distinctive, impassioned voice, complex compositions and dark emotional ballads. The combination led many critics to describe his music as operatic, giving him the sobriquet \\"the Caruso of Rock\\". Between 1960 and 1964, 22 of his songs placed on the \\"Billboard\\" Top 40, including \\"Only the Lonely\\" (1960), \\"Crying\\" (1961), and \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" (1964).  - Scenic Routes is an album by roots music band Lost Dogs, released on BAI Records in 1992.

However, they are not intended to limit or interfere with duly granted authority related to developing legislation, rule-making, or other discretionary policy-making in an agency. Does it follow that \\"They were really slye about interfering though. \\"?","output":"The original statement discusses the intention of not limiting or interfering with the granted authority in the context of legislative development, rule-making, or discretionary policy-making within an agency. However, there appears to be a concern or suggestion that there might be interference happening in a cunning or subtle manner in the latter part of the statement, \\"They were really slye about interfering though.\\" To fully address this question, it is vital to analyze the nature of the alleged interference and its effects on the overall functioning of the concerned agency. The term \\"slye\\" indicates a sense of sneakiness or deceit, suggesting that the actions causing the interference may be covert in nature and difficult to detect. To analyze the situation, several areas need to be considered: 1. Legal Framework: It is essential to evaluate existing laws, policies, and regulations governing the agency's functioning. These rules would typically define the boundaries within which interference occurs and help identify if any such interfering activities are truly taking place. It is crucial to determine whether any actions that deviate from the established norms are legally authorized or not. 2. Stakeholders: Interference could arise from multiple sources, both internal and external to the agency. It is crucial to analyze the stakeholders involved in the decision-making processes, their motivations, and interests. This would help establish any conflicts of interest or ulterior motives that could be contributing to the alleged interference. 3. Impact on Functions: To prove interference, one must determine whether the sly actions have had any discernable effect on the legislative, rule-making, or policy-making capabilities of the agency. If such a negative impact can be demonstrated, it lends credence to the claim of interference. It would be vital to evaluate the outcomes of the concerned agency’s programs, projects, or policies and how they deviate from their original purpose due to interference. 4. Accountability and Oversight: A key factor in identifying and remedying potential interference in an agency's operations is having a robust system of accountability and oversight. This includes transparency, regular audits, and balanced decision-making authority to avoid centralized control. It is vital that the agency concerned adheres to these principles to minimize the chances of interference going unnoticed. 5. Remedial Measures: If it is evident that there is sly interference occurring, appropriate remedial measures should be taken to address the situation. This may involve reshuffling or restructuring the agency's decision-making authority, revisiting policies and procedures, or even seeking legal redress. In conclusion, while the statement, \\"They were really slye about interfering though,\\" raises concerns about potential interference in an agency's legislative or policy-making processes, a thorough investigation into the aspects mentioned above is necessary to substantiate these claims. By evaluating the legal framework, stakeholders, impacts on functions, accountability, and oversight systems in place, any possible interference may be detected, and appropriate remedial measures can be undertaken to safeguard the agency's mandate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.  - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin \\"natrium\\") and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged atomthe Na cation. Its only stable isotope is Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.  - The alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column (group) 2 of the Periodic table. They are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). They have very similar properties: they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl. It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word \\"chloride\\" may also form part of the \\"common\\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent CCl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.  - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Hijiki (  ,  or  hijiki ) ( Sargassum fusiforme , syn . Hizikia fusiformis ) is a brown sea vegetable growing wild on rocky coastlines around Japan , Korea , and China . Hijiki has been a part of the Japanese diet for centuries . Hijiki is rich in dietary fibre and essential minerals such as calcium , iron , and magnesium .

Translate this to English?","output":"This is another one of the issues that have emerged during this discussion. Are the same strict measures applied in cases where France, Germany, or Italy, whose deficits are approaching or have already exceeded three percent, deviate from this discipline? In this discussion, the concern is raised about whether the same strict measures and financial discipline will be applied to countries like France, Germany, or Italy if their deficits approach or exceed the three-percent threshold. The importance of maintaining fiscal discipline is a key aspect of ensuring the stability of a region's economy, particularly within the European Union, where the member states agree to adhere to certain financial rules and standards for the benefit of the entire union.  In the case of France, Germany, or Italy, each country has unique economic circumstances that may contribute to their deficits. Factors such as economic growth, government spending, and existing debt levels can all impact their ability to maintain fiscal discipline. It is essential for the European Union to consider these factors when assessing whether strict measures need to be enforced for these nations. The Stability and Growth Pact, an agreement among EU member states, sets a limit on the budget deficits of its members to prevent excessive spending, with a requirement for countries to maintain a deficit below three percent of their GDP. However, if a country's deficit exceeds this threshold, the EU can impose strict measures, such as fines or other disciplinary actions, to enforce budgetary discipline.  In practice, the enforcement of these measures is not always consistent, as the EU has been known to grant exceptions or extensions to countries that struggle to meet the required fiscal discipline. This can be seen in the case of France, which has received leniency from the EU in the past regarding its budget deficit.  However, it is crucial for the EU to maintain a balance between accommodating the unique economic circumstances of individual member states and enforcing fiscal discipline for the well-being of the entire union. As such, it is likely that the EU will continue to closely monitor the economic performance of France, Germany, and Italy and take necessary actions to ensure their adherence to the established fiscal discipline guidelines whenever needed. In conclusion, while the same strict measures are technically applicable to all EU member states, including France, Germany, and Italy, the actual enforcement of these measures depends on the specific economic conditions each country faces. The EU must strike a balance between maintaining fiscal discipline and accommodating the unique circumstances of individual countries, ensuring the overall stability and growth of the European Union as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[-] yes [-] it is not possible to tell [-] no Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, but it can be inferred from the context in which the sentences appear and the information provided. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence and examine their relationship. Sentence 1: \\"They don't want to discourage me altogether.\\" This sentence suggests that there is an intention on the part of the individuals being referred to (\\"They\\") to avoid causing the subject (in this case, \\"me\\") to feel utterly disheartened or demotivated. The use of the word \\"altogether\\" implies a sense of complete discouragement that they are trying to avoid. Sentence 2: \\"They want me to have some hope and not give up entirely.\\" This sentence provides more insight into the individuals' intentions, stating that they have a desire to maintain some level of hope within the subject. The mention of \\"not give up entirely\\" further emphasizes the idea that they are attempting to avoid a total loss of motivation or determination on the part of the subject. While the first sentence mainly focuses on the individuals' intent to prevent complete discouragement, the second sentence emphasizes their purpose in preserving some sense of hope within the subject. Although both sentences share a common goal of maintaining the subject's motivation, the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first one. However, when providing a straightforward answer to the question, the closest option would be \\"yes,\\" as the sentences do share similarities in terms of their ultimate goal for the subject, and the information provided in the second sentence can be construed as an extension of the implications found in the first sentence. It is important to note, though, that this connection is not an explicit entailment but rather an inferred relationship based on the context and meaning of the sentences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Andrew Cuomo on Friday declared a state of emergency in every county in expectation of the storm, while placing the National Guard on standby. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city's Metropolitan Transportation Authority would begin suspending service \\"before the arrival of sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher.\\" \\"A major concern given this type of storm is the possibility of prolonged power outages, as you know,\\" he said. As Sandy churned northward, forecasters warned of high winds, strong tides and heavy rain, as well as potential snow, saying the storm would be strengthened by its collision with a wintry storm moving from the west. Early forecasting models show the tropical weather could make landfall in the Washington region as early as Monday, though it will more likely push farther north and slam the New York metropolitan area by Tuesday. Eastern portions of Ohio and Pennsylvania could get snow, while heavy rains are expected to blast the Eastern Seaboard. In Maryland, Gov. Martin O'Malley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm. \\"I urge all Marylanders to review their family emergency plans, make sure their emergency supplies like batteries and water are fully stocked and to stay informed,\\" he said. Meanwhile in Connecticut, Avon Town Manager Brandon Robertson recalled the perils of last year's storm, which knocked out 90% of the town's power grid around Halloween. \\"The town was in pretty tough shape,\\" he said. \\"I don't think anyone expected the level of devastation.\\" Robertson said he had his first emergency preparedness meeting Friday and that power companies, which were criticized for a slow response last year, have already started to prepare. \\"We are stronger and better prepared to respond now,\\" said Connecticut Light & Power spokeswoman Theresa Gilbert. Federal authorities warned those in the densely populated area that is the storm's predicted path to fill up on prescriptions, nonperishable foods, cash, bottled water, flashlights, extra batteries and first-aid kits. Farther south, Virginia's National Guard was authorized Friday to bring up to 300 personnel for possible recovery operations. Last year, Hurricane Irene inflicted major damage from North Carolina to New England, though largely spared New York, where Manhattan restaurants and bars hosted hurricane specials and parties. But in neighboring states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the storm had harsher effects, knocking out power for thousands and causing flooding. \\"While Sandy's exact track is still uncertain, New Jersey has the potential to experience a major impact from high winds, heavy rain, flooding and power outages,\\" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \\"I encourage all of our families to stay informed, get ready and reach out to those you know who may be isolated or in need of extra assistance during adverse conditions.\\" Floods are considered the most frequent natural hazards in New Jersey and residents across Atlantic County could be seen Friday filling up sandbags in preparation. Meanwhile, utility companies across the region were also in preparation mode in the hopes of reducing the numbers of power outages brought on by a rush of inclement weather. \\"We're bringing in all of our field people,\\" said Rena Esposito, a spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas Company, New Jersey's largest utility firm. \\"We're also making arrangements with other utility companies to be able to get support from other states if needed.\\" Last October, a powerful snowstorm left more than a million residents without power across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Please answer the following question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” The author probably believes that what would probably help prevent burnout? - Working longer hours - Achieving financial success - Taking a vacation from work once in a while - not enough information Answer:","output":"The author would likely believe that taking a vacation from work once in a while would probably help prevent burnout. This view aligns with the topic of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness, which the text centers around.  In the text, a clear distinction is made between the pursuit of high levels of professional and financial success at any cost and the importance of living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences. It is pointed out that despite the expected peace and happiness, relentless pursuit of success has often not produced the anticipated satisfaction but has instead resulted in professional burnout from chronic stress.  Chronic stress, described as a relentless stress that pounds the mind and body leaving no time for recovery, leads to burnout characterized by the inability of the individual to function effectively on both a personal and professional level. Psychology Today pointed out that high-achievers, who often have \\"I can do everything\\" personalities, are at risk of burnout. This implies that there needs to be a balance with periods of rest or recovery to avoid depleting resources and prevent burnout.  Therefore, in the context of this text, it can be inferred that the author would likely agree with taking a vacation from work once in a while. This is because doing so can serve as a period of rest, recovery, and varied experience that would help to relieve cumulative stress and potentially avert professional burnout. It's important to note, taking a vacation doesn't necessarily mean an extravagant trip; it could simply be taking time away from work to relax and engage in other enjoyable activities, thereby promoting a balanced life, which is the central theme of discussion in the text.    Working longer hours and achieving financial success are counterproductive in the context of this question; the text criticizes these as the causes of an unbalanced life that leads to professional burnout. The option \\"not enough information\\" is not suitable, given that the text provides ample context to discern the author's probable beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Individual astronomers recognize several of these, and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects, ranging from \\"nearly certain\\" to \\"possible\\" dwarf planets.' Question: what makes a dwarf planet The answer to this question is:","output":"A dwarf planet is a celestial object that orbits the Sun and has certain specific characteristics. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization responsible for classifying celestial bodies, a dwarf planet must meet the following criteria: 1. It must be in orbit around the Sun: A dwarf planet orbits the Sun, similar to a planet, but it is not considered a natural satellite like a moon. 2. It must have sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces, resulting in a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape: This means a dwarf planet has enough gravity to have a nearly round shape and maintain that shape despite other external forces. It is not completely rigid-like a solid body but has a balance of forces and mass distribution that allows it to maintain its shape. 3. It has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit: This is the primary criterion that differentiates a dwarf planet from a full-fledged planet. When celestial bodies form, they gather material around their orbits from a process called \\"clearing the neighborhood.\\" Planets have cleared their orbits of other debris, but dwarf planets have not and share their orbits with other objects. 4. It is not a satellite of another body: A dwarf planet cannot be a moon or natural satellite orbiting another celestial object. It must have its own independent orbit around the Sun. Examples of dwarf planets include Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. Other celestial objects have been proposed as dwarf planets, but their status remains uncertain and requires further observation and study. Some scientists predict that there may be more undiscovered dwarf planets within our Solar System and beyond. Why does the classification matter? Defining what a dwarf planet is helps astronomers understand the broader structure and evolution of the Solar System. By observing these objects' characteristics and the way they interact within their orbits, scientists can gather more information about how these celestial bodies formed and how they have evolved over time. This distinction also helps prevent confusion when discussing and comparing celestial bodies as it provides a standardized framework to recognize and categorize objects in the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide on the rules, the day it'll start, who you want to participate, the time the competition will take place on, and (optional) the prizes.  Send out invitations.","output":"The most logical next event after sending out invitations for a cupcake baking competition at your house is the organization and execution of the competition itself. Here are some essential steps and ideas to successfully host the event: 1. Preparation of materials and ingredients: Once you have confirmed the participants' attendance, create a list of required ingredients and materials necessary for cupcake baking. These may include ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, butter, baking powder, milk, and a variety of flavors and toppings. Additionally, make sure to have enough mixing bowls, measuring cups, spoons, cupcake liners, baking trays, and an oven to accommodate all participants. 2. Setting up the venue: Ensure that your kitchen or the designated baking area has ample space and is well-ventilated for all participants to comfortably bake. Arrange separate workstations with necessary tools and ingredients for each participant, keeping enough distance between them to avoid any disturbances while baking. 3. Establishing the judging criteria: Determine the criteria by which the cupcakes will be judged. This can include taste, presentation, creativity, and originality. It's essential to communicate these criteria to the participants beforehand so they can prepare accordingly. You may also consider inviting a panel of judges who have a strong background in baking or culinary arts to evaluate the cupcakes impartially. 4. Providing a timeline: Assign a fixed amount of time for the competition, including the preparation, baking, and decoration of cupcakes. Communicate this information clearly to all participants, allowing them to manage their time efficiently. 5. Managing the competition: Once the competition begins, act as the moderator and ensure that all participants adhere to the rules, the timeline, and maintain fairness throughout the event. Offer assistance if needed and keep track of the time. 6. Judging and announcing the winners: When the competition ends, gather all cupcakes for judging. Allow the judges (or yourself, if you are the only judge) to taste and evaluate each cupcake based on the established criteria. After deliberation, announce the winners and, if applicable, distribute the prizes. Make sure to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of all participants. 7. Cleanup: After the competition, ensure that the kitchen or baking area is cleaned up, with all utensils and supplies properly stored. It's always a good idea to have some helping hands to make the cleanup process more manageable. 8. Post-event follow-up: Consider sending out a thank you note to all participants and judges for their involvement in the competition, expressing your gratitude and appreciation for their time and effort. You can also share photos of the event or the winning cupcakes on your social media platforms, if desired. By following these steps, you can ensure a well-organized and enjoyable cupcake baking competition at your house, making it a memorable event for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What country's economy melted down in 2008 following the collapse of banks Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing?","output":"The country whose economy melted down in 2008 following the collapse of banks Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing is Iceland. This event, known as the 2008-2011 Icelandic financial crisis, was one of the most significant economic events in the country's history and had ripple effects on the global economy. The collapse of these banks was primarily brought about by overexpansion into risky investments and excessive borrowing in foreign markets during the first decade of the 2000s. Prior to the meltdown, Iceland had experienced a period of extraordinary economic growth, partly due to aggressive financial deregulation, cheap credit, and an influx of foreign investment. The value of the Icelandic krona had surged, property prices soared, and the country's global influence in finance had grown considerably. However, when the US subprime mortgage crisis unfolded in 2007 and global credit markets tightened, the Icelandic banks found themselves unable to refinance their enormous debt. The three largest banks—Glitnir, Landsbanki, and Kaupthing—had expanded so quickly and had taken on excessive risks and high levels of debt, that their combined assets swelled to more than ten times the country's GDP. With the banks unable to secure new financing, and global trust in Iceland's financial sector waning, the Icelandic government decided to nationalize Glitnir in September 2008, hoping that it would help stabilize the financial system. Unfortunately, this action was unsuccessful, and the credit rating of both other banks, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, plunged, causing their stocks to plummet, and exacerbating the situation. Eventually, all three banks went into receivership. The Icelandic financial crisis had a massive impact on the country's economy and its citizens. The value of the Icelandic krona plummeted, inflation skyrocketed, unemployment rose sharply, and thousands of people lost their savings in the process. The government implemented austerity measures and sought financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other countries to help stabilize the economy. The effects of the crisis were felt beyond Iceland, with many foreign investors and depositors in Icelandic banks experiencing significant losses. This led to a diplomatic dispute between Iceland, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, as they sought to recover the lost funds of their citizens who had deposited money in Icelandic banks. In the following years, Iceland made significant strides in rebuilding its economy and financial sector. The government imposed capital controls, took legal actions against several high-profile bankers, and implemented regulatory reforms in an effort to ensure a similar collapse would not happen again. By 2015, the country had managed to stabilize its economy and repay most of the emergency loans it had received during the crisis. While the Icelandic financial meltdown of 2008 remains a cautionary tale in modern economic history, it also serves as an example of how a country can recover from extreme financial adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It suggested the north-south divide is \\"wide as ever\\" and that salaries across the UK have fallen by £1,300 a year. The lack of affordable housing is putting pressure on workers in the South-East of England, it warned. In its annual report, Centre for Cities, highlights the link between low wages and the need to top up people's incomes with welfare benefits. It looked at the UK's 63 largest cities and found that there was a difference of £253 in average weekly incomes from the highest to the lowest paid. But the amount claimed in benefits was roughly the same across the cities covered by the report. Hull had the lowest weekly wage at £376, Blackburn was second at £404 and Blackpool was a little higher at £414. The leader of Hull City Council Stephen Brady said: \\"We understand the need to address and boost skills within knowledge intensive, digital and professional industries.\\" He said the city was seeing high levels of investment from the offshore wind industry and that being named UK City of Culture 2017 would help create new jobs in the region. The cities with the highest salaries were London at £629, Reading at £591, and Aldershot at £571. They also saw the fastest jobs growth. But in the areas where salaries were near the top of the scale, the high cost of housing meant many were still having to claim benefits. The report says the lack of affordable homes means the government's plans to reduce the welfare bill would be difficult to deliver. Only one in four places was delivering a \\"high wage, low welfare\\" economy, the report said. Alexandra Jones, chief executive of Centre for Cities said: \\"One of the most pressing issues is the need to tackle skills gaps and improve school attainment. As well as investment in infrastructure the top priority should be on addressing housing shortages.\\" On a more positive note the report shows that 14 UK cities have hit the target for \\"high-wage, low-welfare\\" economies.  It calls on the government to give local councils more power to invest in employment programmes, which if successful, would reduce their need for benefits.","output":"The Centre for Cities' annual report reveals a persistent north-south divide in the UK, as well as a decline in salaries nationwide by £1,300 per year.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: October Jobs Numbers Are Big News … for the Next President Presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney campaigns in Land O' Lakes, Fla., on Oct. 27, 2012. The U.S. economy added an estimated 171,000 jobs in October, according to a Nov. 2 government report, which also made upward revisions to August and September figures of some 84,000 previously unreported jobs. It’s the second straight month with large positive revisions, erasing concerns prevalent in August that the lumbering recovery had ground to a halt. This is potentially big news for presidential politics. But not in the way you might think. Don’t be fooled by Democratic backslapping or ludicrous Republican spin. (Conservatives are eagerly pointing out that the 7.9% unemployment rate is a tenth of a percentage point higher than the day Obama took office in 2009. Employment fell off a cliff shortly thereafter, and the reason the rate ticked up in October was that Americans were rejoining the workforce — all-around good news.) The October report won’t have any real effect on the outcome of the presidential election Nov. 6. To reiterate what we’ve written before, economic news takes some time to sink in with the electorate. No one’s going to print out the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics Excel spreadsheet to bring with them into the voting booth. The reality is that the economic news from the past six months — a frustratingly slow recovery but a recovery all the same — is already baked into President Obama’s numbers. Just as Republicans can’t credibly claim most voters will hold Obama responsible for catastrophic losses at the beginning of his term — and in fact most polls still show more voters blame President Bush for the economy’s woes — Democrats can’t credibly claim the upward revisions announced Nov. 2 will improve most voters’ impressions of Obama’s handling of the economy before Election Day. But the increasingly positive trajectory is politically important all the same. As Derek Thompson points out at the Atlantic, “Whoever wins on Tuesday inherits an economy that is still awfully weak and a jobs recovery that’s clearly gaining momentum.” To put it another way, the next President will preside over an economy with a large capacity for job growth in the next four years. Mitt Romney was shrewd enough to recognize this fact early on and has focused his closing pitch around a pledge to create 12 million jobs in his first term. This is deviously brilliant — and a little dishonest — because that’s on the conservative end of what nonpartisan economic forecasters expect to happen under current policies. Obama, perhaps wizened by the painfully inaccurate consensus forecasts in the months before he took office, has not tried to take any credit for these projections by claiming that they’re due to his policies. Ultimately, monthly jobs reports are just surveys with fairly large margins for error. It’s always silly to make sweeping pronouncements about the state of the economy on the basis of any one metric in any given month. But historically there’s been a pattern to mistaken economic forecasts. In a recession, the eggheads tend to underestimate the depths of distress. Conservative estimates in bad times have turned out to be woefully wrong, as they were in late 2008. But the reverse is also true: large upward revisions to recent jobs reports suggest we might see more upward revisions to all sorts of economic figures in the coming months — a recovery with real momentum. Whoever wins on Nov. 6 will likely get the credit. And either way, you’ll hear a lot about it for the next four years. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Sure kiddo, let me break that big grown-up news into simple bits for you. 1. The US created more jobs: There were more jobs created in October, 171,000 in fact. This number also includes some jobs that were left uncounted from the months before. 2. Unemployment rose a bit: The percentage of people who don't have jobs went up by a tiny bit to 7.9%. But this isn't entirely bad news because it's because more people started looking for jobs again. 3. The news won't affect the election: Even though this is big news, it won't really change who people are voting for in the upcoming presidential election. Much like how we may not immediately notice when cookies are baking in the oven, it takes time for people to feel the effects of such news. 4. Things are still not perfect but looking better: The economy - think of like the money health of the country - is getting better slowly but surely, which is good news for whoever becomes the next president. 5. The promise of more jobs: Romney, one of the people running for president, has said if he wins, he'll make sure 12 million jobs are created. This actually aligns with what experts are predicting would happen anyway. 6. Expect more good news: Based on what's been happening, it's possible the number of jobs and other good things about the economy might get even better over the next few months. Whoever becomes president will likely get praised for this."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer the question...what's the tigers name in ice age??","output":"In the Ice Age franchise, the character you are referring to is named Diego. Diego is a saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon fatalis) who appears in the Ice Age films as one of the main characters. He is a member of the movie's central group, known as \\"The Herd,\\" which consists of various prehistoric animals that live together as a makeshift family. Initially, Diego is shown as a cunning, loyal, and skilled predator who serves as the lead tracker for his pack, led by the alpha saber-toothed tiger, Soto. Diego was assigned by Soto to bring back a human baby named Roshan, who Soto wanted as a part of his revenge against the humans for the loss of many pack members. Despite Diego's initial loyalty to his pack, he later develops a strong bond with the misfit characters––Manny, a woolly mammoth, and Sid, a ground sloth––and eventually decides to put their welfare and friendship ahead of his duty to the pack. As the storyline progresses, Diego undergoes significant character development. He evolves from a initially a fierce and calculating hunter to a loyal, dependable, and caring friend. Since the first movie, Diego's personality becomes more compassionate and less predatory. This in part demonstrates the power of friendship and unity among diverse creatures. Throughout the movie series, Diego's character faces many challenges and adventures with \\"The Herd.\\" His relationship with Manny, Sid, and other fellow herd members consistently deepens, showing that even the most unlikely groups can form meaningful friendships and families in the face of adversities.

What is the answer to this question? how much money did it cost to make oceans 8?","output":"Ocean's 8 is a 2018 American heist comedy film directed by Gary Ross and is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy. The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna, and Helena Bonham Carter. The story follows a group of women, led by Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock), who plan and execute a heist at the annual Met Gala in New York City. According to various sources, the estimated production budget for Ocean's 8 was approximately 70 million. This budget includes expenses such as the talent fees for the star-studded cast, location permits, set design, costumes, special effects, and post-production. It's worth noting that this budget does not encompass marketing and distribution costs, which can often be significant for a movie with such a high-profile cast and targeted towards a wide audience. Marketing materials such as posters, trailers, TV spots, and other promotional content all come with additional expenses. The film was a financial success, grossing over 297 million in worldwide box office revenue. The positive reception and commercial success of the film allowed it to recoup its production budget and cover its marketing costs, making it a profitable venture for Warner Bros., the studio behind Ocean's 8. In comparison, the other movies in the Ocean's franchise had varied production budgets. Ocean's Eleven (2001) had a budget of 85 million, Ocean's Twelve (2004) had a budget of 110 million, and Ocean's Thirteen (2007) had a budget of 85 million. The production budget for Ocean's 8 was notably lower than its predecessors, despite the inflation in costs over time. The lower budget could be attributed to the filmmakers' decision to prioritize story and character development over elaborate action sequences, as well as the change in the film's setting, which involved fewer casino and high-rolling atmospheres that were predominant in the earlier movies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","output":"To answer this question, let's first evaluate the given information and what it implies: Premise: Increased penetration of personal computing technology at the household level. Task: Determine whether this implies a sharp decline in the use of personal computing technology in households. Step 1: Understand the terms - Increased penetration: This suggests that personal computing technology is becoming more widely available and accessible to households. - Household level: This implies the technology is being used by families or individuals in their homes. - Personal computing technology: Examples include desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between increased penetration and the use of personal computing technology - If personal computing technology has higher penetration in households, it means that more households have access to and are using this technology. Step 3: Compare premise with the conclusion - The premise indicates that personal computing technology is becoming more prevalent in households, while the conclusion suggests a decline in its use within households. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: (C). no.

The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Context: While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland.  The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics.  In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting. Question: What happened to the Spice Girls after Forever?. Whats the answer?","output":"After they released the album \\"Forever,\\" the Spice Girls decided to take a break. They wanted to focus on their own lives and careers outside of the group. This break was called an \\"indefinite hiatus,\\" which means they didn't know when or if they would come back together as the Spice Girls. Even though they took this break, they didn't officially break up. Each member of the group started doing their own things like making their own music and acting in movies or television shows. Later on, they got together for some special performances and events, but they didn't make any more albums as the Spice Girls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's open conflict with U.S. President Barack Obama over his diplomacy with Iran has not only served a blow to the U.S.-Israeli relationship. It has also collapsed Israel's otherwise arguably successful Iran policy. Contrary to Israel's rhetoric, the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s. Obviously, Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for Israel. But that has not been Israel's primary concern. Rather, the fear has been that Washington would end up finding a compromise with Iran that on the one hand would close off any Iranian path to a bomb, but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in Israel's disfavor. The more","output":"logical completion of this news story would be: The more practical elements of Israel's policy on Iran have revolved around maintaining American support and pressure on Tehran, while simultaneously seeking to ensure that any eventual agreement does not elevate Iran's regional standing. However, with relations between the U.S. and Israel strained over Netanyahu's confrontational approach to Obama's diplomacy with Iran, it seems that Israel's worst fears are coming to pass. Under the current administration, the United States has pivoted towards a more balanced approach to dealing with Iran, speaking to the grievances of both sides while also recognizing a need to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. Consequently, Washington has been able to reach an agreement that addresses its concerns about Iran's nuclear program while also signaling a potential shift in the regional power dynamics. This may culminate in a more multipolar Middle East, with Iran as a key player alongside Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, each with their own interests and alliances. This development is understandably seen as a threat to Israel's strategic advantage in the region. In conclusion, Israel's handling of the Iran issue, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, has unexpectedly backfired due to the unintended consequences of its confrontation with the United States. As a result, Israel now faces a regional landscape that may very well become less favorable in the years to come due to the possibility of an empowered Iran engaging in the diplomatic sphere and consolidating its influence in the Middle East. For Israel, this outcome highlights the importance of finding a more nuanced diplomatic approach to maintain its strategic relationships and regional influence."},{"instruction":"Korzeniec Podkarpackie Voivodeship -  Korzeniec [kɔˈʐɛɲɛt͡s] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Bircza within Przemyśl County Subcarpathian Voivodeship in south-eastern Poland.

Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies.  I am facing a new situation today: A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: given a new species of animal is helpless at birth, it needs constant attention and care from a parent and is completely defensive, will this animal be categorized as precocial or altricial?

Tell me when you have it Lee: 👌 What were they talking about?","output":"From the discussion, it appears that Paul and Lee are referring to a particular movie that Paul wants Lee to purchase. Paul could have suggested a movie to Lee, probably a film that Paul enjoys or believes Lee would be interested in watching, and had previously sent Lee details about where to find or potentially how to buy the particular movie.  In this conversation, by \\"Hope you bought the movie I sent you\\", Paul is possibly referring to a link to an online platform, store details where physical DVDs are sold, or even a recommendation for a theater release that Lee should buy tickets for. When Lee responds, \\"Not yet. But I am headed there right now,\\" it can be inferred that they're planning to execute Paul's suggestion soon. The \\"there\\" in \\"I am headed there right now\\" can mean either a physical location, like a DVD store or a movie theater, where Lee's going to buy the movie, or a digital platform where Lee's going to buy or download the movie online.  After Paul says, \\"Okay. Tell me when you have it\\", it can be deduced that Paul is interested to know about Lee's acquisition of the movie. He could be excited about it for reasons such as anticipation of discussing the movie after Lee has watched it, or validating if his recommendation was was a good one. Finally, when Lee concludes with the emoji \\"👌\\", it communicates a positive reply of understanding or agreement, becoming synonymous with \\"okay\\" or \\"will do\\". In this context, it can be seen as Lee's assurance that they will notify Paul once the movie has been purchased.  Therefore, they were collectively talking about the acquisition of a particular movie that Paul recommended and sent information about to Lee. The conversation revolves around whether Lee has bought that movie yet, and when Lee will inform Paul of the purchase.

The new peace would only last for two years; war recommenced in the aftermath of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.[nb 5]","output":"Task: Read the passage and create a question based on the information provided.

Turkish gives a brief narration about the circumstances, then the movie really takes off. We then jump to Antwerp, where gangster and compulsive gambler Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his buddies, dressed like rabbis, pull off a daring robbery and nab an 86-karat diamond (throughout the rest of the film, it's either 86-karat or 84-karat, depending on which character states it, or it loses value after going through so many hands). One of Frankie's men is the brother of ex-KGB gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija), aka Boris the Bullet-Dodger, named due to his unique ability to defy death. Boris is now in the business of selling guns on the blackmarket, and lures Frankie to buy a gun, in order to steal the diamond.Meanwhile, Frankie has contacted jewelry retailer Doug the Head (Mike Reid) about the diamond. Doug lives in the Jewish community of London, although he himself is not even Jewish. Nevertheless, Doug contacts his Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) in New York about the diamond. Avi sounds very interested, and tells Doug to keep Frankie close and interested in selling.At the same time, Turkish and Tommy are preparing for a big bout, using their premier boxer, Gorgeous George. Tommy is being overprotective these days, and carries a small firearm that he bought from Boris the Blade. Turkish and Tommy run a legitimate slot machine business on the side, to compensate for the illegal boxing that they participate in, and their office is a run-down caravan. Turkish is unimpressed by doing deals in such a crappy environment, so he urges Tommy to go buy a new caravan from a traveling band of gypsies (or pikies, as everyone else calls them).

An electromagnetic system called \\"the tube\\" is used for travel from one city to another.\\" The envisioned society in this text appears to be highly advanced and efficient, with a variety of transportation methods designed to cater to the needs of both city-dwellers and inter-city travelers.  Within the cities, moving sidewalks are a convenient and effort-saving option for pedestrians, allowing them to cover distances without the need for walking. This would be particularly useful in busy commercial areas where a large number of people navigate through the streets. Moving sidewalks can potentially reduce traffic congestion and help maintain a smooth flow of movement for city residents. For shorter distances within the cities, a type of scooter is utilized. Scooters, in general, are compact, lightweight, and maneuverable, making them ideal for short trips or for navigating crowded areas. In this advanced society, it's likely that these scooters are either electric or powered by some other eco-friendly technology, contributing to the reduction of pollution and creating a more sustainable urban environment. But perhaps the most revolutionary mode of transportation described in the text is \\"the tube,\\" an electromagnetic system used for travel between cities. The tube system could be envisioned as a high-speed, efficient, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation, perhaps similar to the concept of Elon Musk's Hyperloop. With speeds reaching over 700 miles per hour, such a system would enable rapid and comfortable travel, drastically reducing commuting times and providing a solid alternative to traditional methods like air, road, or rail travel. In conclusion, this futuristic society has developed an impressive array of transportation options that support the efficient and eco-friendly movement of people within and between cities. The integration of moving sidewalks for pedestrians, scooters for shorter distances, and an electromagnetic tube system facilitating high-speed inter-city travel is an exciting concept that would contribute significantly to overall quality of life and drive progress in terms of sustainability and urban design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This could lead to a less disturbed environment with fewer disruptions for the caterpillar during its life cycle. Considering the process described (a larva is born - the caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - the caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - the caterpillar becomes a pupa - after some time the cocoon hatches - and a butterfly is born), the second effect mentioned is the caterpillar eating constantly until it grows bigger. Now, let's analyze the scenario where sediment is not picked up by wind or water and its potential impact on the second effect. The caterpillar would still need to eat constantly in order to grow bigger. As the environment with less sediment movement could be more stable and potentially cleaner, resources like food and shelter might be more readily available. In such conditions, the caterpillar might have better opportunities and fewer disturbances while hunting for food.

Article: Convenience  Foods Instead of buying only fresh foods, Americans nowadays buy many more convenience foods. These are foods which are ready partly or completely prepared. Many of them are frozen, such as frozen dinner, heat-and-serve French fries, and frozen pizzas. There are also many canned convenience foods, such as ready-made spaghetti, soups, stews and vegetables Convenience foods save time and trouble. They are popular with people who are busy or who don't like to cook or wash dishes. But they often cost more than fresh, unprepared foods and many contain man-made additives. Also, many people feel they don't taste as good as home-cooked foods. Health Food and Co-ops In the 1960s, a \\"back-to-the-earth\\" movement was started by young people in the United States. The movement was a reaction against the harmful effects of technology. From the movement came a new understanding of food and health. Many people now prefer natural and organic  foods to the prepared foods sold in health foods stores and in food co-ops, which are small stores where customers help manage the store. In co-ops, food is usually not packaged. Customers bring their own bags and jars and scoop  their food out of boxes or baskets. The Diet Craze  These days Americans are more and more concerned with their weight. Perhaps as many as 70 million Americans are on weight-dollar business. American supermarkets sell a variety of diet food such as soft drinks, diet candy, and diet salad dressings. Dieters also spend money on diet pills, exercise machines, and jogging suits . Each year dozens of new diets are popularized. They have such names as the Miracle  Diet, the Nine-day Wonder Diet, and the East 24-hour Diet.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music.

A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. The answer to this question is:","output":"Ann did not have incomplete dominance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake. Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongâand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriendâintroduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the middle-aged women and houseguest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not for vote for in either of his presidential runs? ?  Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

That's the question being asked today in conference rooms across the digital media industry. After Donald Trump's startling presidential victory, many are wondering if an abundance of misleading or simply made up news stories gave President-elect Trump the edge he needed to win. Critics are calling on media companies to regulate the spread of phony news reports. Already, platforms like Facebook and Google have announced plans to curtail fake news by revising their algorithms and user policies. But will such changes really improve the trustworthiness of online news? First, some perspective: The 2016 election was a stunningly low-turnout race, which ended in an ambiguous, electoral-but-not-popular victory for President-elect Trump. Fake news may have been, at most, a necessary but insufficient cause for the election's outcome. Take away one FBI press conference, or add a last-minute Clinton rally in Wisconsin, and things might have gone very differently. If fake news did move the needle in Trump's favor, it was only one of many factors affecting the outcome of a race between two of the least popular candidates of all time.Brian Hughes: Make no mistake.

Text: Although it is widely believed that a worker honey bee can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the stinger is in fact barbed so that it lodges in the victim's skin, tearing loose from the bee's abdomen and leading to its death in minutes, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's. Honey bees are the only hymenoptera with a strongly barbed sting, though yellow jackets and some other wasps have small barbs. Question: does a honey bee die after it stings you? OPTIONS:  (1). no;  (2). yes;","output":"(2). Yes, a worker honey bee does usually die after stinging a human or other mammal with thick skin. This is due to the honey bee's barbed stinger, which is designed in such a manner that it gets lodged in the victim's skin upon stinging. The bee's stinger is connected to its digestive tract and venom sac. Therefore, when a honey bee stings, not only does the barbed stinger get embedded in the victim's skin, but also a portion of the bee's abdomen, digestive tract, and venom sac gets ripped out, causing fatal injuries to the bee. Honey bees are unique among hymenoptera species, as they have a strongly barbed sting. Yellow jackets and some other wasps do have small barbs on their stingers, but they can still sting multiple times as their barbs are not as pronounced as those of honey bees. In most cases, the sting of a wasp or a hornet does not cause the stinger to get stuck in the victim's skin, allowing the insect to use its stinger multiple times without getting injured or dying in the process. When a honey bee stings a person, its defense mechanism triggers the release of alarm pheromones which can attract other bees. As a result, the victim is at risk of being attacked by multiple bees. In cases of people with an allergy to bee venom, a single sting can cause a severe allergic reaction, which can be potentially life-threatening if not treated promptly. To summarize, a honey bee does die after stinging a human or other mammal with thick skin due to its barbed stinger and the subsequent tearing of its bodily components. This is option (2), which confirms that a honey bee does, in fact, die after stinging a person with sufficiently thick skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Kind of spoils whatever the director was aiming for. The answer to this question is:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. Below are the reasons that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Criticism of the director: The reviewer highlights that the director was \\"out of touch\\" and unwilling to work with others on the project. This implies that there might have been limited collaboration or exchange of ideas during the film's creation, possibly affecting the final result. If a director does not take input or opinions of other stakeholders, it may lead to a lack of diverse perspectives in the movie, which could impact its overall quality and appeal to the audience. 2. Negative association with a familiar reference: The reviewer mentions that the word \\"Narf\\" used in the movie reminds them of an unrelated, popular animated television series – \\"Pinky and the Brain.\\" This unintentional association might distract or irritate viewers who are familiar with the referenced show, detracting from any intended artistic effect or message the director wished to convey through their choice. Since I might potentially share the same association, it could adversely affect my personal experience and enjoyment of the film. 3. Lack of positive feedback: While an absence of praise doesn't always signify that a product is undesirable, the lack of any positive comments about the film in this review does warrant caution. There are no compliments regarding the plot, acting, screenplay, or any other aspect of the film, which leaves me with little to no incentive to purchase or watch it. Without any supporting reasons to pique my interest, the apparent drawbacks mentioned become even more prominent when evaluating my decision.

Summarize this article: Dubbed the \\"Great Wall of Calais\\" by some media, it is an attempt to prevent migrants from trying to stow away on trucks heading for Britain. The 4m (13ft) barrier will run for 1km (0.6 miles) along both sides of the main road to the northern French port. The UK government has said that while it provides money for security, French authorities choose how to spend it. Local authorities in Calais say construction is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The wall will pass within a few hundred metres of the sprawling migrant camp, which charities say now houses more than 10,000 people. Home Secretary Amber Rudd previously told MPs the wall was \\"not a new initiative\\", but what mattered was making sure the French had the right amount of security to prevent \\"illegals\\" trying to get to the UK. \\"We support the French with money to help them do that,\\" she said. \\"It is up to them how they decide to secure their borders in Calais and around it.\\" Numerous fences have been built to protect the port, the Eurotunnel terminal and train tracks on the other side of Calais, and the BBC understands the wall will not replace any of those. The government has refused to confirm the cost of the wall, although reports suggest a Â£1.9m price tag - to be paid for out of Â£17m announced by David Cameron earlier this year. But Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, previously told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that instead of stopping migrants from boarding trucks, it would just \\"move the problem further down the road\\". Many of the migrants in northern France attempt to reach the UK by boarding lorries as they approach ports or the Channel Tunnel. In August, BBC footage showed people-smugglers wielding sticks and dragging a felled tree on to the main port road to stop lorries and allow migrants to climb on board. Earlier this month, French lorry drivers and farmers blockaded the main motorway route into Calais in a protest calling for the closure of the camp.","output":"A four-metre high wall funded by the UK but aimed at preventing migrants from stowing on to UK-bound trucks is to be constructed by French authorities on both sides of the main road to Calais.

The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday. \\"Some might say, why should we support this when we face tough financial times?\\" Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature. \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" The recommendation comes from the court's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases. As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges.

The ad, featuring former President Bill Clinton will run in seven crucial swing states. In the ad, Clinton makes the case for a second Obama term by contrasting the economic policies of Romney and Obama. The differences are stark. Romney wants to return to the policies of George W. Bush, which created the financial meltdown of 2008 and the Great Recession. President Obama, on the other hand, wants to invest in infrastructure and innovation while strengthening the middle class. Of the policies proposed by Romney in his 59 point economic plan, the majority match up almost identically with Republican policies from the Bush years. The Romney policies that aren’t mirrors of the Bush era – including Romney’s proposed 5 trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy – are even further to the right and more extreme than Bush. Several of Romney’s economic advisors are Bush alumni. The Obama ad carefully makes the point that Romney equals Bush, without mentioning Bush by name.

Options: - make friend - fight enemy - conquer opponent - change society - kill  Explain why a human would choose \\"kill\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"When an individual is placed in a war situation, they may be faced with various actions they must take towards another person, such as making friends, fighting enemies, conquering opponents, changing society, or even killing. Among these options, a human might choose \\"kill\\" as their answer because of numerous reasons that can be rooted in the nature of war, human behavior, and survival instincts. 1. Nature of war: War is typically characterized by aggressive behavior, armed conflict, and the use of force between opposing parties. The primary objective of war often revolves around achieving goals such as territorial control, political power, or economic influence by defeating the enemy force. In this context, killing becomes an unfortunate but necessary tactic to weaken or neutralize the enemy, thereby contributing to the accomplishment of the ultimate goal. 2. Training and conditioning: Military personnel undergo rigorous training and conditioning to prepare them for the harsh realities of war. This process often includes indoctrination in combat techniques, strategic thinking, and the development of mental and physical toughness. As a result, soldiers may become desensitized to violence, and the act of killing could be perceived as a natural consequence of their duties to protect their nation and comrades. 3. Self-preservation and survival instincts: In war, the fundamental human instinct to survive can be a powerful driving force. When faced with a life-or-death situation, the urge to eliminate the threat can override any moral or ethical considerations. The impulse to kill in order to preserve one's own life or the lives of their comrades can be difficult to suppress, making it more likely that a human would choose this option in a war scenario. 4. Dehumanization of the enemy: War often involves the dehumanization and demonization of the opposing force. This can be done through propaganda, cultural differences, or fear, and it works to create an \\"us versus them\\" mentality. This psychological distancing makes it easier for soldiers to justify acts of violence, including killing. 5. Emotional factors and stress: Warfare can be incredibly traumatic and stressful for those involved, leading to heightened emotions and impaired decision-making. Fear, anger, and the desire for revenge can cloud judgment, making it more probable that someone would choose to kill in a given situation. In conclusion, a human might choose \\"kill\\" as an answer because war exposes them to hostile situations where their survival, the protection of their comrades, and the achievement of a broader goal take precedence over the sanctity of life. Factors such as the inherent nature of war, military training, self-preservation instincts, dehumanization of the enemy, and emotional stress can contribute to this choice, making it more likely for them to view killing as a necessary aspect of war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is Kal-El found by? Jonathan and Martha Kent Answer:","output":"Step 1: Brainstorm themes and settings In order to create a compelling plot, I want to brainstorm possible themes and settings that connect to the main idea - the discovery of Kal-El (Superman) by Jonathan and Martha Kent. Let's consider a unique perspective, such as one that takes place before Kal-El becomes Superman. This will focus on the challenges the Kent family faces in raising an alien child with uncommon abilities. Possible themes: family bonds, the challenges of parenthood, hiding secrets, and self-discovery. Setting: The town of Smallville, home to the Kent family. Now, I will structure the plot based on the three-act structure, which will include setup, confrontation, and resolution. Step 2: Setup - Introducing Characters and Conflicts (Act 1) In act one, I'll lay the groundwork by introducing the main characters and the central conflict. Martha and Jonathan Kent are ordinary farmers living in Smallville. They've always dreamed of having a child, but they've struggled with infertility. One day, while working on their farm, they witness a meteor crash nearby. They rush to the site and find a spaceship with a baby alien inside, Kal-El. Step 3: Confrontation - Challenges of Raising Kal-El (Act 2) During this act, Martha and Jonathan will struggle with the challenges of raising Kal-El with his growing powers. His abilities rapidly develop, and they must hide this from their neighbors and town members. Meanwhile, a secretive government organization is hunting for the source of the mysterious crash, their search leading them closer to the Kents' farm. At the same time, the Kents' love and guidance for Kal-El helps him control his powers and teaches him to act with empathy and a strong moral compass. Kal-El, now named Clark, experiences the joys and struggles of growing up in Smallville, bonding with his adoptive family and making friends, all the while trying to contain his extraordinary powers. Step 4: Resolution - Embracing and Protecting Kal-El (Act 3) In the final act, the government organization eventually locates the Kent family farm. Martha and Jonathan are faced with the difficult decision of whether to stand against the government agents who want to take Kal-El away or reveal their secret to their community to rally support. With intervention from their fellow townspeople, many of whom have their own secrets, the community stands behind the Kent family to protect Clark. They work together to reveal the morally dubious intentions of the secret organization and expose them. Through their courageous actions, Martha and Jonathan's love for their adopted son is evident, and they've taught Clark the importance of standing up for what's right. The story concludes with the Kent family and the community united. By focusing on the Kent family, their challenges, and their love for Kal-El, we create a heartfelt story revolving around who Kal-El is found by, with themes of family bonds, parenthood, and a shared connection. This unique perspective allows us to explore Kal-El's journey as he becomes the superhero known as Superman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which group tended to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers? ?  Concurrently with designing churches and building railways, Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering sanitary reform.  By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission.  He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a \\"chief magistrate\\". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor housing, open sewers, overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration.  Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including \\"cleansing, lighting and watching\\" the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers.  The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.

The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away.

Bartenders often serve several different customers at the same time, and must juggle mixing drinks with counting money and making change.  Ability to work under pressure. Bartending can be stressful, especially if you work at a busy bar and are the only bartender on duty. Bartenders are legally required to refuse service to patrons who are visibly intoxicated. Many bartenders do not realize that they can also be held legally responsible for accidents that may occur to a customer from over serving them.  If your drunk customer leaves and hurts themselves or someone else, you and the bar can be held responsible and this may include some big fines.   You will need to learn to recognize when a patron has had enough, and in some instances, ask him or her to leave the bar. This is another reason why taking an alcohol awareness course is such a good idea for bartenders. Intoxicated patrons can become defensive, rude, and even violent when confronted, so it's important that you have an assertive personality and not be too shy to stand up to these kinds of people.

Answer the following question: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.  There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B.

Since there is no engineer available to regulate and maintain Reservoir B, the water outflow in the fall would not be properly managed. Consequently, the seasonal lowering of the water level, which helps maintain water quality and protect structures around the lake, would not occur in Reservoir B as it does in Reservoir A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 - December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor in film and television. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music. He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. Context: In the fall of 1959, Darin played \\"Honeyboy Jones\\" in an early episode of Jackie Cooper's CBS military sitcom/drama, Hennesey set in San Diego, California. In 1960, he appeared twice as himself in NBC's short-lived crime drama Dan Raven, starring Skip Homeier and set on the Sunset Strip of West Hollywood. In the same year, he was the only actor ever to have been signed to five major Hollywood film studios. He wrote music for several films in which he appeared.  His first major film, Come September (1961), was a teenager-oriented romantic comedy with Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida and featuring 18-year-old actress Sandra Dee. They first met during the production of the film, fell in love, and got married soon afterwards. Dee gave birth to a son, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known as Morgan Mitchell) on December 16, 1961. Dee and Darin made a few films together with moderate success. They divorced in 1967.  In 1961 he starred in Too Late Blues, John Cassavetes' first film for a major Hollywood studio, as a struggling jazz musician. Writing in 2012, Los Angeles Times critic Dennis Lim observed that Darin was \\"a surprise in his first nonsinging role, willing to appear both arrogant and weak.\\"  In 1962, Darin won the Golden Globe Award for \\"New Star of the Year - Actor\\" for his role in Come September. The following year he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama\\" (Best actor) in Pressure Point.  In 1963, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as a shell-shocked soldier in Captain Newman, M.D.. At the Cannes Film Festival he won the French Film Critics Award for best actor.  In October 1964, he appeared as a wounded ex-convict who is befriended by an orphan girl in \\"The John Gillman Story\\" episode of NBC's Wagon Train western television series. Question: Who else did he work with? Answer:","output":"Bobby Darin worked with many people throughout his career in music and movies. In his first major film, 'Come September', he appeared alongside Rock Hudson, Gina Lollobrigida, and Sandra Dee, who later became his wife. He also worked with actor Skip Homeier in NBC's drama 'Dan Raven,' and in the movie 'Too Late Blues,' he worked with director John Cassavetes. He also appeared in the show 'Wagon Train' on NBC. Let's not forget also that he began his career writing songs for Connie Francis. So, you see, Bobby Darin worked with lots of different talented people!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Sloshing of Earth’s core may spike major earthquakes      SEATTLE—The world doesn’t stop spinning. But every so often, it slows down. For decades, scientists have charted tiny fluctuations in the length of Earth’s day: Gain a millisecond here, lose a millisecond there. Last week at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America here, two geophysicists argued that these minute changes could be enough to influence the timing of major earthquakes—and potentially help forecast them.      During the past 100 years, Earth’s slowdowns have correlated surprisingly well with periods with a global increase in magnitude-7 and larger earthquakes, according to Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder and Rebecca Bendick at the University of Montana in Missoula. Usefully, the spike, which adds two to five more quakes than typical, happens well after the slow-down begins. “The Earth offers us a 5-years heads up on future earthquakes, which is remarkable,” says Bilham, who presented the work.      Most seismologists agree that earthquake prediction is a minefield. And so far, Bilham and Bendick have only fuzzy, hard-to-test ideas about what might cause the pattern they found. But the finding is too provocative to ignore, other researchers say. “The correlation they’ve found is remarkable, and deserves investigation,” says Peter Molnar, a geologist also at CU.      The research started as a search for synchrony in earthquake timing. Individual oscillators, be they fireflies, heart muscles, or metronomes, can end up vibrating in synchrony as a result of some kind of cross-talk—or some common influence. To Bendick, it didn’t seem a far jump to consider the faults that cause earthquakes, with their cyclical buildup of strain and violent discharge, as “really noisy, really crummy oscillators,” she says. She and Bilham dove into the data, using the only complete earthquake catalog for the past 100 years: magnitude-7 and larger earthquakes.      In work published in August in Geophysical Research Letters they reported two patterns: First, major quakes appeared to cluster in time—although not in space. And second, the number of large earthquakes seemed to peak at 32-year intervals. The earthquakes could be somehow talking to each other, or an external force could be nudging the earth into rupture.      Exploring such global forces, the researchers eventually discovered the match with the length of day. Although weather patterns such as El Nino can drive day length to vary back and forth by a millisecond over a year or more, a periodic, decades-long fluctuation of several milliseconds—in particular, its point of peak slow down about every three decades or so—lined up with the quake trend perfectly. \\"Of course that seems sort of crazy,\\" Bendick says. But maybe it isn’t. When day length changes over decades, Earth’s magnetic field also develops a temporary ripple. Researchers think slight changes in the flow of the molten iron of the outer core may be responsible for both effects. Just what happens is uncertain—perhaps a bit of the molten outer core sticks to the mantle above. That might change the flow of the liquid metal, altering the magnetic field, and transfer enough momentum between the mantle and the core to affect day length.      Seismologists aren’t used to thinking about the planet’s core, buried 2900 kilometers beneath the crust where quakes happen. But they should, Bilham said during his talk here. The core is “quite close to us. It’s closer than New York from here,” he said.      At the equator, Earth spins 460 meters per second. Given this high velocity, it’s not absurd to think that a slight mismatch in speed between the solid crust and mantle and the liquid core could translate into a force somehow nudging quakes into synchrony, Molnar says. Of course, he adds, “It might be nonsense.” But the evidence for some kind of link is compelling, says geophysicist Michael Manga of the University of California, Berkeley. “I’ve worked on earthquakes triggered by seasonal variation, melting snow. His correlation is much better than what I’m used to seeing.”      One way or another, says James Dolan, a geologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, “we’re going to know in 5 years.” That’s because Earth’s rotation began a periodic slow-down 4-plus years ago. Beginning next year, Earth should expect five more major earthquakes a year than average—between 17 to 20 quakes, compared with the anomalously low four so far this year. If the pattern holds, it will put a new spin on earthquake forecasting. ||||| Scientists have found strong evidence that 2018 will see a big uptick in the number of large earthquakes globally. Earth's rotation, as with many things, is cyclical, slowing down by a few milliseconds per day then speeding up again.      You and I will never notice this very slight variation in the rotational speed of Earth. However, we will certainly notice the result, an increase in the number of severe earthquakes.      Geophysicists are able to measure the rotational speed of Earth extremely precisely, calculating slight variations on the order of milliseconds. Now, scientists believe a slowdown of the Earth's rotation is the link to an observed cyclical increase in earthquakes.      To start, the research team of geologists analyzed every earthquake to occur since 1900 at a magnitude above 7.0. They were looking for trends in the occurrence of large earthquakes. What they found is that roughly every 32 years there was an uptick in the number of significant earthquakes worldwide.      The team was puzzled as to the root cause of this cyclicity in earthquake rate. They compared it with a number of global historical datasets and found only one that showed a strong correlation with the uptick in earthquakes. That correlation was to the slowing down of Earth's rotation. Specifically, the team noted that around every 25-30 years Earth's rotation began to slow down and that slowdown happened just before the uptick in earthquakes. The slowing rotation historically has lasted for 5 years, with the last year triggering an increase in earthquakes.      To add an interesting twist to the story, 2017 was the 4th consecutive year that Earth's rotation has slowed. This is why the research team believes we can expect more earthquakes in 2018, it is the last of a 5-year slowdown in Earth's rotation.      What Is Causing Earth's Rotation To Slow Down?      As with many new findings in science, this story began with the data that supports the cyclical slowdown then speed up of Earth's rotation. The research team is then tasked with the \\"why\\" to explain this phenomenon. While scientists aren't exactly sure the mechanisms that produce this variation, there are a few hypotheses.      One hypothesis involves Earth's outer core, a liquid metal layer of the planet that circulates underneath the solid lower mantle. The thought is that the outer core can at times \\"stick\\" to the mantle, causing a disruption in its flow. This would alter Earth's magnetic field and produce a temporary hiccup in Earth's rotation.      Currently, the data only notes a striking correlation, but no causation. Hence, scientists are still unsure whether this change in Earth's rotation is the cause of an uptick in earthquakes.      While there's no direct link between the two, the trend over the past century suggests that 2018 will be an unusually active year for earthquakes. Typically, there will be 15-20 large earthquakes (M 7.0 or greater). However, during the noted uptick in earthquakes aligning to the 5th year of Earth's rotation slowdown there are on average 25-30 large earthquakes.      Earthquakes remain the most difficult natural disaster to predict. They tend to occur with little to no forewarning and can thus be incredibly destructive. Often times, geologists are limited to historical trends in data to predict the likelihood an earthquake will occur. This new research provides another dataset to inform communities about the near-term risks they face.      Liked the article? I highly recommend reading our in-house astrophysicist's thoughts on the subject. ||||| Summary:","output":"Recent research has found a correlation between slow-downs in the Earth's rotation and global increases in magnitude-7 earthquakes.

Key players such as Wayne Rooney, Antonio Valencia, and Luke Shaw were rested for the upcoming Premier League match. Mourinho plans to return to a normal team without making so many changes for future games. Feyenoord's late winner was scored by Tonny Vilhena, albeit from an offside assist by Nicolai Jorgensen. This defeat marks United's fourth consecutive loss in European away games and follows a 2-1 home defeat by Manchester City. Notable lineup changes included Valencia and Shaw being replaced by Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo. Additionally, Ander Herrera, Anthony Martial, Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford, Morgan Schneiderlin, and Chris Smalling were brought in. Despite these changes, midfielder Paul Pogba, the world record £89m signing from Juventus, struggled to make an impact on the game. Mourinho avoids individualizing the performance but mentioned that the team played at half pace in the first half, and only in the second half, when they increased intensity, did they concede the goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, to combine these like terms, we perform the addition: 56 - 21 = 35 Now the equation becomes: -7*v + 35 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable v To isolate v, we want to move the constant 35 to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 35 from both sides: -7*v + 35 - 35 = 0 - 35 -7*v = -35 Step 3: Solve for v Now we simply need to divide both sides by the coefficient of v, which is -7: (-7*v) / (-7) = (-35) / (-7) v = 5 So, the solution for v is: v = 5"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The band made its national television debut in support of the album, performing \\"The Trees Get Wheeled Away\\" (a track that was not on the album) on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman\\". The album is referenced in the Jonathan Franzen novel \\"Freedom\\" when the main characters Walter and Richard attend a Bright Eyes concert in Washington D.C. during the \\"Lifted\\" tour.  - Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the \\"Creekers\\".

Translate to English English:","output":"Bosnian authorities expressed their support for Delič, stating that the BHCO generally respects international war agreements.  To provide a more detailed interpretation of this statement, Bosnian officials have reportedly given their backing to the person named Delič, identifying him as a respectable figure tied to the BHCO. It is implied that this individual carries out his duties in accordance with international laws of warfare, and therefore, warrants endorsement from the authorities. The BHCO may be an organization or body that operates within the sphere of conflict and warfare. The recognition of the BHCO's adherence to war agreements indicates that they have demonstrated a track record of conducting operations that conform to the global standards, norms, and legal conventions used to govern the behavior of participating entities during times of war. In other words, BHCO has shown respect towards internationally agreed rules meant to limit the effects of armed conflict for humanitarian reasons.  This helps to preserve certain human rights and maintain a certain standard of human decency in a war scenario, ensuring protection of civilians, aid workers, soldiers who are Prisoners of War (POWs) or wounded, sick or shipwrecked.  This backing from the Bosnian authorities towards Delič and BHCO also seems to be part of an effort to build or maintain a favorable national image of adherence to international practices, war ethics and regulations, showing that the nation respects and values international humanitarian law.  While the statement does not elaborate further, such issues tend to involve intricate political dynamics, and therefore, this endorsement could indeed be a considered response from Bosnian officials, who might be trying to balance the often delicate regional, national, and international considerations that are related to the conduct of warfare.  Therefore, their acknowledgement contributes to upholding Bosnia's place in the global community, affirming the state's commitment to maintaining peace, preserving human rights, and upholding the conventions that regulate warfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general.  - Social work is an academic and practice-based professional discipline that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups. It may promote social change, development, cohesion, and empowerment. Underpinned by theories of social sciences and guided by principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being.  - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic).  - Battle of Kaniv, or Battle of Kaniów took place during World War I on the night of 1011 May 1918, near Kaniv, Ukraine between Polish and German army troops. The fighting pitted the Polish II Corps in Russia (including Brigade II of the Polish Legions), under general Józef Haller von Hallenburg, against the German Imperial Army (including the 28th Landwehr Brigade), under general Zierhold. Ultimately the Germans were victorious with about half of the Polish forces surrendering and the rest retreating in disarray.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - The Triple Entente (from French \\"entente\\" \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") was the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy, though Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I, and joined the Entente Powers instead, in the 1915 Treaty of London.  - The Order of Polonia Restituta is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921. It is conferred to both military and civilians as well as to foreigners for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, national defense, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries.  - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.  - The Battle of Raracza was fought between Polish Legionnaires, and Austria-Hungary, from February 15 to 16, 1918, near Raracza in Bukovina, and ended with a Polish victory.  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Second in Command is a 2006 American action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and directed by Simon Fellows. The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on May 2, 2006.  - The Polish II Corps in Russia was a Polish military formation formed in revolutionary Russia in 1917.  - The Austro-Hungarian Army was the ground force of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy from 1867 to 1918. It was composed of three parts: the joint army (\\", \\"Common Army\\", recruited from all parts of the country), the Imperial Austrian Landwehr (recruited from Cisleithania), and the Royal Hungarian Honved (recruited from Transleithania).  - Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River.  - Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to AustriaHungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918.  - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency.

The Legions became \\"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Raracza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against imperial Germany.

By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

Article: Most students try to learn English grammar using grammar textbooks. They study grammar rules and take grammar tests. They use an analytical  approach, attempting to memorize, and then apply, a great number of rules. However, research has proved this method inefficient and ineffective. The truth is, the human brain simply cannot consciously remember process and use hundreds of or thousands of grammar rules. Real speech is too fast. Native speakers do not learn grammar in this way, but rather intuitively   and unconsciously. They learn in a complete way, not by attempting to memorize individual grammar rules. As a result, native speakers use correct grammar fluently and easily. Fortunately, it is possible for English learners to learn grammar this way. Language teacher Blaine Ray has developed a unique \\"intuitive\\" approach to teach English grammar. Her system uses \\"point of view\\" stories to teach the patterns of English grammar, allowing students unconsciously to acquire correct grammar without ever studying grammar rules. In this system, the teacher first tells a simple story from one point of view. It may be told about the past, then repeated, but beginning with \\"since he was a child\\"; then repeated again, but this time about the future. Listening to these stories allows students intuitively and effortlessly to learn English grammar and makes them be able to use it correctly when they speak. Point of View Stories is a creative new way to study English grammar, and offers hope to millions of frustrated English learners. Question: Why shouldn't the English learners use an analytical approach? - because the analytical approach can let them learn English grammar effortlessly - because the analytical approach makes them be able to use English correctly when they speak. - because the analytical approach can't let them memorize and then apply a great number of rules. - because Real speech is too fast.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

To make it simple, a railroad spike is a big nail used to hold train tracks together. We can turn it into a hammer using these two steps: 1. First, find a grown-up person who knows how to work with metal. They will need to heat up the railroad spike until it's really, really hot! It gets as hot as a melted marshmallow on a campfire. This makes it easy to shape the spike. They will use tools like a hammer and an anvil, which is a special block to hit things on. 2. After the spike is shaped like a hammer, it needs to cool down. When it's cool enough, the grown-up can add a handle to it. They will attach a wooden or metal stick to the hammer part, so you can easily hold and swing it. Now you know the steps to make a hammer from a railroad spike! But remember, always ask a grown-up for help - this is not something a five-year-old should try on their own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The peppermint, on the other hand, evoked memories of cold winter nights and the biting sensation that accompanied candies and toothpaste.

Step 1: Reflect on the existing storyline and analyze the reasons behind Alexandria's choice. At this point in the story, we've established that Alexandria has a strong emotional connection to the vanilla scent due to her pleasant memories involving her grandmother's kitchen. On the other hand, the peppermint scent is associated with colder and less comforting sensations. Step 2: Consider possible developments and choose a direction for the story. To continue the story, we need to give the reader a sense of what happens next. This could involve Alexandria purchasing the vanilla fragrance, sharing her thoughts or emotions with someone, or experiencing a shift in emotions as she recalls other memories related to the fragrance. Step 3: Craft the next section of the story, keeping the character's motivation and emotional state in mind. As Alexandria held the bottle of vanilla fragrance in her hands, she couldn't help but smile as more memories rushed into her mind: Saturday afternoons spent baking with her grandmother, the laughter they'd shared, and the warm embrace of her grandmother's arms. Even the delicate etchings on the bottle's design seemed to echo the pattern of her grandmother's apron. Overwhelmed with nostalgia, Alexandria decided to buy the fragrance as a way to keep these cherished memories close, even in her everyday life.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes      Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party has summoned its MPs to discuss the future of its leader, President Robert Mugabe, after a deadline for his resignation came and went on Monday.      The deadline was set by Mr Mugabe's own party, Zanu-PF.      The embattled leader surprised Zimbabweans on Sunday, declaring on TV that he planned to remain as president.      Zanu-PF says it backs impeachment, and proceedings could begin as soon as Tuesday when parliament meets.      In a draft motion seen by Reuters news agency, the party blamed the president for an \\"unprecedented economic tailspin\\".      Mr Mugabe's grip on power has weakened considerably since the country's army intervened last Wednesday in a row over who should succeed him.      The crisis began two weeks ago when the 93-year-old leader sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife Grace as next president.      Zimbabwe has since then seen huge street rallies demanding his immediate resignation.      The protests have been backed by the influential war veterans - who fought in the conflict that led to independence from Britain in 1980.      The group's leader, Chris Mutsvangwa, on Monday called for more demonstrations. \\"Mugabe, your rule is over,\\" Mr Mutsvangwa said. \\"The emperor has no clothes.\\"      Choreographing a departure      Andrew Harding in Harare      The city is swirling with rumours that Mr Mugabe is planning his resignation and that he may go back on television to announce it at any stage, and that Sunday's speech was simply about giving carte blanche to the military for what they've done.      But we just don't know at this stage if he will give in to the pressure from the war veterans, his own party, and the public.      Mr Mugabe said in his speech that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month, a statement people here found baffling after the party voted to strip him of his leadership and kick out his wife.      What is clear is that everyone here believes that the Mugabe era is over. Saturday's protests unleashed something and people believe that a line has been crossed. Now it is really about negotiating the time, the process, the choreography of Mr Mugabe's departure.      The fear of Zanu-PF and of the security services will not go away overnight. People here grew up with that fear. In the meantime, the streets are calm, but Tuesday may bring more demonstrations.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mugabe: \\"The congress is due... I will preside over its processes\\"      What did Mugabe say in his speech?      During the 20-minute address, the president, who was flanked by generals, made no mention of the pressure from his party and the public to quit.      Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong by seizing power and placing him under house arrest.      \\"Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,\\" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster in the capital Harare.      He also said \\"the [Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes\\".      Before Mr Mugabe's speech, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections, while Mr Mugabe's wife was expelled.      BBC Africa Editor Fergal Keane said his understanding was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind.      Our correspondent says the generals have no intention of forcing Mr Mugabe out by the barrel of a gun, and are happy to let the Zanu-PF carry out its procedures, working through impeachment if necessary.      So what happens next?      Impeachment proceedings could be launched on Tuesday in parliament - but it is not clear how long this would take.      Both the National Assembly and the Senate need to pass a vote by simple majority to begin the process, which is laid out in the constitution.      This can either be on grounds of \\"serious misconduct\\", \\"violation\\" of the constitution or \\"failure to obey, uphold or defend\\" it, or \\"incapacity\\".      The chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president.      If the committee recommends impeachment, the president can then be removed if both houses back it with two-thirds majorities.      The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zimbabwe reacts: \\"We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now\\"      The advantage for the military is that if Mr Mugabe is impeached, it can claim that he was removed legally, and not by force.      The problem for the generals is that the current vice-president would then take power. That is Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Mr Mugabe's wife Grace.      The military would prefer to install Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice-president who was briefly exiled.      And it is still possible that Mr Mugabe could delay the process or cling to power by refusing to resign - and be forced into exile himself.      What's the reaction been?      The War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe, now says it is time for him to step down.      \\"Thirty-seven years, you have had your time, you are toast now politically,\\" Mr Mutsvangwa told the BBC.      Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was \\"baffled\\" by the president's address.      \\"He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,\\" he told Reuters news agency.

A Zimbabwe ruling party official confirmed Sunday, Nov. 19, 2017 that the Central Committee has fired President Robert Mugabe as party leader and replaced... (Associated Press)      JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Emmerson Mnangagwa, elected Sunday as the new leader of Zimbabwe's ruling political party and positioned to take over as the country's president, has engineered a remarkable comeback using skills he no doubt learned from his longtime mentor, President Robert Mugabe.      Mnangagwa served for decades as Mugabe's enforcer — a role that gave him a reputation for being astute, ruthless and effective at manipulating the levers of power. Among the population, he is more feared than popular, but he has strategically fostered a loyal support base within the military and security forces.      A leading government figure since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, he became vice president in 2014 and is so widely known as the \\"Crocodile\\" that his supporters are called Team Lacoste for the brand's crocodile logo.      The 75-year-old \\"is smart and skillful, but will he be a panacea for Zimbabwe's problems? Will he bring good governance and economic management? We'll have to watch this space,\\" said Piers Pigou, southern Africa expert for the International Crisis Group.      Mugabe unwittingly set in motion the events that led to his own downfall, firing his vice president on Nov. 6. Mnangagwa fled the country to avoid arrest while issuing a ringing statement saying he would return to lead Zimbabwe.      \\"Let us bury our differences and rebuild a new and prosperous Zimbabwe, a country that is tolerant to divergent views, a country that respects opinions of others, a country that does note isolate itself from the rest of the world because of one stubborn individual who believes he is entitled to rule this country until death,\\" he said in the Nov. 8 statement.      He has not been seen in public but is believed to be back in Zimbabwe.      For weeks, Mnangagwa had been publicly demonized by Mugabe and his wife. Grace, so he had time to prepare his strategy. Within days of the vice president's dismissal, his supporters in the military put Mugabe and his wife under house arrest.      When Mugabe refused to resign, a massive demonstration Saturday brought thousands of people into the streets of the capital, Harare. It was not a spontaneous uprising. Thousands of professionally produced posters praising Mnangagwa and the military had been printed ahead of time.      \\"It was not a last-minute operation,\\" Pigou said. \\"The demonstration was orchestrated.\\"      At the same time, Mnangagwa's allies in the ruling ZANU-PF party lobbied for the removal of Mugabe as the party leader. At a Central Committee meeting Sunday, Mnangagwa was voted in as the new leader of the party, which had been led by Mugabe since 1977.      In an interview with The Associated Press years ago, Mnangagwa was terse and stone-faced, backing up his reputation for saying little but acting decisively. Party insiders say that he can be charming and has friends of all colors.      Mnangagwa joined the fight against white minority rule in Rhodesia while still a teen in the 1960s. In 1963, he received military training in Egypt and China. As one of the earliest guerrilla fighters against Ian Smith's Rhodesian regime, he was captured, tortured and convicted of blowing up a locomotive in 1965.      Sentenced to death by hanging, he was found to be under 21, and his punishment was commuted to 10 years in prison. He was jailed with other prominent nationalists including Mugabe.      While imprisoned, Mnangagwa studied through a correspondence school. After his release in 1975, he went to Zambia, where he completed a law degree and started practicing. Soon he went to newly independent Marxist Mozambique, where he became Mugabe's assistant and bodyguard. In 1979, he accompanied Mugabe to the Lancaster House talks in London that led to the end of Rhodesia and the birth of Zimbabwe.      \\"Our relationship has over the years blossomed beyond that of master and servant to father and son,\\" Mnangagwa wrote this month of his relationship with Mugabe.      When Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, Mnangagwa was appointed minister of security. He directed the merger of the Rhodesian army with Mugabe's guerrilla forces and the forces of rival nationalist leader Joshua Nkomo. Ever since, he has kept close ties with the military and security forces.      In 1983, Mugabe launched a brutal campaign against Nkomo's supporters that became known as the Matabeleland massacres for the deaths of 10,000 to 20,000 Ndebele people in Zimbabwe's southern provinces.      Mnangagwa was widely blamed for planning the campaign of the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade on their deadly mission into the Matabeleland provinces. Mnangagwa denies this.      He also is reputed to have amassed a considerable fortune and was named in a United Nations investigation into exploitation of mineral resources in Congo and has been active in making Harare a significant diamond trading center.      In 2008, he was Mugabe's election agent in balloting that was marked by violence and allegations of vote-rigging. He also helped broker the creation of a coalition government that brought in opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister.      In recent years, Mnangagwa has promoted himself as an experienced leader who will bring stability to Zimbabwe. But his promises to return Zimbabwe to democracy and prosperity are viewed with skepticism by many experts.      \\"He has successfully managed a palace coup that leaves ZANU-PF and the military in charge. He's been Mugabe's bag man for decades,\\" said Zimbabwean author and commentator Peter Godwin. \\"I have low expectations about what he will achieve as president. I hope I will be proved wrong.\\"      Godwin, who has followed Mnangagwa for years, said he has little of Mugabe's charisma or talent for public speaking.      Todd Moss, Africa expert for the Center for Global Development, also expressed reservations.      \\"Despite his claims to be a business-friendly reformer, Zimbabweans know Mnangagwa is the architect of the Matabeland massacres and that he abetted Mugabe's looting of the country,\\" Moss said. \\"Mnangagwa is part of its sad past, not its future.\\" ||||| HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe stunned Zimbabwe on Sunday by making no mention of resignation in a television address, defying his own ZANU-PF party, which had sacked him hours earlier, and hundreds of thousands of protesters who had already hailed his downfall.      Two sources - one a senior member of the government, the other familiar with talks with leaders of the military - had told Reuters Mugabe would announce his resignation to the nation after ZANU-PF dismissed him as its leader in a move precipitated by an army takeover four days earlier.      But in the speech from his State House office, sitting alongside a row of generals, Mugabe acknowledged criticisms from ZANU-PF, the military and the public but made no mention of his own position.      Instead, he said the events of the week were not “a challenge to my authority as head of state and government”, and pledged to preside over the congress scheduled for next month.      Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was dumbstruck.      “I am baffled. It’s not just me, it’s the whole nation. He’s playing a game,” he told Reuters. “He is trying to manipulate everyone. He has let the whole nation down.”      ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old, who has led his country since independence in 1980, less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto military coup.      Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of the liberation war veterans who have been spearheading an 18-month campaign to oust Mugabe, said plans to impeach him in parliament, which next sits on Tuesday, would now go ahead, and that there would be mass protests on Wednesday.      He also implied that Mugabe, who spoke with a firm voice but occasionally lost his way in his script during the 20-minute address, was not aware of what had happened just hours earlier.      “BLIND OR DEAF”      “Either somebody within ZANU-PF didn’t tell him what had happened within his own party, so he went and addressed that meeting oblivious, or (he was) blind or deaf to what his party has told him,” Mutsvangwa said.      ZANU-PF’s central committee had earlier named Emmerson Mnangagwa as its new leader. It was Mugabe’s sacking of Mnangagwa as his vice-president - to pave the way for his wife Grace to succeed him - that triggered the army’s intervention.      People watch as Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe addresses the nation on television, at a bar in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 19, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo      On Saturday, hundreds of thousands had taken to the streets of the capital Harare to celebrate Mugabe’s expected downfall and hail a new era for their country.      In jubilant scenes, men, women and children ran alongside armoured cars and the troops who stepped in to target what the army called “criminals” in Mugabe’s inner circle.      Many heralded a “second liberation” and spoke of their dreams for political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship.      They, like the more than 3 million Zimbabweans who have emigrated to neighbouring South Africa in search of a better life, are likely to be bitterly disappointed by Mugabe’s defiance.      Speaking from a secret location in South Africa, his nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, had told Reuters that Mugabe and his wife were “ready to die for what is correct” rather than step down in order to legitimise what he described as a coup.      Zhuwao, who was also sanctioned by ZANU-PF, did not answer his phone on Sunday. However, Mugabe’s son Chatunga railed against those who had pushed out his father.      “You can’t fire a Revolutionary leader!” he wrote on this Facebook page. “ZANU-PF is nothing without President Mugabe.”      DANGER AHEAD      The huge crowds in Harare have given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army’s intervention, backing its assertion that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, rather than a plain coup, which would risk a diplomatic backlash.      But some of Mugabe’s opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military, and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another, rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader.      “The real danger of the current situation is that, having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,” former education minister David Coltart said.      The United States, a longtime Mugabe critic, said it was looking forward to a new era in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighbouring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once.      Slideshow (24 Images)      Besides changing its leadership, ZANU-PF said it wanted to change the constitution to reduce the power of the president, a possible sign of a desire to move towards a more pluralistic and inclusive political system.      However, Mnangagwa’s history as state security chief during the so-called Gukurahundi crackdown, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland in the early 1980s, suggested that quick, sweeping change was unlikely.      “The deep state that engineered this change of leadership will remain, thwarting any real democratic reform,” said Miles Tendi, a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has called a meeting of its members of parliament to discuss the future of President Robert Mugabe, after he failed to meet the deadline set by his own party to resign on 20 November.

Costa and Fabregas will help to solve that problem. Mourinho admits Chelsea need 'more quality' in their football. Fabregas will offer something different to Chelsea's box-to-box midfielders. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: How the Addition of Costa and Fabregas Will Enhance Chelsea's Attacking Prowess  Introduction: Chelsea have been a dominant force in English football in recent years, but they have often struggled to break down opponents who employ a compact, defensive mindset - packing their half with 10 men behind the ball. Manager José Mourinho is well aware of this issue and has recently acknowledged the need for 'more quality' within the team's style of play. The signings of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas could just be the solution to Chelsea's problem, providing a fresh attacking impetus capable of unlocking even the most resolute defences. Step 1: Analyzing the problem When facing a team that puts 10 men behind the ball, Chelsea often finds itself bereft of ideas and unable to create clear-cut chances. This is largely due to a lack of unpredictability in their play and an absence of players with the vision and skill to find those pockets of space or deliver that killer pass. Step 2: Incorporating Costa and Fabregas Acquiring the services of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas brings a new dynamic to the Chelsea attack. Costa, known for his physicality and potency in front of goal, will occupy defenders and create space for his teammates. His movement off the ball and ability to finish from anywhere in the box makes him a constant threat. Fabregas, on the other hand, offers something different from Chelsea's current crop of box-to-box midfielders. The Spanish international possesses a footballing brain that few can match, and he has the capacity to dictate play and provide incisive through balls in tight spaces. His creativity, coupled with his eye for a pass, will enable Chelsea to penetrate deep-lying defensive lines more effectively. Step 3: Adapting the team's style of play In order to fully exploit the talents of Costa and Fabregas, Mourinho must adjust the team's approach to matches. The Portuguese tactician should encourage his side to transition quickly from defence to attack, utilizing the pace and power of Costa coupled with the guile and inventiveness of Fabregas. By playing a more fluid and dynamic brand of football, Chelsea can keep their opposition unsettled and force them to reorganize constantly, creating openings and vulnerabilities for the likes of Costa and Fabregas to exploit. Step 4: Capitalizing on set pieces One other area where Chelsea can improve is their conversion rate from set pieces. With the likes of Costa, Gary Cahill, and John Terry all dangerous in the air, Fabregas' expertise at delivering accurate dead balls could prove to be an essential weapon in breaking down stubborn defensive units. Conclusion: The signing of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas represents a step in the right direction for Chelsea in their quest to overcome deep-lying defences. While no tactic or player can guarantee success against opponents who sit back and park the bus, the presence of Costa and Fabregas within the Blues' ranks offers new layers of creativity and a tactical adaptability that should make the task of unlocking resolute backlines a far less daunting prospect for Mourinho's men this season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Objective: How do you break a window? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. [I] Hit the center with a dense object such as a brick or bowling ball. [II] Hit the corner with an object such as a stick, small rock or dirt.","output":"Based on the principles of naive physics, the premise is that objects behave according to certain fundamental principles which include gravity, solidity, continuity, and inertia. Now if we use naive physics reasoning for breaking a window, it would be better to approach this with two concerns: the object's mass and the point of contact on the window. [I] Hitting the center with a dense object such as a brick or bowling ball: A dense object like a brick or bowling ball has significant mass. This means that it has a greater ability to exert force, in the form of kinetic energy, upon impact. Additionally, hitting the center of the window, which is the widest part, would distribute the impact force across a large area, minimizing the chance of the force being absorbed by the window without causing breakage. [II] Hitting the corner with an object such as a stick, small rock or dirt: An object like a stick, small rock or dirt has less mass and may not exert enough force to break the window. Furthermore, hitting the corner of the window isn't usually effective in breaking it. The corners are structurally more resilient because they're supported on two sides by the window frame, which can distribute and therefore reduce the impact.  So, based on the principles of naive physics, Solution [I] Hitting the center with a large, dense object such as a brick or bowling ball is more likely to be effective at breaking a window. The dense object would have a higher mass, meaning more kinetic energy to exert upon impact. Also, hitting the center, the widest part of the window, would distribute the impact force across a larger surface area, generating more stress on the glass and increasing the likelihood of causing a break. However, it must be noted breaking windows intentionally is not advised and is generally unlawful unless it's for a justifiable purpose such as escaping from an enclosed space in an emergency situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The boys had told the school in the small, northern town of Therwil it was against their faith to touch a woman outside their family. Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said shaking hands was part of Swiss culture and daily life. A local teachers' union said the exemption discriminated against women. The case has propelled Therwil, a town of 10,000 people in the Basel-Country canton, to the centre of a national debate about Swiss identity. A similar case has been reported elsewhere in the region. Christian Amsler, head of the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education, suggested that the school may have tried to get an \\"unpleasant problem out of the way\\" but had simply made a mistake. There has been little support for the school's decision to grant special dispensation to the boys, who are 14 and 15 and have lived in Switzerland for several years. Therwil Mayor Reto Wolf said the community was unhappy with the decision taken by the school, which is run by the local canton. \\"In our culture and in our way of communication a handshake is normal and sends out respect for the other person, and this has to be brought [home] to the children in school,\\" he told the BBC. Felix Mueri, the head of the Swiss parliament's education commission and a member of the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party, said the decision sent out the wrong message. \\"Today's it's the handshake and what will it be tomorrow?\\" Muslim groups also disagreed with the school's response. There was no reference in the Koran justifying a refusal to shake a woman teacher's hand, said the Swiss Federation of Islamic Organisations. Saida Keller-Messahli of the Forum for Progressive Islam urged the Swiss not to give in to extremist demands. However the smaller Islamic Central Council of Switzerland said that a handshake between men and women was prohibited. \\"After the sex attacks in Cologne (on New Year's Eve), they asked Muslims to keep their distance from women; now they demand they get closer to them,\\" spokesman Qaasim Illi told Swiss media. The justice minister said such dispensation for children was not her idea of integration. The beleaguered school has tried to find a compromise, by deciding that the two pupils should not greet either men or women with a handshake. Headteacher Juerg Lauener said the school had no reason to adjust its policy, unless the local authorities ruled against its decision. Local education officials said the school had taken a pragmatic approach, but agreed it was not a permanent solution as rules should be the same for all pupils. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a situation in a small town in Switzerland called Therwil. Two Muslim boys said they couldn't shake hands with women teachers because of their faith. The school allowed them not to do it, but many people didn't agree with the decision.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Does happiness have a scent? When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings.

Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies.  - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\").  - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.  - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' .  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.  - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.  - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

We do this by performing the following steps: 1. Move all terms with the variable a to the left side of the equation: First, we add 3*a to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -3*a term from the right side of the equation: 16*a + 3*a = -3*a + 3*a - 76 (16 + 3)*a = -76 This can be simplified to: 19*a = -76 2. Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of a (in this case, 19) to find the value of a: 19*a / 19 = -76 / 19 a = -4 So, the solution to the equation 16*a = -3*a - 76 is a = -4."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A gunman in an Afghan National Army uniform and another man shot dead two NATO soldiers at a combat outpost in southern Afghanistan Thursday, authorities said. The dead soldiers were Americans, according to Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi, the district chief in Kandahar province, where the shooting happened. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, however, did not immediately specify the service members' nationalities. Thursday's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that U.S. troops mistakenly burned Qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage, protests, and violence across Afghanistan. \\"Though less than 1% of","output":"the Afghan National Army is believed to be infiltrated by Taliban members or sympathizers, these 'green-on-blue' attacks have raised concerns among NATO forces about the trustworthiness of their Afghan counterparts. In the aftermath of the Quran burnings, tensions between NATO and Afghan forces were at an all-time high, and the recent attacks only served to intensify the mistrust. Despite multiple apologies from U.S. officials and increased security measures, the violence continued to escalate throughout the region. Realizing the need for a change in strategy, NATO and Afghan government officials decided to begin peace talks with the Taliban in an effort to bring an end to the seemingly endless conflict. These negotiations were initially met with skepticism, but after several months of dialogue, an unexpected breakthrough occurred. The Taliban, realizing their struggle was doing more harm than good to the people of Afghanistan, agreed to lay down their arms. In return, the Afghan government promised a more inclusive political process that would involve all parties, including former Taliban members who renounced violence. With this historic agreement in place, NATO forces began a gradual withdrawal from Afghanistan, always ensuring that the Afghan National Army was fully trained and equipped to maintain security within the country. The transition was not without its challenges, but the commitment to peace by all parties involved eventually led to a stable and democratic Afghanistan. This new era marked the beginning of a long journey towards rebuilding and healing the nation, after decades of war and violence. The people of Afghanistan, led by a strong and inclusive government, slowly but surely began to build a brighter future for themselves and their children. The final chapter of this story ends on a hopeful note, as Afghans from all walks of life come together to work towards a common goal: a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, where the tragedies of the past can be laid to rest, and a new chapter of unity and progress can begin.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Bisphosphonates are currently used for the treatment of bone metastases, and emerging data suggest that they may also have antitumor properties. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that zoledronic acid can inhibit angiogenesis, invasion and adhesion of tumor cells, and overall tumor progression, and emerging evidence suggests that the use of these agents may impede the development of skeletal metastases. In a recent clinical study in patients with metastatic bone disease, basal levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, a factor essential for angiogenesis, were significantly reduced in patients receiving zoledronic acid, suggesting that zoledronic acid may have clinically relevant antiangiogenic properties. Early clinical data on prevention of bone metastases by the early-generation bisphosphonate clodronate have yielded promising results in patients with breast cancer, and trials are currently ongoing to assess the efficacy of clodronate in this setting. Similarly, the new-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has demonstrated activity in the prevention of bone metastases in small, 18-month pilot studies in patients with high-risk solid tumors (N=40; P=0.0002). Similarly, in a separate 5-year trial, the overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma was greater in patients whose standard treatment regimens included zoledronic acid compared with standard treatment alone (P<0.01). These encouraging early clinical results supported the initiation of larger randomized trials that are currently ongoing.

Q:Question: \\"Who made donating money convenient?\\"  Context: \\"Following the earthquake, donations were made by people from all over mainland China, with booths set up in schools, at banks, and around gas stations. People also donated blood, resulting in according to Xinhua long line-ups in most major Chinese cities. Many donated through text messaging on mobile phones to accounts set up by China Unicom and China Mobile By May 16, the Chinese government had allocated a total of 772 million for earthquake relief so far, up sharply from 159 million from May 14.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The convenience of donating money in the aftermath of the earthquake was made possible by several entities and innovations. The Chinese government played an instrumental role in making these donations convenient, through the allocation of large funds dedicated to earthquake relief. They were able to increase relief funds from 159 million on May 14th to a whopping 772 million just two days later, showing their commitment and aid in mobilizing resources for disaster response and relief. Banks across mainland China also contributed by setting up booths around their vicinity and other high-traffic areas such as schools, and gas stations, providing easy access for people to make their donations. This allowed for a decentralized, yet cohesive response towards facilitating the monetary contributions from the public. Telecommunication companies, China Unicom and China Mobile, revolutionized the donation process by setting up accounts that allowed people to make donations through text messages on their mobile phones. This not only gave individuals the ability to make donations from virtually anywhere but also catered to a growing tech-savvy audience that prefers digital transactions. This convenient and novel method of donating resulted in a surge of donations. Additionally, the general population contributed to the convenience of the donation process. Many individuals willingly donated their time and effort by queuing up to donate blood at various cities across China. Their participation showcases a strong communal gesture of solidarity and empathetic response. Furthermore, the Chinese news agency - Xinhua helped in spreading the word and encouraging donations through their comprehensive coverage on the effects of the earthquake and how donations were making a difference. Overall, it was a collaborative effort from the Chinese government, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, the Chinese populace, and news outlets that made the process of donating money convenient during this time. Technology played a pivotal role in this process, enabling people to make contributions quickly and conveniently, therefore maximizing the overall donation amount that was utilized for disaster relief. This multi-faceted approach helped to ensure that aid was distributed efficiently and effectively to those most affected by the earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused.

Ruven Afanador/Corbis Outline      Check out an excerpt from the 5,000-word piece below, and pick up the October issue to read the entire interview with Justice Ginsburg. And as a bonus, youll also find the story of one of former ACLU lawyer Ginsburgs important early clients, Susan Struckan Air Force nurse who was offered a stark choice when she got pregnant: quit the military or have an abortion.      Youve said that the symbol of the U.S. shouldnt be an eagle but a pendulum. It seems to me that the pendulum has swung in a very conservative direction for womens rights, but not for gay rights. Why?      To be frank, its one person who made the difference: Justice [Anthony] Kennedy. He was a member of the triumvirate used to [reaffirm] Roe v. Wade in the Casey case, but since then, his decisions have been on upholding restrictions on access to abortion.      The first time you argued before the Supreme Court as a lawyer was in 1973, on behalf of Sharon Frontiero, an Air Force lieutenant who sued because under military rules she had to prove that her husband was dependent on her to get housing and medical benefits for him. [Servicemen, meanwhile, were automatically granted benefits for their wives.] What was it like to stand before the justices?      I had, I think, 12 minutes, or something like that, of argument. I was very nervous. It was an afternoon argument. I didnt dare eat lunch. There were many butterflies in my stomach. I had a very well-prepared opening sentence I had memorized. Looking at them, I thought, Im talking to the most important court in the land, and they have to listen to me and thats my captive audience.      And then you relaxed?      I felt a sense of empowerment because I knew so much more about the case, the issue, than they did. So I relied on myself as kind of a teacher to get them to think about gender. Because most men of that age, they could understand race discrimination, but sex discrimination? They thought of themselves as good fathers and as good husbands.      Do you think the pendulum might swing back in a more progressive direction on womens rights in your lifetime?      I think it will, when we have a more functioning Congress.      What do you make of the term activist judge?      Depends on whose ox is being gored. You think of activism, Congress is supposed to make the laws. So, it passed a campaign finance law. This court says, No, Congress, you cant do that. This court is labeled conservative, but it has held invalid more statutes than most courts. Thats why I say that activism is like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So the answer to the question: If a judge is called an activist, you know the person saying that doesn't like the decision.      Its part of Washington lore that you and Justice Scalia are good friends and opera buddies. I have to ask, when he says that the Constitution doesnt necessarily prohibit discrimination against women, isnt it hard not to take it personally?      Justice Scalia and I served together on the DC Circuit. So his votes are not surprising to me. What I like about him is that hes very funny and very smart.      [She points to a photograph.] That one shows the two of us in 1994 when we were on a delegation to India. So there we are on a very elegant elephant. My feminist friends say, Why are you riding on the back of the elephant? and I said, Because of the distribution of weight, we needed to have Scalia in the front.      Does it make a difference having three women justices?      Yes, an enormous difference .When Sandra left, I was all alone . Now Kagan is on my left, and Sotomayor is on my right. So we look like were really part of the court and were here to stay. Also, both of them are very active in oral arguments. Theyre not shrinking violets. Its very good for the schoolchildren who parade in and out of the court to see.      I know you can't comment on upcoming cases, but I've been reading about Young v. United Parcel Service, and I was wondering why you think pregnancy discrimination is still an issue.      I don't know why, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act passed in 1978. It was just like the reaction to Lilly Ledbetter: This court said that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex. How could you reach that conclusion? \\"Well, it only happens to a woman, so that's why it can't be discrimination on the basis of sex.\\" So Congress passed a law that simply said, \\"Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is discrimination on the basis of sex.\\" So the case you mentioned, this was a woman whose doctor told her she couldn't lift more than, I think, 20 pounds. For people who were temporarily disabled, the employer would make an accommodation, but the employer said, \\"We're not making an accommodation for her because she's not disabled.\\" [Due to UPS's denial, the employee, Peggy Young, had to take unpaid leave and lost her medical coverage for childbirth expenses.]      Fifty years from now, which decisions in your tenure do you think will be the most significant?      Well, I think 50 years from now, people will not be able to understand Hobby Lobby. Oh, and I think on the issue of choice, one of the reasons, to be frank, that theres not so much pro-choice activity is that young women, including my daughter and my granddaughter, have grown up in a world where they know if they need an abortion, they can get it. Not that either one of them has had one, but its comforting to know if they need it, they can get it.      The impact of all these restrictions is on poor women, because women who have means, if their state doesnt provide access, another state does. I think that the country will wake up and see that it can never go back to [abortions just] for women who can afford to travel to a neighboring state      When people realize that poor women are being disproportionately affected, thats when everyone will wake up? That seems very optimistic to me.      Yes, I think so . It makes no sense as a national policy to promote birth only among poor people.      When it comes to abortion rights, does the pendulum have to swing in a more conservative direction before it starts to swing back?      No, I think it's gotten about as conservative as it will get.      Im not sure how to ask this, but a lot of people who admire and respect you wonder if youll resign while President Obama is in office.      Who do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have? If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court. [The Senate Democrats] took off the filibuster for lower federal court appointments, but it remains for this court. So anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, theyre misguided. As long as I can do the job full steam . I think Ill recognize when the time comes that I cant any longer. But now I can.      If you were going to start a womens-rights project today like the one you started at the ACLU in the 70s, what would be the issues on your agenda?      Well, they wouldnt be what ours were. We had clear targets. That is, we wanted to get rid of every explicitly gender-based law, and the statute books were riddled with them, federal and state. Now discrimination is more subtle. Its more unconscious. I think unconscious bias is one of the hardest things to get at. My favorite example is the symphony orchestra. When I was growing up, there were no women in orchestras. Auditioners thought they could tell the difference between a woman playing and a man. Some intelligent person devised a simple solution: Drop a curtain between the auditioners and the people trying out. And, lo and behold, women began to get jobs in symphony orchestras. When I told this story a couple of years ago, there was a violinist who said, But you left out one thing. Not only do we audition behind a curtain, but we audition shoeless, so they wont hear a womans heels coming onstage.      Then these other things: How do you have a family and a family life and a work life? So some people are writing about Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan and saying to rise to the top of the tree in the legal profession, you have to forgo a family. Where are these people? What about Justice OConnor? She had three sons. I have two children. Pat Wald was with me on the DC Circuit and had five children.      Your husband, Martin Ginsburg, was a tax-law expert and Georgetown professor. I know you married him a few days after you graduated from Cornell in 1954he seems unusual among men of his generation. How did that make a difference in your career?      I met Marty when I was 17 and he was 18. He was the only boy I had ever met who cared that I had a brain. In the 50s, too many women, even though they were very smart, they tried to make the man feel that he was brainier. It was a sad thing. Marty had a wonderful sense of humor. He thought that I must be pretty good, because why would he decide that he wanted to spend his life with me? He always made me feel like I was better than I thought I was. He was so confident in his own ability that he never regarded me as any kind of threat. He also decidedand I was very lucky about thisthat when my daughter was born, he read something that said the first year is very important, thats when the childs personality gets formed, so he spent a lot of time with my daughter when she was a baby.      This is an excerpt from the October 2014 issue of ELLE. To read the full interview, get your copy now, available at newsstands nationwide.      This story has been updated to reflect the following change: \\"[The Senate Democrats] took off the filibuster for lower federal court appointments,\\" not the Senate Republicans, as previously written. ||||| Without Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court would likely be a less progressive and almost certainly a less lively venue. It’s almost unimaginable to think of oral arguments without Justice Ginsburg jumping in quickly and often to pepper lawyers with questions.      Yet—as I’ve said before—I was hoping that come the first Monday in October, when the Supreme Court starts its new term, we would see a new face on the bench in Ginsburg’s place. And I say this with all the respect due to a woman who has been a pioneer on and off the bench.      But that’s not going to happen. In an interview with Elle magazine published this week, Ginsburg reiterated her intention to stay, saying, “anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they’re misguided.”      Let me explain why I believe that Ginsburg’s calculations are wrong and could end up hurting her legal legacy on the court.      In deciding when to retire, Ginsburg, who is the eldest among the nine justices, should maximize the chance that her successor will be someone with her values and views. In March of this year, I wrote an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times urging her to resign at the end of the term. My argument was that only by allowing President Obama to replace her in the summer of 2014 would there be a sufficient likelihood that someone of similar ideology would take the place of the 81-year-old justice.      If Ginsburg—nominated in 1993 by President Clinton—had stepped down this past summer, President Obama could have had virtually anyone he wanted confirmed. There is a clear Democratic majority in the Senate and little history of filibustering Supreme Court nominees. Besides, if Republicans tried a filibuster, the Senate could abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court justices, just as it did last year for lower federal court judges and presidential appointees to federal agencies.      But there is a significant chance that the Republicans will take the Senate in November. If they do, President Obama’s choices for the high court will be greatly constrained. There is no chance that a Republican Senate will allow a progressive, or even someone slightly progressive, to be confirmed. None. If a Republican wins the White House in 2016, then the soonest Ginsburg could be replaced by a Democratic president would be 2021, when she will be about to turn 88 years old.      Over the last few decades, most Supreme Court justices have left the bench in their early 80s. Lewis Powell, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and Byron White all left soon after their 80th birthdays. Occasionally, justices have resigned sooner; David Souter did so just before his 70th birthday and Sandra Day O’Connor was 75 when she stepped down. John Paul Stevens was 90 when he left the bench.      My op-ed urging Ginsburg to retire attracted a great deal of attention, including from the justice herself. In countless interviews, she said that she had no intention of leaving the bench, sometimes specifically mentioning me by name in saying that she disagreed with those who were calling for her to step down. She elaborated in the Elle interview. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In an interview with Elle magazine, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg discusses her views on women's rights, her experiences as a lawyer and judge, and the reasons she believes the pendulum will swing back towards a more progressive direction on women's rights.

Summarize the following: Lay a mat or old sheet down on the ground to protect the seat and bars from dirt and scuff marks if you've turned it upside down. Make sure you are in an open, well-ventilated area that can get wet without ruining anything. You don't want to blast any of the dirt away, you simply want to wet the bike and remove and loose dirt and grime before you start scrubbing. Never use a high-pressure hose or nozzle setting. This can force water into your components, causing internal rusting or de-lubricating important junctions. If you desire, you can also add a bike specific cleaner, but avoid using ordinary dish soap as it typically contains salt which can corrode parts of the bike, including the frame. You will want to use a different bucket and sponge than the ones used for your drivetrain. Grease from the chain and cassette will get on your frame if you don't use fresh supplies, ruining your clean-up job. You want to get into those as much as possible and you need to get on the inside of the frame with your sponge. The wheels make it difficult to clean the parts of the bike closest to the ground and tire, which are often the dirtiest areas. The tires, which will become dirty again the second they touch the road, do not need to be cleaned. But the metal rim of the wheel can pick up gunk that gets in the way of your breaks. Use the abrasive side of a sponge to clean off the edges and lightly wipe down each spoke so your bike looks clean and sparkly.   Use a toothbrush to scrub the hub-- the small cylinder in the center of the wheel -- and the nuts and bolts on either side of it. If you want to clean your tires, or you see large chunks of mud in the treads, use a big, heavy bristled brush (like the one sold with a dust pan) to clean them quickly and painlessly. The rear cassette is the collection of gears on the back of the bike. While you cleaned it briefly when you cleaned the drivetrain, you should take the time to make sure it is spotless when doing a full bike cleaning. Drip some soapy water into the cassette, then use a clean rag to \\"floss\\" in between each of the gears and remove any extra gunk built up deep in the cassette. Summary:","output":"When you want to clean your bike, first put a mat or sheet on the ground to protect it. Make sure you're in an open, wet-friendly place. Just wet your bike, but don't use too much pressure because it can cause problems. Use special cleaner, but not regular dish soap because it can hurt your bike. When cleaning, use different buckets and sponges for the frame and the chain parts to avoid mixing dirt. Clean all the areas, including the hard-to-reach ones. The tires don't need cleaning, but the metal rim does. Use an old toothbrush for small parts. For the gears on the back, use soapy water and a clean rag to make sure they're really clean."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

The first sentence - Mel Gibson's passion-stirring Biblical epic \\"The Passion of Christ\\" will open in the United States on Feb. 25 - Ash Wednesday on the Roman Catholic calendar - provides information on the film's release date in the United States. This sentence states that the film will open on February 25 (Ash Wednesday on the Roman Catholic calendar), indicating its scheduled premiere.

Article:In his time in this country, with Falkirk, Hibs and Celtic, he's had 190 starts (plus 38 appearances off the bench). He has scored 114 goals (just six of those were penalties) and assisted in 64 others. It is rare that a guy with that kind of artillery in his locker becomes available on loan in the Premiership, but he's up for grabs until the end of the season. Given those numbers, no wonder that Mixu Paatelainen's tongue has been hanging out of his head for a few weeks. Stokes is precisely the kind of player he needs if Dundee United are to stage any kind of act of defiance at the bottom of the Premiership. Up in Inverness, John Hughes hasn't so much fluttered his eye-lashes in Stokes' direction as give him the full come-hither routine. Stokes is not returning his calls, so Hughes has been left to do his serenading in public. It has been a bit desperate, but entirely understandable because Hughes knows better than anybody what Stokes can do for his team. Hughes has applied the defibrillator to Stokes' career on two separate occasions - when he took him on loan from Arsenal to Falkirk and when he signed him for Hibs after the striker had endured joyless spells at Sunderland and on loan at Sheffield United and Crystal Palace. Hughes' management worked wonders on Stokes - and Stokes worked wonders for Hughes - and it was on his watch at Hibs that the striker got his big move to Celtic. The Dubliner owes the Inverness manager a lot, the least of the debt being the returning of a phone call. Stokes is bound for Easter Road and the care of Alan Stubbs. It could prove a good move because Stubbs looks like the kind of manager who understands how to deal with players who have a pretty loose interpretation of what it is to be a good pro, on and off the pitch. He has turned Jason Cummings around and if Stokes is ready to listen then he might well do the same for him. Stokes is just 27 - old enough to know better but young enough to have some fine years left in him if he can get himself on track. The player has clouds on his horizon that he needs to clear. He faces a trial in Dublin on charges of an alleged assault on an Elvis impersonator at a nightclub in the city in June 2013. His ability to score goals in Scotland is beyond question. His judgement in other areas of his life is far less certain, however. As a footballer, he has a future but only if he can rid himself of the attitude that has seen him fail to kick a ball for Celtic since late August. The sight of Nadir Ciftci and Carlton Cole ahead of him in the pecking order at Parkhead should both embarrass and inspire him. In ability terms, he's better than the pair of them and nearly everybody at the club would accept that. It's what's termed \\"the other stuff\\" that has held him back. Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon first mentioned \\"the other stuff\\" more than three years ago and the fact that we're still talking about it now shows that Stokes is slow to learn his lesson. To avoid the grim prospect of looking back on his career with a ton of regret the player needs to start making better decisions, on the pitch and off. He looks to have made a good one in committing to Hibs for the rest of the season. Everybody knows that he has the talent to be a success (again) in Edinburgh. It's his temperament that will be on trial in the coming months. A narrative is steadily building up around Hearts' style of play. It's euphemistically called \\"robust\\". That's the way Mark McGhee, the Motherwell manager, termed it on Friday. McGhee - hardly a delicate flower in his own playing days - might well have meant it as a compliment, but on the back of comments last week from Jonny Hayes of Aberdeen and, before that, Murray Davidson of St Johnstone, it added to a picture of Hearts as the Premiership's pre-eminent cloggers. Davidson went even as far as quoting the number of fouls Hearts were supposed to have committed in their five games before they met St Johnstone last month. He reckoned it was about 70. The image of the St Johnstone boys sitting in front of the television with their notepads counting the indiscretions is an amusing one. You might say that whatever Hearts are doing, or not doing, they've definitely got into the heads of their nearest rivals for second place in the league. The notion of Hearts as bully boys who muscle their way to victory is a distortion. They're physical, of course. Why shouldn't they be? They have some big men mixed in with some wee guys. What's wrong with that? They're hungry, as evidenced in their first half against Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup last weekend. That was a thunderous opening 45 minutes from Robbie Neilson's team. Throughout the match they looked like a side who wanted it more than the Dons and who were prepared to work harder for it. Do they take it to the edge sometimes? Of course. What supporter of any team in the world wouldn't want their players to show such commitment. But they can play. Let's not be daft. The feeling here is that there's more improvement in this Hearts team, but right now, only Celtic have scored more goals in the league than Neilson' side. You can do anything you like with statistics, but in terms of yellow cards dished out in the Premiership this season, Hearts have two players on the list of the top 20 whereas Hamilton and Kilmarnock have three. Their foul count - if it's higher than the rest - can be an illustration of their desire. The sight of a few of their rivals passing comment on it is an indication that they're rattling a few cages. That's no bad thing either. When Bernard Higgins, assistant chief constable of Police Scotland, urged football fans in this country to report anything that makes them feel \\"uncomfortable\\" at matches it might have taken about a minute - if that - for people to start taking him up on the offer. Had he given details of a hotline then the thing would have been jammed from now until eternity with justified complaints (some against the police force itself, no doubt) and others of a somewhat less serious nature. \\"Our back four make me very uncomfortable, sort it!\\" Higgins made the point, as many have done before him, that he'd like to see football fans reporting unsavoury behaviour in real-time. If they see somebody with flares, attract the attention of a steward or the police. If they hear sectarian singing, do the same. There is more than an element of \\"Do as we say, not as we do\\" about this. Did it really require fan intervention to identify the buffoons in the Celtic support who set off smoke bombs at Stranraer last weekend? No. Did it really require a disgusted Celtic fan to point out the morons who sang about the IRA in the same match? No, it didn't. If the stewards were paying attention they would have seen and heard it for themselves and would have done what the assistant chief constable is now asking football fans to do. Namely, telling the miscreants to behave - or else. Similarly at Ibrox, where many, many thousands sang The Billy Boys during Rangers post-Christmas game against Hibs at Ibrox. Are the police seriously saying that they needed embarrassed Rangers fans to tell them what was going on? There is an element of buck-passing. Traditionally, the Scottish FA and the SPFL (and before them, the SPL) have done absolutely nothing about sectarian chanting. No fines, no suspensions, no point deductions, despite the SFA saying, years back, that they wanted a policy of heavy punishment for repeat offenders. Stewards and police routinely stand by and allow \\"uncomfortable\\" behaviour to unfold, reluctant, understandably, to go in amongst the fans to stop it. The assistant police constable is now asking the fans to do, more or less, the job that others are there to do. Any supporter would be brave - and would be commended - if they reported unruly behaviour on the spot, but it's not their responsibility. That lies with the people running the game, not those paying to go and watch it. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Sure! This article talks about two main things. 1. The first part is about a footballer named Stokes who once played very well for several teams like Falkirk, Hibs, and Celtic, but he has some problems right now. He's been in trouble and has not been playing as much. Now, he has an opportunity to improve and play for another team because a man named Alan Stubbs might coach him. The article mentions that Stokes needs to make better choices, both during games and in his life outside football, including his behaviour. 2. The second part talks about a football team called Hearts. Some people say they play too rough or commit too many fouls, but the article suggests this might just be because they play with a lot of desire and work really hard. They're also doing quite well because they've scored a lot of goals, only beaten by Celtic. 3. At the end, it discuss about fans behaviour during football matches.

Recorded originally by Willie Mae \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton on August 13, 1952, in Los Angeles and released by Peacock Records in late February 1953, \\"Hound Dog\\" was Thornton's only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Context: \\"Hound Dog\\" (G2WW-5935) was initially released as the B-side to the single \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" (G2WW-5936) on July 13, 1956. Soon after the single was re-released with \\"Hound Dog\\" first and in larger print than \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" on the record sleeve. Both sides of the record topped Billboard's Best Sellers in Stores and Most Played in Jukeboxes charts alongside \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", while \\"Hound Dog\\" on its own merit topped the country & western and rhythm & blues charts and peaked at number two on Billboard's main pop chart, the Top 100. Later reissues of the single by RCA in the 1960s designated the pair as double-A-sided.  While Presley was performing \\"Hound Dog\\" on television and his record was scaling the charts, Stoller, who had been on vacation in Europe, was returning on the ill-fated final voyage of the Andrea Doria. On July 26, 1956, Leiber met the just-rescued Stoller on the docks and told him, \\"We got a smash hit on Hound Dog,\\" Stoller said, \\"Big Mama's record?\\" And Leiber replied: '\\"No. Some white guy named Elvis Presley.\\" Stoller added: \\"And I heard the record and I was disappointed. It just sounded terribly nervous, too fast, too white. But you know, after it sold seven or eight million records it started to sound better.\\" Leiber and Stoller tired of explaining that Presley had dropped most of their lyrics. For example, Leiber complained about Presley adding the line, \\"You ain't caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine\\", calling it \\"inane...It doesn't mean anything to me.\\" Forty years later, Leiber told music journalist Rikky Rooksby that Presley had stamped the hit with his own identity: \\"(A) white singer from Memphis who's a hell of a singer--he does have some black attitudes--takes the song over ... But here's the thing: we didn't make it. His version is like a combination of country and skiffle. It's not black. He sounds like Hank Snow. In most cases where we are attributed with rock and roll, it's misleading, because what we did is usually the original record--which is R&B--and some other producer (and a lot of them are great) covered our original record.\\"  By August 18, 1956, Peacock Records re-released Big Mama Thornton's original recording of \\"Hound Dog\\", backing it with \\"Rock-a-Bye Baby\\" (Peacock 5-1612), but it failed to chart. Question: How did the public receive the song ? Answer:","output":"The public really loved the song \\"Hound Dog.\\" When Elvis Presley sang it, it became very popular and many people bought the record. It was a big hit and reached the top of different music charts. People liked it so much that they played it a lot in places called jukeboxes, where you can choose songs to listen to. Even though it was originally sung by someone else, called Big Mama Thornton, it was Elvis's version that became super famous. Overall, the song was very well received and became one of the greatest songs of all time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Astronaut Soars-- Review: If there was ever a band collaboration that has been able to consistently create and record upbeat, danceable and recognisable material, it is Duran Duran. Astronaut seemed like a risky endeavor, as so many years had passed between these members' lives and common working situation. Seeing the band perform in July 2003, I realized how capable they were of turning back the clock. Astronaut proves that they can do more than recreate the past, as the new material compares with the best of their careers.Considering that Astronaut was self-produced makes even more of an impression, as no one had to be called in to make it happen. They seem to be of one musical soul, and I am so glad they have shared that again after all of these years. And being a male fan of 47 years of age, I am not a speaking as a heart-throbber, but as a true critic and aficiando of popular music... they have lost nothing! Astronaut shows a band in rare form, and better than ever. Answer: A:","output":"b). Yes The product review is positive.

The self-produced nature of the album is also acknowledged, highlighting the band's unity and talent. The reviewer, a male fan and a self-described true critic and aficionado of popular music, claims that Duran Duran has lost none of their charm over the years and that Astronaut showcases the band better than ever."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Now, let's analyze the story step by step: 1. When Oliver enters the hall, he knows the situation as it is. 2. Sophia enters the hall. Since there's no information about her being aware of the location of the apple, we'll assume she doesn't know about it. 3. The apple is in the blue_container. At this point, Oliver knows where the apple is originally placed, and Sophia does not know about the apple's location. 4. Oliver moves the apple to the blue_crate. Oliver is aware of this action, but there is no indication that Sophia witnessed the change in the apple's location. Now, let's identify the scenario: - It's not scenario 1 because Oliver's belief doesn't match reality. He knows where the apple is (blue_crate), but Sophia doesn't. - It's not scenario 2 because Oliver's belief is accurate - he moved the apple and knows its location. - It's scenario 3 because Oliver has a false belief about Sophia's beliefs.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

A  fireman saved a family when their car caught fire on the way to the airport - then gave them a lift to make sure they caught their flight. Phil Nelson spotted smoke and flames coming from a people carrier as he drove behind it up the M56 motorway. After using his flashing lights to pull them over, he single-handedly moved them to safety, directed traffic around from the fire - then drove them in his own car the rest of the way to Manchester Airport. Scroll down for video. Firefighter Phil Nelson, left, was driving behind the Renault Scenic carrying the unnamed family, right, to Manchester Airport when he saw the flames under the bonnet of their friends car. Luckily for the family, who were on their way to Hong Kong, Mr Nelson managed to get them and their luggage out of the burning car before it was completely engulfed in flames and then took them to Manchester Airport. Mr Nelson was returning from a firefighting conference where he met colleagues from Hong Kong. The family had been getting a lift from a friend to catch a flight for their holiday to Hong Kong when the grey Renault Scenic they were travelling in caught fire on the M56 eastbound carriageway. Mr Nelson was only driving back up the M56 because he had just been at North West Fire Control in Warrington meeting a delegation of firefighters - visiting from Hong Kong.

'First there was smoke coming out the engine, then flames started dropping down from it. 'I put my lights on to flash them to pull over and as soon as they stopped and oxygen pooled around the engine compartment, it went up in a flash. 'I was trying to ring it in to control and the family were trying to get all their luggage out the boot.' After rescuing the family, Mr Nelson, pictured, managed the scene until his colleagues arrived with a fire engine. He continued: 'I helped them with that, then got them back from the area, put my safety gear on and went to warn other motorists. 'I was trying to move cars from lane one when highway services arrived. 'The car was just a shell, but the family and their friend seemed quite positive - they were just happy they were all ok.

Pick from: * Pour the bacon slurry over cheesecloth in a bowl * Pour the bacon slurry over aluminum foil in a bowl","output":"The correct answer is: * Pour the bacon slurry over cheesecloth in a bowl Explanation: Imagine you have a bowl of juice mixed with pieces of bacon (which is the bacon slurry). To separate the juice from the bacon pieces, you need something that lets the juice pass through while holding back the bacon bits. A cheesecloth is a thin, mesh-like fabric that works like a strainer. When you pour the bacon slurry over it, the juice will pass through the small holes in the cheesecloth into the bowl below, leaving the bacon bits on top of the cheesecloth.  Aluminum foil, on the other hand, is a smooth, solid material that does not have any holes in it. If you tried to pour the bacon slurry over aluminum foil, both the juice and the bacon pieces would just sit on the foil without passing through, and you would not be able to separate them.

Summarize: Sir Richard Ottoway, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, accused the Chinese authorities of acting in an \\"overtly confrontational manner\\". His committee is examining relations between the UK and its former colony, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting since September. The demonstrators want elections free from interference by Beijing. Sir Richard said he had been warned that if he and fellow MPs attempted to travel to Hong Kong as part of the inquiry they would be refused entry. \\"The Chinese government are acting in an overtly confrontational manner in refusing us access to do our job,\\" he stated. Sir Richard added that he would request an emergency Commons debate on the issue. He told the BBC the committee intended to explore business, cultural and educational links between the UK and China, as well as the protests. \\"We are not China's enemies. We are friends and partners. We have every intention of going there in a sensible way,\\" he said. Sir Richard added: \\"The real worry about this is that it sends a signal about the direction of travel that China is going on Hong Kong. Immigration is a devolved matter to the Hong Kong authorities, and it's not for China to ban them.\\" The committee will continue with the probe, he said. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the committee was independent of government and described the Chinese decision to refuse members entry as \\"regrettable\\". The spokesperson added: \\"It is not consistent with the positive trend in UK-China relations over the past year, including the recognition during Premier Li's visit to London in June that the UK and China have considerable shared interests in respect of Hong Kong. \\"Nor is it in the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, concluded 30 years ago. The FCO has signalled this position to the Chinese at the most senior levels.'' Chinese authorities condemned the committee's inquiry when it was announced in September. The Chinese Foreign Affairs Committee charged its UK counterpart with carrying out a \\"highly inappropriate act which constitutes interference in China's internal affairs\\". But when the Commons committee took evidence from Lord Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, earlier this month, he criticised British politicians for not doing enough to support democracy there. Lord Patten said the terms of the 1984 Joint Declaration between the UK and China, agreeing the transfer of sovereignty to China and setting out a \\"one country, two systems\\" principle of governance, explicitly gave the UK a \\"legitimate\\" interest in Hong Kong's future. \\"When China asserts that what is happening in Hong Kong is nothing to do with us, we should make it absolutely clear both publicly and privately that it is not the case,\\" he said. Summary:","output":"Sir Richard Ottoway, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, has accused the Chinese authorities of being confrontational in their refusal to allow UK MPs to investigate relations between the UK and Hong Kong.

It is understood that Llewellyn was unhappy with the angle Waterhouse was taking on a story. Llewellyn apparently threw Waterhouse against a wall and tore his shirt. Lllewellyn has reportedly been under immense pressure at the station since budget cuts were made. Article:","output":"Title: Newsroom Brawl: Seven's Sunday Night Executive Producer Under Immense Pressure Amidst Budget Cuts In an unusual turn of events at the newsroom, chaos indulged the air as Mark Llewellyn, Executive Producer of Seven's popular Sunday Night show, allegedly got into a heated altercation with fellow producer, Paul Waterhouse. Based on reports circulating within the network, Llewellyn was seemingly unhappy with the angle Waterhouse proposed on a particular story, which led to the brawl taking place. Tensions were escalating as Llewellyn and Waterhouse discussed the focus of a story that was in development. Sources from the scene detailed how the executive producer suddenly became irate and proceeded to physically toss Waterhouse against a wall, resulting in Paul Waterhouse's shirt being torn in the process. It is worth noting that this confrontation did not transpire in a vacuum. In recent months, it has become increasingly evident that there's substantial pressure bearing down on those working within Seven Network, and Mark Llewellyn is no exception. Allegedly, ever since budget cuts were introduced at the station, Llewellyn has been under tremendous strain which could have played a significant role in influencing the explosive interaction that unfolded in the newsroom. The incident brings to light the impact that financial restrictions and changes can have on the workplace environment and the overall stress levels of employees. While physical altercations are undeniably rare and uncalled-for in a professional setting, such as a newsroom, these incidents do happen when individuals are pushed to their limits. This occurrence has led to discussions regarding effective and healthy outlets for stress that those in demanding positions can utilize, especially in the high-pressure world of media and journalism. In coping with such intense workloads and responsibilities, company culture should encourage and provide resources for proper stress-management, ensuring employees maintain their personal well-being and efficient productivity on the job. Furthermore, this newsroom brawl emphasizes the importance of a collective decision-making process within the news department. A difference of opinion on a story's angle should not result in violence or harm to any individual involved. Transparent communication and collaboration between team members are essential in not only fostering a healthy work atmosphere but also producing balanced and well-rounded stories for the audience. This unfortunate incident should serve as an important reminder for individuals and organizations alike to prioritize employee's mental health and positive workplace relationships. In the aftermath of this incident at the Seven Network's newsroom, the management should take the necessary steps to address the factors contributing to this kind of tension. Ensuring the well-being of all staff members, maintaining open communication channels, and establishing stress-management resources for all employees must become top priorities. By investing in measures to build a healthier and more supportive work environment, organizations can safeguard against the manifestation of conflicts amongst staff and ultimately improve the quality of its output. In conclusion, the recent newsroom brawl involving Seven's Sunday Night Executive Producer, Mark Llewellyn and producer, Paul Waterhouse highlights the multifaceted challenges that news organizations face, particularly when financial pressures compound the strain of productivity demands. These events offer an opportunity to review and enhance industry practices in proactively addressing stress, communication, and collaboration amongst teams. It is essential now more than ever, to learn from these incidents and foster a healthier, more successful industry for all involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fear Factory is an American heavy metal band that was formed in 1989. Throughout the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but re-formed a year later without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. Fear Factory was formed in 1989 under the name Ulceration, which the band agreed would \\"just be a cool name\\". In 1990, the name \\"Fear Factory\\" was adopted to reflect the band's new death metal sound, which was influenced by early British industrial metal, industrial music, and grindcore yet remained rooted in a conservative extreme metal approach; a facet of the band's music that resulted in its wider music audience appeal.  The band's origins can be traced to an outfit formed by guitarist Dino Cazares--formerly of The Douche Lords--and drummer Raymond Herrera in Los Angeles, California. Their first lineup was completed with the addition of bassist Dave Gibney and vocalist Burton C. Bell (ex-Hate Face), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheard him singing \\"New Year's Day\\" by U2. Cazares played bass on the first three Fear Factory albums Concrete, Soul of a New Machine and Demanufacture, on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone. Cazares created, wrote and recorded all the music on the album. Wolbers joined the band two weeks before they were scheduled to go on tour to promote the album and, although he contributed musical changes to a couple of songs on the album he stated that these were not significant.  Fear Factory's earliest demo recordings are strongly reminiscent of the early works of Napalm Death and Godflesh, an acknowledged influence of the band in the grindcore-driven approach of the former and the mechanical brutality, bleakness, and vocal stylings of the latter. According to Brian Russ of The BNR Metal Pages, the demos are remarkable for integrating these influences into the band's death metal sound and for Burton C. Bell's pioneering fusion of extreme death growls and clean vocals in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band's sound throughout their career. The use of grunts and \\"throat singing\\" combined with clean vocals later defined the nu metal and other emerging subgenres of metal. Many vocalists in today's metal scene use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics. The band contributed two songs to the L.A. Death Metal Compilation in 1990. The band played its first show on October 31, 1990.","output":"This text is about Fear Factory, an American heavy metal band that was formed in 1989."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jama Idle Ibrahim also pleaded guilty in a plea deal to a charge of conspiracy to use a firearm during a crime of violence, officials said. \\"According to the plea agreement, the parties agree that a 25-year sentence is appropriate,\\" a statement from the U.S. attorney's office said. No date was set for the sentencing on those charges. Ibrahim was among a group of Somali pirates who boarded and seized the Danish-owned cargo ship M/V CEC Future on November 7, 2008, the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement of facts. The pirates demanded and received an unspecified ransom and \\"stole money, food and supplies from the vessel,\\" the statement said. The pirates released the ship, cargo and crew after receiving the ransom in mid-January 2009. Ibrahim, also known as Jamaac Ciidle, pleaded guilty last month in a federal courtroom in Norfolk, Virginia, in another case, admitting he had intended to seize a U.S. merchant vessel on April 10 and hold it for ransom. Ibrahim and five other would-be pirates learned too late they had instead pulled alongside a U.S. Navy dock landing ship, the USS Ashland, and they were captured. A statement by the Justice Department said the government and defense agreed to recommend a sentence of 30 years in prison for Ibrahim in the Navy case. Sentencing was set for November 29. The attempted attack occurred in the Gulf of Aden between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Ibrahim is one of 11 Somalis sent to Norfolk for prosecution in two attacks. Five others are charged in connection with an April 1 attack on the Norfolk-based frigate Nicholas. As part of Wednesday's plea agreement, Ibrahim pledged to work with U.S. authorities on any future investigations.

In Germany, the Weimar Republic gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer Hall Putsch of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, economic development soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the \\"Golden Twenties\\".

Question: What law disallowed the public from attending executions in Missouri? Context: Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\" to \\"exclude public view.\\" For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, \\"the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.\\" The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not \\"public\\" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. The answer is:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about fish farming according to the United Nations report? A. Fish farming is growing at a rate of 2.5 percent a year. B. Fish farming now produces twenty-five percent of the world's supply of fish. C. Fish farming earned less money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. D. Fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year and now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pope Paul VI: Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of Roman Curia, revision of Canon Law, regulations for mixed marriages involving several faiths, and birth control issues. He opened the final session of the council, concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted. Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed. But all texts were finally agreed upon. The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. What does the Catholic church considered \\"mixed\\" in a \\"mixed marriage\\"?","output":"In the context of the Catholic Church, a \\"mixed marriage\\" refers to a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic person. This specifically means a marriage between a baptized Catholic and a baptized person who is not Catholic or a non-baptized person. The term \\"mixed marriage\\" highlights the religious differences between the spouses and implies that the couple comes from different faith traditions or backgrounds. The Catholic Church has traditionally held certain reservations regarding mixed marriages as they may lead to potential challenges for the couple, such as differences in beliefs, practices, and values, which can influence their married life and raising of children. To address these concerns, the Church has implemented specific regulations and guidelines for mixed marriages. For instance, the Catholic partner must promise to do everything in their power to ensure that their children are baptized and raised in the Catholic faith. The non-Catholic partner must be informed about the Catholic partner's promise and their obligation to raise the children Catholic. Additionally, both partners must receive proper spiritual preparation and guidance before entering into the mixed marriage, as well as agree to work to overcome any potential religious conflicts or misunderstandings. It is important to note that the reforms announced by Pope Paul VI between the third and fourth sessions as mentioned in the article sought to update and adapt these regulations in light of the changing social context and increased instances of mixed marriages involving different faiths. By addressing these issues, Pope Paul VI aimed to promote better understanding and cooperation between partners of different faiths, while also ensuring the preservation and growth of the Catholic faith within the family structure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Indianapolis scored on its first possession as running back Joseph Addai ran it in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 Colts. After two touchdown runs by David Garrard and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars took the lead in the second quarter, 14-7. Their lead didn't last very long as quarterback Peyton Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, tying the game at 14 heading into halftime. The Jaguars regained the lead in the third quarter with Garrard finding tight end Marcedes Lewis for a fifteen-yard touchdown pass. Jacksonville took the lead 21-14. Once again, the Colts responded when Addai scored on a two-yard touchdown run tying the game at 21. With 2:13 left in the game, Garrard completed it to Maurice Jones-Drew for an eight-yard touchdown pass and the Jaguars took a 28-21 lead.

Choices:  - kidney and gall bladder  - stomach and lung  - spleen and bladder  - pancreas and liver  A: A:","output":"The pancreas and liver are the two organs that secrete fluids that aid in digestion. The pancreas is a vital organ that is located in the abdominal cavity, behind the stomach. It has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine function is to produce and secrete pancreatic juice, which consists of digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions, to break down food into smaller, absorbable molecules. The main digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice include: 1. Amylase: This enzyme breaks down complex carbohydrates, like starch, into simple sugars such as maltose and glucose. 2. Proteases: They are responsible for breaking down proteins into their constituent amino acids. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are the primary proteases in pancreatic juice. 3. Lipase: It breaks down fats or triglycerides into simpler molecules, such as fatty acids and glycerol. In addition to the enzymes, bicarbonate ions in the pancreatic juice neutralize the acidic chyme (partially digested food) coming from the stomach, creating a more alkaline environment for optimal enzyme activity in the small intestine. The liver, located under the diaphragm and occupies the upper right portion of the abdomen, is the largest internal organ in the human body. It plays a crucial role in digestion, metabolism, detoxification, blood clotting, and other vital processes. One of the essential functions of the liver concerning digestion is the production of bile. Bile is a greenish-yellow alkaline fluid that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats. It contains bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, bilirubin, and electrolytes. Bile salts emulsify fats, breaking them into smaller droplets to increase their surface area, which allows lipase to work more efficiently. Furthermore, bile salts are crucial for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and dietary fats. After secretion, bile is transported to the gallbladder (a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver), where it gets stored and concentrated. When the presence of fats is detected in the small intestine, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile into the duodenum where it mixes with the food to begin the digestion of dietary fats. In conclusion, the pancreas and liver are the two organs that secrete essential fluids containing enzymes and substances like bile to aid in digestion. These secretions work in synergy to break down food into smaller molecules, allowing our bodies to absorb and utilize nutrients effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brittney Cason during her time with the Carolina Panthers before she switched to broadcasting. An ex-NFL cheerleader-turned-sports journalist almost became a victim of human sex trafficking at the Sochi Olympics when she was recruited for a reporting job that turned out to be bogus. Brittney Cason from Charlotte, North Carolina, was approached by a talent agent hiring U.S. reporters to cover the Winter Olympics last September. Writing on xojane.com, she explained how she became suspicious when - after a lengthy application process - the 'agent' asked her if she had any 'girlfriends' she could take with her, offering them visas with no interview process, eventually prompting action from the FBI. Ms Cason was contacted in September 2013 via her website by a man claiming to be a talent acquisition agent. 'Given my background in sports broadcasting...  and working on sports talk radio, it made sense he was recruiting me,' she wrote. Ms Cason was asked to submit examples of her work, and audition several times, before she was told that she had got the job with the network as a host and beat reporter for the games. In addition to Ms Cason, she was told that another legitimate sportscaster in North Carolina was hired to work alongside her. Her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was set to leave for Sochi, when the 'talent agent' said he needed to expand the coverage team and asked if she had any 'girlfriends' in the industry she could recommend. His assistant, who was actually just him, sent her documents for her friend to get a work visa. Brittney Cason said her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was due to leave for Sochi, when the 'agent' said he needed to expan the coverage team and asked if she had any 'girlfriends' she could recomment. Ms Cason says that so many of the trafficking stories she has heard started with someone being told they were hired for a modelling job. Ms Cason said: 'I spent four months applying and interviewing and he's sending my friend a work visa without even seeing her work? 'Now, my friend is really talented, but wanting her passport and social security number before her reel (reporting and presenting clips) just seemed fishy to me.' Ms Cason contacted the other sportscaster who was supposed to be going to Sochi with her and they investigated the talent agency further. She said: 'She and I concocted a plan to contact the production company in LA directly to check his credentials without stepping on his toes in the event we were just being paranoid.' Upon their investigation it turned out that the production company didn't know who he was, and advised them not to travel to Russia, and instead contact lawyers, who eventually contacted the F.B.I. Targeted by sex traffickers: Ms Cason said the man exerted a lot of effort to pose as legitimate and posed as a 'devout family man'. On the day she was supposed to leave, she was negotiating with her lawyers. Ms Cason remarked how she was shocked at the amount of effort the 'talent agent' had put in to the scheme. She said: 'The man exerted as much effort as a full time job to pose as legitimate - and never once crossed the line. 'Rather, he posed as a devout family man - We got the results back and suddenly needed the F.B.I.' On the day that she was set to leave, bags packed and flights booked, Cason was instead negotiating with her lawyers and the F.B.I, as it turned out that the 'talent acquisition agency' was most likely a front for a sex trafficking ring. The Olympic Games - including the winter games at Sochi - are a huge draw for trafficking: Aid workers said American women are typically sold for more in foreign countries. According to Jillian Mourning, founder of the non-profit All We Want is Love, a charity that attempts to help victims of human trafficking, it is common for men to pose as talent agents in order to lure and traffic women. Ms Cason said: 'So many of the stories I've heard from survivors start with \\"I was hired for a modelling job\\".' Mourning told her: 'The Olympics is a huge draw for trafficking. 'It's a major sporting event in a foreign country, and American women are typically sold for more in foreign countries.' Ms Cason added: 'Either way, this wasn't going to end well. 'Unfortunately I am not the daughter of Liam Neeson, so I wouldn't have had a happy ending had I gotten on a plane. 'For any young girl wanting to get into the business the first step is to seek a credible agent. 'If you have to pay money for an audition, that's a red flag for a business scam.'","output":"A former NFL cheerleader named Brittney Cason almost became a victim of human sex trafficking when she was offered a fake reporting job at the Sochi Olympics.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Unless your heart is set on vanilla, go with a chocolate icing. Starting with a brown-colored icing means you have to use less dye to achieve a black hue.  You can still start with a white icing, but you will probably have to add flavoring later to cover the bitterness of the dye. You can dye most icing--including buttercream, cream cheese, or royal icing--black by following these instructions. Because royal icing is white, you may need to add flavoring or cocoa powder to hide the bitter flavor. You may be limited to what they carry at your local grocery store, but if you have a choice between liquid or gel coloring, choose the gel. You will use less of the gel than you would the liquid coloring. If you cannot find black dye, mix equal parts red, blue, and green food coloring. You won't get the \\"true\\" black like you would from the store-bought black, but you can achieve a very dark gray that can pass for black. Adding the dye (especially liquid) may thin out your icing, which can lead to bleeding. Store-bought icing will probably be a fine consistency, as it is usually nice and thick.  To thicken, thoroughly mix in some sifted powdered (aka confectioner's) sugar.  If you don't want your icing any sweeter but it's not thick enough, add some meringue powder instead.  If you are using royal icing, drag a butter knife through the surface. Count how long it takes the icing to smooth back over. If it's between 5-10 seconds, your icing is thick enough. Any faster and you need to mix it longer or add a little sifted powdered sugar or meringue powder. The black dye may stain plastic. You may also want to wear an apron so you don't get any dye on your clothes. You will probably end up using a lot of dye--sometimes up to 1 oz or a teaspoon of coloring per cup--but it's better to add it gradually so you don't accidentally overdo it and end up with runny or splotchy icing.  Black icing can make your icing bitter and unpalatable. If this happens to your icing, look at section two (Addressing Common Problems) to learn how to cover the bitterness. If you are close to black but can't seem to get past a dark gray, give your icing a few hours to develop. The color will deepen over time, and in as little as one hour your dark gray icing can turn a rich, complex black.  The color will continue to deepen even once you've piped it onto a cookie or cake, so if you are super short on time you can go ahead and decorate immediately. Just be aware you won't have the opportunity to troubleshoot if the icing doesn't develop into the black you want.  Keep the icing out of direct light as it develops, as this can cause the black to fade.","output":"Choose chocolate icing to make black icing because it needs less dye. You can use different types of icing like buttercream or cream cheese, but white icing may need extra flavor to hide bitterness. Use gel coloring instead of liquid to mix with the icing. You can make a dark gray color by mixing red, blue, and green food coloring if you can't find black dye. Be careful with the dye because it can stain things. Add the dye slowly and give it time to turn black. Keep the icing away from direct light. If the icing tastes bitter, you can fix this, but try to start with chocolate icing to avoid that problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His inquiry leads him to encounter various obstacles and dangerous situations, including dealing with a powerful businessman, Orin Hanner Sr., played by Kris Kristofferson, who is involved in the criminal activity. The movie was generally perceived as unsuccessful by both critics and audiences. The four Golden Raspberry Award nominations \\"Fire Down Below\\" received were for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Steven Seagal), Worst Director (Felix Enriquez Alcala), and Worst Screenplay (Jeb Stuart and Philip Morton). These awards are presented as a satirical and humorous response to the prestigious Academy Awards, celebrating the worst of cinematic under-achievements each year.

Diverging in their culinary preferences, Cynthia and Felicia often saw their outings contrasted by the food they enjoyed. Where Cynthia had a flair for the robust flavors of Greek cuisine, complete with feta cheese, aromatic olive oil, and herbed chicken souvlaki, Felicia experienced comfort and an inexplicable delight in Chinese dishes, relishing the blend of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors that left her taste buds excited for more. On this particular day, they decided, as usual, to honor their individual tastes rather than compromising on a middle ground. After an hour-long debate over where to have lunch, they agreed to eat at a food court in a popular local mall, a place where both could get the kind of food they wished for. Felicia was delighted by the diversity of food stalls, her eyes keenly searching for her preferred Chinese eatery. As she scanned through the variety of food stalls, her eyes landed on a bustling Chinese place that promised to offer authentic delicacies. The sight of it, sizzling and fragrant, stirred her appetite instantly. She muscled her way through the crowd, anticipation coloring her features. Once at the counter, she was greeted with the invigorating smells of five-spice, soy sauce, and stir-fried veggies - a blend that was exclusively tied to Chinese cuisine. It was a sensory treat that had Felicia smiling in contentment. As her turn came, her choice was prompt and without hesitation. She ordered the sweet and sour chicken for lunch, a dish that she found inexplicably comforting. After collecting her order, she found a table and waited for Cynthia to join her. Felicia's lunch was a dance of flavors, the tender chicken cooked to perfection, lightly fried and tossed in a glossy sauce that whimsically balanced the sweetness and tanginess. Every bite was a celebration of texture and taste — the crunchy vegetables were a perfect contrast against the juicy pieces of chicken. The dish was served with steamed rice that absorbed the excess sauce, subduing the robustness just the right amount. Meanwhile, Cynthia, with her plate loaded with Greek delights, joined Felicia at the table. Despite their culinary differences, their common love for food made these diverse lunch outings special. They spent the afternoon appreciating the characteristics of their individual dishes, sharing stories and laughs. The day turned out to be an enjoyable feast, not just for their palates, but also for their hearts.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. the Quarter Quell finds them back in the arena, competing against other past winners. As if that weren't enough, there's also a love triangle, family drama, a score to settle, several districts to save and an uprising that can't be quieted. With evil monkeys and even more evil victors from previous games to battle, it's a lot for one movie to tackle, but the tributes in \\"Catching Fire\\" are more fully-formed characters, and they help set the story apart and keep the conflict interesting. Expert tip: These games are getting darker and sexier. Yes, the very premise of kids fighting to the death for the public's amusement ensures that there's a dark thread throughout the entire story, but the look and feel of \\"Fire\\" is darker as well, with new director Francis Lawrence amping up the action and suspense. And while costume designer Trish Summerville didn't allow tributes to be nearly nude as in the books, she did pull some form-fitting designer duds for them to wear. The fandom is growing up, and the movies are following suit. The big question: With several big names joining the cast, are there any new standouts? Sam Claflin shines as cocky tribute Finnick Odair, and Jenna Malone makes an equally splashy (and equally clothing-free) entrance as Johanna, who's good with an axe, but takes a bit to warm up to. Both have great moments with Katniss. 'Hunger Games' theme park? We have some ideas. The love triangle. HG 101: So there's this girl Katniss and she's a total badass, and she's basically best buds with the male version of her, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), but she gets sent off to the Hunger Games with Peeta, saves his life a million times and now all the viewers want them to be an item. So they sort of are. Besides fighting for basic survival, the Quarter Quell gives them more time together to explore their relationship, for real and for the cameras. The love triangle is what grounds the entire series in reality, and it ain't over until it's over, so don't expect anything to be decided halfway through the series' four-movie run. Expert take: Peeta might not be such a bad option for Katniss after all! Fans of the books were outraged that -- spoiler alert! -- Katniss ended up with Peeta after so clearly having a stronger connection with Gale. Peeta always seemed like too much of a damsel in distress for our Katniss, but in \\"Catching Fire,\\" Peeta is stronger and more independent -- and he can swim, so thankfully you won't have to see a near-drowning when they enter the water-filled arena. We wish he'd get a skill a little more exciting than painting his body with mud to be camouflaged, but we'll take any improvement on the character we can get. The big question: What about Gale? While Gale is once again on the sidelines for most of the movie, he does have a particularly haunting scene in \\"Catching Fire\\" that stays somewhat true to the book. The big difference? This time the changes leave the door open for Gale to really make his presence (and his intentions with Katniss) known in the two-part \\"Mockingjay\\" final installments. They've got Hemsworth -- they're going to use him! A brief history of young adult literature. The Capitol. HG 101: While the tributes from the districts must compete to take their next breath, residents of the Capitol are the 1%. Their excess knows no bounds, but they're still human. While they felt like caricatures in the first movie, \\"Catching Fire\\" reveals some chinks in the otherwise bedazzled armor, all thanks to Katniss and her act of rebellion that's now sparked a revolution. Expert tip: Yes, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is still the most stylish tribute sympathizer, but Effie Trinket is more lovable than ever. In \\"The Hunger Games,\\" Effie (Elizabeth Banks) epitomized everything the Capitol stood for: fashion, material things, excess and an obliviousness to the real issues in the districts around them. But as the stakes of the games are raised, so are Effie's concerns, and seeing cracks in her very colorful faÃ§ade helps make her more than a one-note character. We saw glimpses of her conscience in the books but, onscreen, Banks takes her from unemotional escort to compassionate cog in the wheel. The big question: Who's the new big bad? After the execution of \\"Hunger Games\\" gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), who ignored orders and let both Katniss and Peeta win, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) steps in -- and he's not going to make the same weak mistakes as his predecessor. With direct orders from President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make sure Katniss doesn't survive the 75th Games, he becomes the scariest new villain in the Capitol and the biggest potential threat. The role feels tailor-made for Hoffman. With the Panem rebellion in full swing, and Katniss as their poster child, there's more to prove in this 75th Hunger Games than ever before. Alliances will be tested and monkey mutts and Jabberjays will terrorize the returning victors, all while the clock is ticking to save their families, their districts and themselves.

Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803 - April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay \\"Nature\\". Following this work, he gave a speech entitled \\"The American Scholar\\" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America's \\"intellectual Declaration of Independence\\". Emerson was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 25, 1803, a son of Ruth Haskins and the Rev. William Emerson, a Unitarian minister. He was named after his mother's brother Ralph and his father's great-grandmother Rebecca Waldo. Ralph Waldo was the second of five sons who survived into adulthood; the others were William, Edward, Robert Bulkeley, and Charles. Three other children--Phebe, John Clarke, and Mary Caroline--died in childhood. Emerson was entirely of English ancestry, and his family had been in New England since the early colonial period.  Emerson's father died from stomach cancer on May 12, 1811, less than two weeks before Emerson's eighth birthday. Emerson was raised by his mother, with the help of the other women in the family; his aunt Mary Moody Emerson in particular had a profound effect on him. She lived with the family off and on and maintained a constant correspondence with Emerson until her death in 1863.  Emerson's formal schooling began at the Boston Latin School in 1812, when he was nine. In October 1817, at 14, Emerson went to Harvard College and was appointed freshman messenger for the president, requiring Emerson to fetch delinquent students and send messages to faculty. Midway through his junior year, Emerson began keeping a list of books he had read and started a journal in a series of notebooks that would be called \\"Wide World\\". He took outside jobs to cover his school expenses, including as a waiter for the Junior Commons and as an occasional teacher working with his uncle Samuel and aunt Sarah Ripley in Waltham, Massachusetts. By his senior year, Emerson decided to go by his middle name, Waldo. Emerson served as Class Poet; as was custom, he presented an original poem on Harvard's Class Day, a month before his official graduation on August 29, 1821, when he was 18. He did not stand out as a student and graduated in the exact middle of his class of 59 people.  In 1826, faced with poor health, Emerson went to seek a warmer climate. He first went to Charleston, South Carolina, but found the weather was still too cold. He then went further south, to St. Augustine, Florida, where he took long walks on the beach and began writing poetry. While in St. Augustine he made the acquaintance of Prince Achille Murat, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. Murat was two years his senior; they became good friends and enjoyed one another's company. The two engaged in enlightening discussions of religion, society, philosophy, and government. Emerson considered Murat an important figure in his intellectual education.  While in St. Augustine, Emerson had his first encounter with slavery. At one point, he attended a meeting of the Bible Society while a slave auction was taking place in the yard outside. He wrote, \\"One ear therefore heard the glad tidings of great joy, whilst the other was regaled with 'Going, gentlemen, going!'\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he have any siblings?","output":"Yes, Ralph Waldo Emerson had siblings.

Article: The Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law. The law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823, but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws. Naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide \\"conclusive evidence\\" that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948. The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as \\"among the world's least wanted\\" and \\"one of the world's most persecuted minorities.\\" But the origin of ‘most persecuted minority’ statement is unclear. Question: What races are considered to be the of the the national races in Burma ?","output":"In Burma, also known as Myanmar, the national races are recognized ethnic groups with specific rights and privileges. According to the 1982 Citizenship Law, there are eight main national races. These are: 1. Kachin: The Kachin people primarily reside in the Kachin State of northern Myanmar. They are comprised of several subgroups and mainly practice Christianity. 2. Kayah (Karenni): The Kayah people, also known as Karenni, inhabit the Kayah State in eastern Myanmar. They are made up of various subgroups, each with its own language and culture. 3. Karen: The Karen people predominantly live in the Karen State in southeastern Myanmar. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, with a diverse set of subgroups and languages. 4. Chin: The Chin people are found in the Chin State of western Myanmar. They belong to the Tibeto-Burman ethnic group and have multiple subgroups and dialects. 5. Burman: The Burman people, also known as Bamar, represent the largest ethnic group in Myanmar. They primarily reside in the central and lower regions of the country and predominantly speak the Burmese language. 6. Mon: The Mon people are an ethnic group in Myanmar, living primarily in the Mon State, Bago Division, and Irrawaddy Delta area. They have their own language and distinct cultural practices. 7. Rakhine: The Rakhine people inhabit the Rakhine State in western Myanmar. They are mainly Buddhists and speak the Rakhine language. 8. Shan: The Shan people are the largest ethnic group in the Shan State of eastern Myanmar. They have a diverse set of subgroups and languages. In addition to these eight main national races, there are a few minority groups within the Burmese population, such as the Kaman and Zerbadee. However, it is important to note that the Rohingya people, despite having resided in Myanmar for generations, are not recognized as one of the national races, leading to significant human rights abuses and exclusion from citizenship rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance.

Information:  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - Adrian Goodenough Hayter MBE MC ( 22 December 1914 -- 14 June 1990 ) was a New Zealand soldier , sailor , Antarctic leader and author .  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.

Q: Context: Islets from adult rat possess weak antioxidant defense leading to unbalance between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-inactivating enzymatic activities, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) rending them susceptible to oxidative stress. We have shown that this vulnerability is influenced by maternal diet during gestation and lactation.', 'The present study investigated if low antioxidant activity in islets is already observed at birth and if maternal protein restriction influences the development of islet antioxidant defenses. Rats were fed a control diet (C group) or a low protein diet during gestation (LP) or until weaning (LPT), after which offspring received the control diet. We found that antioxidant enzymatic activities varied with age. At birth and after weaning, normal islets possessed an efficient GPX activity. However, the antioxidant capacity decreased thereafter increasing the potential vulnerability to oxidative stress. Maternal protein malnutrition changed the antioxidant enzymatic activities in islets of the progeny. At 3 months, SOD activity was increased in LP and LPT islets with no concomitant activation of CAT and GPX. This unbalance could lead to higher hydrogen peroxide production, which may concur to oxidative stress causing defective insulin gene expression due to modification of critical factors that modulate the insulin promoter. We found indeed that insulin mRNA level was reduced in both groups of malnourished offspring compared to controls. Analyzing the expression of such critical factors, we found that c-Myc expression was strongly increased in islets from both protein-restricted groups compared to controls. Answer: Modification in antioxidant activity by maternal low protein diet could predispose to pancreatic islet dysfunction later in life and provide new insights to define a molecular mechanism responsible for intrauterine programming of endocrine pancreas.

Process:  - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person is on a ventilator happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of a person being on a ventilator does have an effect on the process of delivering oxygen to the body. A ventilator, also known as a mechanical ventilator or a respirator, is a machine that helps patients breathe when they are unable to do so on their own. This can be due to various reasons, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or other underlying medical conditions. The ventilator assists in the breathing process by controlling the volume and pressure of air that is provided to the patient. When a person is on a ventilator, it can help deliver more oxygen to the body by: 1. Ensuring a consistent and regulated flow of air into the lungs, which can maintain or increase the oxygen levels in the lungs, allowing for efficient gas exchange. 2. Controlling the respiratory rate and rhythm, which enables the lungs to fill and empty more effectively, leading to increased oxygen delivery to the red blood cells. 3. Reducing the work of breathing for the patient, allowing their body to focus on other vital processes, such as oxygen transport and cellular respiration. 4. Addressing any underlying issues that may be causing low oxygen levels, such as clearing mucus or secretions from the airways. So, the perturbation of a person being on a ventilator has a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body, potentially leading to more oxygen being available for use by the body's cells and tissues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them.

Write a title for this article: There is one unmistakably good piece of news on the budget deficit this election season, but self-proclaimed deficit hawks in the Republican Party have no grounds to boast about it: Since 2010, the pace of health care spending has fallen dramatically and with it, projected deficits over the next decade and beyond. The slowdown is evident in all major health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expected budget savings from 2015 to 2024 come to an impressive 1.6 trillion. Here’s the rub for Republicans. The savings have virtually nothing to do with the draconian deficit-reduction legislation they have muscled into law in the past several years, because those laws, thanks to Democratic resistance, left health care spending basically untouched. Rather, budget experts have attributed the improvement to a combination of economic and policy factors, including the beneficial interplay of private-sector and public-sector health spending under the health reform law. But beyond the improvement in health spending, the notion that today’s lower deficit represents economic progress — whether proclaimed by Republicans or Democrats — does not withstand scrutiny. Since 2010, Congress and the Obama administration have enacted four deficit-reduction measures, including budget caps and automatic spending cuts (the “sequester”) in 2011 and the “fiscal cliff” deal in 2012, which both cut spending and raised taxes. The laws have contributed to a steep decline in the deficit, from nearly 9 percent of the economy in 2010 to 2.8 percent in 2014. A rapid drop in the deficit, however, is precisely what the economy did not need. From 2011 until the middle of this year, deficit reduction actually reduced economic growth and employment below the levels they otherwise would have attained, because private sector investment and consumer spending were too soft and uneven to make up for premature budget tightening. The government sector is currently no longer subtracting from growth, but neither is it adding to it, in large part because constraints in the recent deficit-reduction laws prevent sizable federal investment in infrastructure, education and science. That lack of investment is a squandered opportunity to create jobs and lay the foundation for future growth. Failure to invest also foolishly squanders the opportunity to borrow prudently at today’s low interest rates for investments that could pay off for generations to come. Today’s lower deficit also relies much more heavily on spending cuts than tax increases, an indefensibly lopsided distribution of the fiscal burden. The deficit-reduction law from 2012 raised revenue by ending some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income Americans. Those changes were important to collect a fairer share of taxes from the upper reaches of the income ladder, and to help ensure that deficit reduction did not rely disproportionately on spending cuts to programs that benefit middle- and low-income taxpayers. Even with the tax increases, however, about three-fourths of the projected 4 trillion in legislated deficit reduction from 2015 to 2024 will come from spending cuts, while less than one-fourth comes from higher revenues. The budget deficit has come down, but at the expense of a more robust recovery. And future reductions will fall heavily on those less able to shoulder the burden. That is nothing either party should be proud of.

Article: It's not every week that England's greatest playwright William Shakespeare hits the headlines, but the Bard of Avon   has been the subject of two news stories in recent days as new information has come to light about the writer and his working environment. In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron   tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre. The site was excavated  by a team from the Museum of London last summer, and is believed to have been built in 1576. Experts think that Shakespeare himself acted at the theatre, which may have been where the play Romeo and Juliet was premiered  . It is believed that 25 years after construction, the building was pulled down and moved timber by timber to the South Bank of the Thames, where a reconstruction of the theatre now stands.

Answer:","output":"The popular pub name that comes from the title of John Manners is \\"The Marquis of Granby.\\" To provide a detailed and long answer, we first need to understand who John Manners was and why this pub name is associated with him. John Manners (1721-1770), also known as the Marquis of Granby, was a British soldier and nobleman who had distinguished himself in various military campaigns, particularly during the Seven Years' War between Britain and France (1756-1763). He was the eldest son of the 3rd Duke of Rutland and his wife, Bridget Sutton. Manners held the courtesy title of Marquis of Granby, which refers to a nobleman who is the eldest son of a duke in the British peerage system. This courtesy title was derived from the village of Granby in Nottinghamshire, where the Rutland family owned land. Marquis of Granby gained widespread respect and admiration for his bravery, leadership, and tactical skills during his military service. One of his most notable victories was at the Battle of Minden (1759), where he led British and allied forces to an unexpected victory against the French, which ultimately proved to be a turning point in the Seven Years' War. His military successes earned him a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General and Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Germany. Apart from his military skills, the Marquis of Granby was also known for his generous and compassionate nature, particularly towards his fellow soldiers. Upon retirement, he helped many of his former soldiers by providing financial support and setting them up with inns or public houses, where they could make a living after their military service had ended. This act of kindness further endeared him to the public. As a result of this generosity and his military distinction, the Marquis of Granby's name became synonymous with public houses and inns, leading many establishments to adopt the name \\"The Marquis of Granby\\" in his honor.

Liverpool opened the redeveloped Main Stand last month, raising capacity to 54,074, and have planning permission to extend Anfield Road by a further 4,800. But Ayre said: \\"A stand behind a goal doesn't have the benefit of hospitality that would go a long way to meet the redevelopment costs.\\" The upgrade would cost about £60-70m. Club owner John Henry has previously played down the prospect of the work going ahead on the basis ticket prices would have to rise to cover the cost. Liverpool are worried how fans would react after thousands of protested against plans to charge £77 for some tickets in the club's new Main Stand back in February. The £100m expansion of the Main Stand is expected to be paid off in six years because of the lucrative income generated by hospitality seating - but that is not the case with the Anfield Road end. \\"From a purely general admission perspective, building, say, 6,000 extra seats to take the capacity up to 60,000 would cost somewhere between £60m and £70m,\\" said Ayre, speaking at a meeting of the Liverpool Supporters' Committee (LSC). \\"At £12,000 to £13,000 per seat, it would take approximately 15 years to pay back, which is not a smart investment for the business.\\" Ayre told the meeting the club was open to fan investment to help fund further redevelopment of the ground and said conversations should take place.

Plot title: Night at the Museum Movie plot: Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is a divorced man who has been unable to keep a stable job and has failed at many business ventures. His ex-wife (Kim Raver) believes that he is a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick (Jake Cherry), and Larry fears that Nick respects his future stepfather, bond trader Don (Paul Rudd), more than him. Cecil Fredricks (Dick Van Dyke), an elderly night security guard about to retire from the American Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising rÃ©sumÃ©. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and two colleagues Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) with one guard. Cecil gives Larry an instruction booklet on how to handle museum security, and advises Larry to leave some of the lights on and warn him not to let anything \\"in...or out\\". Once night falls, Larry discovers that the exhibits come to life, including a living Tyrannosaurus skeleton nicknamed \\"Rexy\\" who behaves like a dog; a mischievous capuchin monkey named Dexter (Crystal) which steals Larry's keys and tears up his instruction booklet; rival miniature civilizations led by Old West cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and Roman general Octavius (Steve Coogan); limb-ripping Attila the Hun; an Easter Island Moai (Brad Garrett) obsessed with \\"gum-gum\\" who addresses Larry as Dum-Dum; and a wax model of Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams). Roosevelt explains that since an Egyptian artifactâthe Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Akhmenrahâcame to the museum in 1952, all of the exhibits come to life each night. If the exhibits are outside the museum during sunrise, however, they turn to dust. Roosevelt helps Larry by restoring order, but only for one night, and Larry decides to remain as a night guard.

News article: ‘Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates’ is filthy and hilarious Just as there’s room for more than one movie about superheroes, there’s room for more than one movie about attending weddings under false pretenses. The frankness in “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates” is refreshing: The characters even talk about how much they love “Wedding Crashers.” Who doesn’t? This time, there’s a sly difference: It’s the girls, Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza), who aren’t supposed to be there. They con their way into an elaborate destination wedding in Hawaii that they treat as an all-expenses-paid vacation. Both are trashy waitresses who contrive a meeting with two brothers, Mike and Dave Stangle (Adam DeVine, Zac Efron), who published a viral post seeking “nice girls” to be their dates for their sister’s wedding, their dad (Stephen Root) having chewed them out for constantly ruining previous family events they attended stag. Having female companionship, the reasoning goes, will civilize the anarchic young bros. Disconcerting as it is to see such shrewd actresses as Kendrick and Plaza play brainless skanks, they hit their marks with gusto and a little sweetness: In keeping with the overall vibe of seeming like a production of Judd Apatow’s slightly less thoughtful little brother, the picture (directed by Jake Szymanski of HBO’s “7 Days in Hell”) is as filthy as the back of a sanitation truck — but it has heart, too. Most of the comedy is funny, some of it is hilarious, and even the scenes that don’t really work (such as the bizarre nude massage that amounts to the centerpiece of the film) have so much crazy energy that you have to give them credit for the effort. Drugs, public nudity, unfortunate ATV accidents, a horny lesbian cousin and poorly aimed fireworks add to the vortex of nuttiness, but the movie also randomly comes up with clever insights like a bit on how men find schoolteachers attractive. In Tatiana’s case, though, she sounds a bit too honest to be the second-grade teacher she pretends to be: “The key to teaching kids is repetition,” she declares. “You’d be surprised how stupid they are.” Nor can Alice quite be believed when she says her ex died of cancer, AIDS and a plane crash. Some of the dumbest bits (and there are many) don’t fail completely because of the talents of the actors, especially DeVine, whose line readings throughout are sensational. And as befits a movie containing stars of “High School Musical” and “Pitch Perfect,” there is singing, not to mention wonderfully unpredictable little bits of random, seemingly improvised comedy: Consider the priceless line, “Once I got high on peyote and signed up for a T-Mobile plan.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article is a review of the movie \\"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,\\" describing it as filthy and hilarious.

Jennifer had recently moved to a new home and was rather anxious about creating a warm and inviting atmosphere in which she could not only entertain friends and family, but also find a comfortable sanctuary where she could unwind after a long day. As a true friend who genuinely cared about Jennifer's contentment, Rachel wholeheartedly decided to put her skills to good use and offer her assistance. When they first began discussing the project, Rachel saw just how much it meant to Jennifer and how dedicated she was to creating the perfect environment in her home. They spent a significant amount of time together sifting through fabric samples, discussing the color palette they believed would best suit the room, and determining the ideal measurements and design to ensure the curtains would make a true statement without overwhelming space. Not only was Rachel's knowledge in textile materials and sewing techniques immensely beneficial during their planning stage, but her keen eye for design further solidified Jennifer's trust in her friend's capabilities. As they moved forward, Rachel’s genuine enthusiasm for crafts and passion for lending a helping hand energized her throughout the entire process, making the curtain-making experience incredibly rewarding for both of them. As she began sewing the curtains, Rachel took the utmost care and attention with every stitch, knowing that her handiwork would directly impact the transformation of Jennifer's living room. As the curtains gradually took shape, she was filled with pride and satisfaction as she watched her vision come to life. Additionally, Rachel recognized that by sewing the curtains herself, she was also easing Jennifer's financial burden considerably. High-quality, custom-made curtains can be relatively expensive, and by providing her expertise and time, Rachel was able to cut down on the costs while ensuring that the final product was as beautiful and impressive as anything Jennifer could have sourced from a store. Having completed the curtains, Rachel eagerly delivered them to Jennifer's home and helped her hang them. The impact the curtains had on the living room decor was truly remarkable, emphasizing the color scheme and establishing a focal point that elegantly framed the windows. The gratitude on Jennifer's face and the sparkle of appreciation in her eyes when she beheld the transformation spoke volumes about the significance of Rachel's gesture.

News article: Parents, police monitoring kids' cell phones (CNN) -- One evening last winter, Mike Harris was watching his local TV news when he saw a segment that caught his attention: Parents were using software to monitor their kids' cell phones. As more kids carry cell phones, some parents use software to monitor their calls and texts. Harris, an investigator for the Child Sex Internet Investigations Unit in Jefferson County, Colorado, thought the service could be a new tool for combating sexual predators. Equipping his phone with the software, Harris posed as an underage child on social-networking sites and began luring pedophiles. He immediately got results. Since then, Harris has made 83 arrests of alleged sexual predators -- 44 of them with the help of the monitoring program. \\"It makes life easy for me as an investigator. It saves me hours of time, which obviously means I have more time to go out and catch offenders,\\" he said. The software also documents text messages and other data that can be used in court, he said. \\"Now all I have to do is go into the account and pull everything out that was done between that sex offender and me.\\" Programs such as My Mobile Watchdog and Mobile Spy are becoming increasingly popular with parents as more school-age children are carrying cell phones. Parents say the services help them protect their kids against predators and also reduce \\"sexting,\\" the growing practice of using mobile phones to share sexually explicit text messages and pictures. In 2008, Jessica Logan, a Cincinnati, Ohio, teen, hanged herself after her nude photo, meant for her boyfriend, was sent to teenagers at several high schools, exposing her to ridicule and taunts. The monitoring programs work like this: Once a child's phone is equipped with the software, the parent or law enforcement officer creates a list of contacts -- close relatives, trusted friends -- who are authorized to communicate with the minor's phone. An online file, accessed by the parent, stores all activity related to the child's phone, including text messages and shared photos. Any unauthorized number that contacts the child's phone gets flagged, and the parent or guardian receives a real-time text message alerting them to the infraction. Parents pay a monthly fee -- about 10 -- for the service, which only works on so-called \\"smart phones\\" with Web access. My Mobile Watchdog also will alert parents if their child has removed the software from their phone. eAgency Mobile Solutions of Newport Beach, California, is the creator of My Mobile Watchdog. Bob Lotter, the company's CEO, said he never imagined the software would become a tool for authorities cracking down on online sexual predators. \\"The threat is huge,\\" Lotter said. \\"There are so many different ways out there for child predators [to find victims] -- through Google, Yahoo, MySpace, Facebook and a host of other sites.\\" A Lakewood, Colorado, woman said she outfitted her 12-year-old daughter's phone with monitoring software after the girl was sexually assaulted by a man she met on MocoSpace, a mobile chat network. \\"I wasn't going to take away her cell phone, and I knew I had to do something,\\" said the woman, whose first name is Wendy. CNN.com is not printing her last name in accordance with its policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault. Wendy said the service has given her more peace of mind and her daughter a greater awareness of the responsibilities of having a cell phone. Other parents haven't been so transparent. James Green of Sulphur, Louisiana, equipped his daughter's cell phone with monitoring software but didn't tell her what it was. He told her the icon was a GPS system. \\"I wasn't going to get my 15-year-old a cell phone and not know how she was using it,\\" Green said. Over time, Green found the software wasn't just useful for tracking his daughter's behavior; it also helped him discover more about the nature of his child. \\"It's good to know how she's treating people and how others are treating her,\\" Green said. \\"I think it's a caring father that wants to know what's going on in her life ... wanting to know how she feels.\\" When Green's daughter discovered the software on her phone, she wasn't angry, he said. \\"She understood that I cared about her.\\" A Chandler, Arizona, mother found that monitoring her daughter's phone calls and texts gave her new insight into her daughter's life. \\"We talk a lot more about what's going on in her life,\\" said Trisha, who requested her last name not be published. \\"It's really opened up communication between the two of us.\\" Some privacy advocates might object to parents digitally eavesdropping on their kids without their children's consent. But an Asheville, North Carolina, mother, who fitted her son's phone with the software without his knowledge, disagrees. \\"I monitor my employees at the workplace,\\" said the woman, who owns a small business and asked that her name not be disclosed. \\"And this is my son. So to me it's not like I'm wiretapping him. Besides, privacy in my house is earned.\\" All About Cellular Phones • Sexual Offenses What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kyle Dalton Sandilands (born 10 June 1971) is an Australian radio host living in Sydney. He is currently the co-host, with Jacqueline Henderson, better known as Jackie O, of the weekday morning radio program The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Sydney's radio station KIIS 106.5. From 2005 to 2009, Sandilands served as a judge on Australian Idol. In 2008, he became the host of Big Brother, alongside Jackie O. Sandilands landed his first radio job in 1992, at age 21, at 4TO Townsville where he was employed to drive the station's promotional vehicle. Within weeks he had declared his willingness to do whatever it took to get ahead: to work anywhere, in any time slot. He took gigs in Cairns, and then Darwin, before joining Austereo's Triple M in a Brisbane station by using a false resume to impress one of the station's executives. In 1999, he moved to Sydney, and commenced at 2Day FM as host of the Hot30 Countdown, replacing \\"Ugly Phil O'Neil\\", a former husband of Henderson (Jackie O). Sandilands attributes his radio career taking off to being told by then Group Program Director Jeff Allis to \\"do whatever you want, just win\\". Sandilands revealed he was paid 255,000 per year while working on the Hot30.  Much media coverage of Sandilands has focused on the negative aspects of his personality and behaviour, notably his widely publicised clashes with and criticism of other media figures, his intemperate on-air outbursts and his alleged \\"out of control\\" ego. In September 2006, Sandilands was named the most hated Australian identity in a Zoo Weekly article, although on 14 October 2006, Sandilands and Henderson were named \\"Best On-Air Team\\" at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards. Sandilands and Jackie O were again named \\"Best On-Air Team\\" at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards in 2007, 2011, and 2015.  In August 2009, The Kyle and Jackie O Show was put into \\"indefinite recess\\" by the Austereo network as a result of a controversial on-air stunt on his morning show on 29 July 2009. He returned to his radio show on 18 August 2009 but was suspended on 9 September 2009 due to on-air comments relating to Magda Szubanski. In the same year he was again named the most hated by Zoo Weekly. Sandilands and Henderson were the hosts of the nationally syndicated chart show The Hot Hits, before swapping host roles with Andrew Gunsberg in December 2009, who had previously hosted Take40 Australia, but left the show at the end of 2011.

Second question: How do I stop giving a fuck about what others think of me? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's address each question individually, and then I will discuss whether they are essentially asking the same thing or not. Question 1: How can I stop giving a fuck about anything? To stop giving a fuck about anything, you can follow these steps: 1. Prioritize your values and beliefs: Determine what is truly important to you and cultivate the strength to focus on those areas. This will help you differentiate between things that matter and those that don't. 2. Accept imperfection: Understand that no one is perfect, including yourself. Embrace your flaws and focus on self-improvement rather than trying to meet unrealistic expectations. 3. Focus on what you can control: Develop a sense of agency by focusing on areas of your life where you have control. Avoid dwelling on things beyond your reach, as this only leads to negative emotions and futile efforts. 4. Practice detachment: Practice emotional and mental detachment from situations that are not important to your life. This will help you maintain a healthy perspective and avoid getting emotionally invested in things that don't really matter. 5. Build self-confidence: Strengthen your self-esteem by setting attainable goals, identifying your strengths, and celebrating your achievements. This will help you become more resilient to external influences that might otherwise sway your beliefs or emotions. 6. Develop a support network: Surround yourself with positive people who share your values and appreciate your true worth. This will provide a buffer against negativity and help keep you grounded. 7. Engage in activities that bring happiness and fulfillment: Find hobbies or interests that genuinely bring you joy, and invest in them. This will help you cultivate a sense of purpose and reduce the importance of less meaningful pursuits. 8. Manage stress: Practice healthy stress management techniques like exercise, relaxation strategies, or mindfulness practice, as stress can often make us become more emotionally vulnerable to external influences. 9. Cultivate gratitude: Focus on the positive aspects of your life and practice thankfulness. This will help you maintain perspective and recognize the less important aspects of your life to which you don't need to give a fuck. Question 2: How do I stop giving a fuck about what others think of me? To stop giving a fuck about what others think of you, you can follow these steps: 1. Recognize that you cannot please everyone: People have diverse opinions and preferences, and it's impossible to make everyone happy. Accept this reality and focus on doing what is right for you. 2. Value your own opinion: Develop a strong sense of self-worth and believe in your abilities. When you value your own opinion, the opinions of others carry less weight. 3. Understand that others have their own struggles: People who criticize or judge others often do so out of their insecurities or personal issues. Recognize that their opinions may not be based on objective truth but rather on their personal feelings. 4. Adopt a growth mindset: Be open to learning from your mistakes and use constructive criticism as an opportunity for self-improvement. This will help you focus less on others' opinions and more on your personal growth. 5. Limit exposure to negative influences: Distance yourself from people who consistently bring you down or cause you to question your self-worth. Surround yourself with positive, supportive individuals who uplift you and encourage your growth. 6. Maintain a sense of humor: Laugh at yourself and embrace your imperfections. Develop a light-hearted approach to life, and others' opinions will matter less. Regarding the third part of your question, the two questions are related but not identical. The first question deals with your overall mindset towards life and its many aspects, while the second question is specifically concerned with the opinions of other people. Although there is some overlap, they are not asking the same thing. By addressing the factors discussed in the answers above, you can effectively work on both developing a healthier outlook on life and minimizing the impact of others' opinions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded?  Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Tracy discovered that her cousin, Austin, was attending an ill reputable school and thus decided to bring him to a good school.  Given the question \\"What will Tracy want to do next?\\", is \\"ignore the issue\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"ignore the issue\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Tracy want to do next?\\" given the context provided. Since Tracy has discovered that her cousin, Austin, is attending an ill-reputed school, she has made the decision to bring him to a good school. Therefore, it is clear that Tracy is concerned about Austin's education and well-being, and wants to take action to improve his situation. Instead of ignoring the issue, Tracy will likely want to take several steps to ensure a positive outcome for Austin. Here's a detailed and long answer outlining what Tracy might want to do next: 1. Research and identify reputable schools in their area: To help Austin, Tracy will start researching good schools nearby. She might inquire about the curriculum, educational philosophy, faculty qualifications, and extracurricular activities offered. By doing so, she can find a suitable school that provides a healthy and nurturing environment for Austin. 2. Compare and evaluate the options: Having identified several reputable schools, Tracy would then assess and compare them based on criteria important to Austin, such as academic programs, size, location, and tuition fees. Tracy might also consider the needs and preferences of Austin to make sure the selected school suits him well. 3. Discuss the issue with Austin's parents: As Austin is a minor, Tracy should have a conversation with his parents and inform them about the situation. She could discuss her concerns about the ill-reputed school and present the better alternatives she has found. Ensuring they are on board with the idea of changing Austin's school is essential for a smooth process. 4. Visit the potential schools with Austin: Before making a final decision, it would be important for Tracy and Austin to visit the prospective schools together. This would give them a firsthand experience of the schools' environment and facilities, allowing them to make a more informed decision. During these visits, they could also ask questions to understand how the school functions and gauge if it will be a suitable environment for Austin. 5. Apply for admission: Once they've decided on the best school for Austin, the next step would be applying for admission. This might involve submitting an application, providing necessary documents, and going through an interview or testing process. Tracy may provide assistance and guidance to Austin during this process to ensure a successful transition. 6. Support Austin during the transition: Changing schools can be challenging for any student, and it is important that Tracy provides emotional support and reassures Austin during this time. She could help him with any schoolwork, encourage him to participate in extracurricular activities, and offer advice on making new friends. In summary, instead of ignoring the issue, Tracy will want to take a series of proactive steps to assist her cousin, Austin, in finding a good school and ensuring a successful transition. This includes researching and comparing schools, communicating with Austin's parents, visiting potential schools, guiding Austin through the application process, and providing support during the transition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose life is shaken up by the arrival of a child? ?  The film highlights three different stories. These stories unfold over the course of nine months. Two couples live completely opposite lives of each other, yet share one commonality: an unexpected pregnancy. The main characters, Carmine and Sasha live in a carefree and comfortable world and the arrival of a child shakes up their conventional life: behind their illusion of a fancy condominium and their successful careers hides a couple that is living in pain, secrets and lies. Simultaneously, the other couple within the film, Justine and Seb are freedom seekers that live day by day on the streets of Montreal. These two young squeegee kids live in hopes of a better future, but in the meantime seem to be content with part-time jobs; such as washing windshields and doing small-time deals. Justine's pregnancy catches Seb off guard as he is not ready to be a father. The history of violence in their relationship makes getting an abortion the obvious choice, however things worsen and turn out differently.

Manny","output":"Title: The Untamed Trail Genre: Adventure, Drama, Coming-of-Age Plot Summary: Set in the remote, untamed wilderness of northern Canada, our story follows the life of a large, strong and loyal dog named Buck. Born and raised on a cozy Californian estate, Buck is stolen by thieves and sold as a sled dog in the harsh and unforgiving North. He faces many challenges and hardships in his adjustment to this cruel and unfamiliar environment.  Manny, an experienced and ruthless sled dog trainer, becomes Buck's new owner. He has a well-established reputation for getting the best out of his dogs, though his methods are often cruel and harsh. He repeatedly asserts his dominance over Buck, believing that it is the only way for Buck to understand his place in the pack and become an effective sled dog. This power struggle forms the central theme of the movie as Buck navigates the brutal world of the North, torn between his innate pride and the submission demanded by his harsh owner. Manny's greatest source of pride is his lead dog, Rex, who is also subjected to Manny's dominance to maintain control - though not as harshly as Buck, who Manny sees as a potential threat. Buck and Rex's relationship is strained at first due to the constant competition for position and Manny's favor. They become reluctant allies in their struggle against Manny's control.  As the movie progresses, Buck and Manny face various tribulations, including treacherous trails and fierce blizzards that challenge not just their physical prowess but their emotional resilience as well. Buck slowly learns that there is strength in cooperation and that collaboration with his fellow sled mates, including Rex, can offer him a sense of belonging and purpose. In a particularly trying situation, they encounter a rival sled team that attempts to sabotage their progress. As a result, Rex suffers a severe injury, forcing Buck to take the lead. Buck quickly proves himself as a remarkable leader, guiding his fellow sled dogs through the treacherous conditions and working selflessly to ensure the team's success. Despite his many victories and growing bond with the team, Buck's relationship with Manny remains a contentious one. Manny's insecurities and refusal to admit Buck's potential keep them from finding a mutual understanding. Witnessing Buck's leadership and camaraderie with the other dogs, however, Manny slowly begins to question his own cruel methods. In the climax of the movie, Manny is confronted by a pack of unforgiving wolves while traversing a treacherous trail, putting the entire team in danger. Instead of abandoning Manny, Buck fights valiantly to protect both his team and the man who made his life miserable.  Seeing Buck's unwavering loyalty despite all that has happened deeply moves Manny. He realizes his harsh methods were uncalled for and that dogs like Buck possess the heart and courage to prevail without cruel oppression. Manny experiences a profound change of heart, and for the first time, he acknowledges Buck as his equal – a true leader and partner in their journey. The Untamed Trail ends on a poignant note, with Buck and Manny reconciled and forging an unbreakable bond where love and mutual respect replace the previous struggle for dominance. The wilderness, once hostile and cold, is now a place where they both belong – their journey together paving the way for healing and redemption."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on jonah tolchin 's:    - instrument     - genre       - name     - background     - label     - birth place     - occupation     Bio: jonah tolchin is an american singer-songwriter , musician , and new jersey native . he performed at the newport folk festival in 2012 . tolchin released his first full-length album , \`\` criminal man '' , independently in 2012 . he is currently signed to yep roc records .

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y.

Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet.  - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\")  are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890  1937).  - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen.   - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.  - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\").  - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes.  - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

First sentence: \\"Former AFL players Tarkyn Lockyer (Collingwood) and Ryan Brabazon (Sydney), Jason Mandzij (Gold Coast) started their football careers playing for the Kangas.\\" This sentence emphasizes that the players (Tarkyn Lockyer, Ryan Brabazon, and Jason Mandzij) are former AFL players, and it states the teams they were associated with at that level (Collingwood, Sydney, and Gold Coast, respectively). It also informs us that they began their football careers playing for the Kangas, implying that playing for the Kangas was their stepping stone before advancing to the AFL. 2. Second sentence: \\"The former AFL players Tarkyn Lockyer (Collingwood) and Ryan Brabazon (Sydney), Jason Mandzij (Gold Coast), started their football careers and played for the Kangas.\\" In this sentence, mentioning that they are former AFL players also carries the same emphasis as in the first sentence. However, the wording and structure imply that they started their football careers in general and also played for the Kangas during that time. While still highlighting their time with the Kangas, it leaves a bit of ambiguity regarding whether playing for the Kangas was their first step in their football careers or only one of the teams they played for at the beginning. In conclusion, both sentences aim to convey that Tarkyn Lockyer, Ryan Brabazon, and Jason Mandzij are former AFL players who played for the Kangas at some point in their careers. However, the first sentence implies that playing for the Kangas marked the beginning of their careers, while the second sentence suggests that their time playing for the Kangas was part of their early careers, though not necessarily the starting point."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But not even these difficulties can stop Europeans' love for cycling. According to Reuters, more bicycles have been sold than cars in 26 of the European Union's 28 states this year. In some European countries, people really love bicycles. \\"People ride to work and take their bikes to the grocery store\\", Bill Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine, told the reporter from Reuters. So what has led to cycling's growing popularity in Europe? Cycling is \\"a safe, clean, healthy, inexpensive way to get around town,\\" the Daily Star concluded. \\"It not only reduces traffic problems and pollution, but also contributes to public health.\\" Bike-friendly rules have also been made. Dozens of cities have joined a European Union initiative to make bicycles a form of city transport, like cars. Quite a few cities such as Stockholm, London, Florence and Munich now offer special bike lanes. Copenhagen takes it a step further by keeping bicycles and cars separated as much as possible. On these _ , traffic lights are designed to the rhythms of bicycles, not cars. For people living far from city centers, getting to work by bicycle alone may take too much time. That's why many European countries now allow cyclists to bring their bicycles onto subway trains. Europeans are also creative in solving parking problems. Amsterdam has come up with a high-tech solution: you lock your bike to a rack , which then goes underground. When you want your bike back, it is brought back to the surface.

Q: who controlled the house and senate in 1994? A:","output":"In 1994, both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the United States were controlled by the Republican Party. This was a landmark year in American politics, as the midterm elections held on November 8, 1994, resulted in significant power shifts, collectively referred to as the \\"Republican Revolution.\\" Prior to the 1994 midterm elections, the Democratic Party had been in control of both the House and the Senate. The House had been under Democratic control for 40 consecutive years since 1954, while the Senate had been under Democratic control for most of the time since the 1950s, with a brief period of Republican control during the early 1980s before the Democrats reclaimed the majority. The 1994 elections saw the Republican Party gain a net of 54 seats in the House of Representatives, securing 230 seats in total, compared to the Democratic Party's 204 seats. This allowed Newt Gingrich, a leading Republican and the architect of the ambitious \\"Contract with America\\" policy platform, to become the Speaker of the House. In the Senate, Republicans gained a net of 8 seats, resulting in a total of 52 Republican seats compared to the Democrats' 48 seats. This change in numerical strength allowed Republican Bob Dole to become the Senate Majority Leader after the elections. The Republican Revolution in 1994 can be attributed to various factors, including the growing dissatisfaction with the policies of then-Democratic President Bill Clinton, the impact of the \\"Contract with America\\" policy platform that promised major reforms, and prevalent anti-incumbency sentiments within the electorate. Thus, in 1994, the Republican Party successfully took control of both the House of Representatives and Senate, significantly altering the balance of power in American politics and setting the stage for an era of divided government that has continued with varying dynamics to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sweet smell of freshly baked blueberry muffins filled the air, effortlessly creating a warm and inviting atmosphere in the cozy kitchen. Michael had arranged the ingredients and kitchen tools meticulously on the kitchen counter, showcasing his passion for baking and his craving for an organized workspace. As Michael checked on the muffins, a quiet 'ding' was heard as the oven timer announced that they had reached the perfect doneness. He opened the oven carefully, revealing two perfectly golden trays of the tastiest, fluffiest blueberry muffins one could ever imagine. With a proud smile, he pulled them out of the oven, placing the trays on the cooling rack for a few minutes. The aroma in the room intensified as the warm muffins released tiny plumes of steam, causing Ian's mouth to water in anticipation. Ian perched on a barstool near the kitchen island, enthusiastically waiting for the muffins to cool down. The two friends chatted idly about their day, their chatter accompanied by the soft sizzle of the cooling muffins, exuding a positive and uplifting energy that only good conversation and good food could create. The time had come to sample the fruits of Michael's labor. He elegantly plated two glossy, buttery muffins on small, porcelain plates for himself and Ian. Impatiently, they took their first bites, savoring the tender texture, the crunch of the slightly caramelized muffin tops, and the burst of natural sweetness from the plump blueberries. Their taste buds danced with joy upon finding the perfect balance between sweet and tangy, a testament to Michael's baking expertise. It was evident that the muffins were more than a delicious snack - they represented the bond between these two friends. The warmth, love, and dedication shared through baking proved that it was not just about the final product but about the process and memories created. As they continued to share stories and laughs between bites of the phenomenal muffins, it was truly a moment of connection and happiness that would stay with them long after the plates were empty and the muffins were gone. Time ticked by, and Ian could not keep quiet about how good the muffins were. He insisted Michael share his recipe with him so that he, too, could spread the love of blueberry muffins with friends and family. With a modest grin, Michael obliged and walked Ian through the meticulous details, resulting in the passing of not just a recipe but of an experience, a symbol of friendship and connection that would ultimately contribute to similar memories being built with more people in times to come. And so, through the simple act of baking and sharing muffins, a bond had been nourished, a connection solidified, and a memory etched into their hearts, to be cherished and revisited on countless occasions.

A carriage with 6 people is going into the town near Count Dracula's castle. The driver drops everyone off and then talks to a townie about where Renfield (Dwight Frye), one of the passengers is going next. The townie pleads with him not to go, for that is the castle of Count Dracula and his Vampire wives.Despite the warnings, Renfield decides to go anyways. As he arrives, female Vampires are rising from their tombs in the castle as the evil Dracula watches. Then Renfield enters, though he is leery to. Of course after seeing some creepy creatures scurrying around the castle, he is greeted by the infamous Count, who bids him\\"welcome\\". Later, Renfield confirms that he kept his visit to Dracula's castle a secret, and then they discuss the sale of the castle which is what Renfield came for.They say good night and Renfield prepares to turn in. Three female vampires enter his room as he passes out from an encounter from the vampire bat (Dracula). In the next scene, Renfeild is shown as Dracula's ghoul that wakes him after sunset. Dracula is then shown on the very stormy ocean in a ship, on their way to London. After Dracula and his ghoul are on land, a newspaper describing the fate of the entire crew is displayed. It also stated the the only survivor was the now insane Renfeild who is under Dr's. supervision. Dracula waits until dark and then goes to the Opera and immediately introduces himself to Dr. Seward,His wife, their daughter Mina, and her escort John Harker. As they chat, Dracula tries to intrigue Mina, his next targeted victim. Later that night, the Vampire visits her while she is in bed. The next day, Renfeild is shown at the assylum screaming and raving. Then Vanhelsing is shown doing blood work on one of Dracula's dead victims. He tells Dr. Seward who is treating Renfield, and a few other men, that they are dealing with the undead.

Here is a question about this article: The junction forward voltage is the voltage applied to the emitter–base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \\"drive\\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes. What is the answer to this question: When happens to the junction forward voltage when temperature is raised?","output":"When the temperature is raised, the junction forward voltage of a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) tends to decrease. This temperature dependency is an inherent characteristic of semiconductor materials, and it affects the behavior of the transistor under varying temperature conditions. For a typical silicon junction, the change in the junction forward voltage with respect to temperature can be approximated as -2.1 mV/°C. This means that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, the junction forward voltage decreases by approximately 2.1 millivolts. Conversely, for every degree Celsius decrease in temperature, the junction forward voltage increases by approximately the same amount. This temperature dependency of the junction forward voltage is important because it affects the current flowing through the transistor and consequently, the overall performance of the electronic circuit. As the junction forward voltage decreases with increasing temperature, the current through the transistor increases exponentially, making the transistor more sensitive to the input signal and potentially leading to undesirable effects such as increased power consumption and overheating. To overcome these challenges posed by the temperature-sensitive behavior of the junction forward voltage, some circuits employ special compensating elements called \\"sensistors.\\" These components are designed to compensate for the temperature-induced changes in the junction forward voltage, thereby stabilizing the transistor's performance and maintaining the desired functionality of the electronic circuit over a wide range of temperature variations. By compensating for the changes in junction forward voltage, sensistors help to ensure that the transistor and the overall circuit operate consistently and predictably even as the temperature fluctuates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Extreme weight loss: New personal stomach pump sucks food straight out of stomach From diet pills to hormonal injections to expensive stomach surgery, people are continuously looking for quick fixes when it comes to losing weight. And for some, weight loss is much more difficult than just cutting calories. Now, the company Aspire Bariatrics says they have a breakthrough solution for people struggling with obesity: a personal stomach pump. Developed by a group of inventors led by Dean Kamen – most well-known for inventing the Segway – the device is meant to suck out partially digested food straight out of the stomach. The system, called the AspireAssist, has been developed into a commercial product but has not yet been FDA approved; however, Aspire Bariatrics has applied for a patent. According to the company’s website, a silicone, rubber tube called the A-Tube is surgically implanted in the stomach, which is connected to the “Skin-Port” on the outside of the abdomen. The Skin-Port acts as a valve, allowing the patient to open and close the flow of food from their stomach. Approximately 20 minutes after meal is finished, the patient will perform the “aspiration” process, in which they use the AspireAssist to remove 30 percent of their stomach’s contents before the calories are absorbed. Once aspiration is over, the patient is supposed to squeeze a pouch of water back into their stomach to help loosen food particles remaining in the stomach. While the device is meant to aid public health, there have already been setbacks with the product. According to the Independent, the pump has a hard time breaking up large foods. People using it are advised to avoid cauliflower, broccoli, Chinese food, chips, pretzels and more – to prevent clogging of the device. Click for more from Aspire Bariatrics.

Plot title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family.

Today, we're going to learn about how to calculate fuel costs for your family's car. This is a fun way to help your parents, and it helps everyone learn how much it costs to drive. Don't worry; we'll use simple words and examples to make it easy for you to understand. So, let's get started! 1. What is fuel? Fuel is the stuff that cars need to keep them moving, just like how people need food for energy! Cars usually use gasoline or diesel as their fuel. 2. How do we measure fuel? We measure fuel in gallons or liters, depending on where you live. In some countries, like the United States, people use gallons to measure fuel. In other countries, like Canada, people use liters. 3. Step-by-step guide to calculating fuel costs: Now, let's learn how to calculate the cost of the fuel that a car uses. We'll do it in four easy steps: Step 1: Write down the number on the odometer. The odometer is a little screen in the car that shows how many miles or kilometers the car has moved. When the fuel tank is almost empty, check the odometer and write down the number. Step 2: Fill the tank when it's nearly empty. When the fuel tank is almost empty, have a grown-up fill it up at a gas station. Remember to write down how many gallons or liters the car needs to fill up the tank. Step 3: Check the odometer again and find the difference. When the fuel tank is nearly empty again, check the odometer one more time and write down the new number. Subtract the first number you wrote down from the second number. This tells you how far the car went using the fuel from the last fill-up. Step 4: Calculate fuel costs. Divide the distance the car drove (from Step 3) by the number of gallons or liters of fuel it took to fill the tank (from Step 2). This gives you the number of miles or kilometers your car moves per gallon or liter of fuel.  Now, let's figure out how much it costs to drive the car for a month. Divide the total distance the car moves in a month (ask your parents for help) by the miles or kilometers per gallon or liter you found in the previous step. This tells you how many gallons or liters of fuel you need for a month. Finally, multiply that number of gallons or liters by the cost of a gallon or liter of gasoline. The result is your monthly fuel cost! And there you have it! Now you know a simple way to calculate the fuel costs for your family's car.

How do I get rid of ingrown hair? How do I get rid of an ingrown hair in my eyebrow? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Imagine that your hair is like a little tunnel, and the hair is a tiny car driving out of the tunnel. An ingrown hair is when the car gets lost and starts to drive in circles under the skin, causing a bump.  To get rid of an ingrown hair, you must help the car find its way back out of the tunnel. You can do this by: 1. Clean the area with soap and water and make sure your hands and tools are clean too. 2. Apply a warm washcloth to the area, like a soft cloud hugging your skin, to soften it and make it easier for the car to find its way out. 3. If you see the car (the hair) looped under your skin, you can use sterilized tweezers to gently lift it out of the loop but don't pull it all the way out, just guide it to the right path. Ingrown hair in your eyebrow is just like an ingrown hair anywhere else on your body, but it's in the area where your eyebrows sit, like having a lost car in a different town. You can use the same 3 steps to help the lost car in your eyebrow area find its way out. Yes, these two questions are similar.

Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi The grass glows like lime juice, the moss-dark trees enfold a village whose white walls and red rooftops shine in that moment after the rain. Through satin-grey air arcs a rainbow. But the eyes of the blind beggar don't see any of this. Victorian sentimentality has no purer expression than John Everett Millais' painting The Blind Girl. There is something amazingly crass about it. Few other paintings dare to say, in such a frank way: wouldn't it be terrible to be blind? Millais deploys all his lurid chromatic resources to make you meditate on that. In so doing, you find yourself shocked into sharing the wonder of the blind girl's young sister, turning to stare at the rainbow. Through what might seem trite rhetoric, Millais achieves a profundity comparable with Rembrandt's images of blindness. He makes you see your own seeing - and makes you think about perception itself. The Blind Girl is a mawkish, manipulative masterpiece. Seeing it, and others, in Tate Britain's revelatory exhibition of Millais gave me a shock: I've discovered that I like the pre-Raphaelites. Learning to despise the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood is almost a rite of passage for art critics. Founded in 1848 in Millais' studio in London, this self-consciously alternative art movement rejected what it saw as the false sophistication introduced into art in the 16th century by Raphael; the pre-Raphaelites wanted to return to the honesty of medieval art. Just to describe their ideas is to see their problem. They were dusty students of past art, just as \\"academic\\" as the Royal Academicians whose slavish devotion to the classics they attacked. Meanwhile, over in Paris, modern art was making them look like, well, Victorians. Millais' manifesto painting for me is Isabella, which drips hatred not just of all that stuff about Raphael but of something more tangible: Victorian capitalism. It's a hilariously pleasurable picture, an over-the-top \\"history painting\\" that takes the conventions of narrative art and pumps them up, with sumptuous silks, passionate looks and a lurid threat of sex and violence. It illustrates a poem by Keats, itself inspired by a tale in Boccaccio's Decameron, about a woman in medieval Florence whose brothers murdered her lover because he stood in the way of a prosperous marriage. Keats gives the story a political twist by making it clear that the brothers are just like grasping 19th-century industrialists. The row of diners Millais painted in Isabella is a study of smug, self-satisfied mercantile faces - as sharp a portrait of Victorian values as anything in Dickens. The year the brotherhood was founded, 1848, was a year of revolution across Europe, the year that spawned the Communist Manifesto. Millais' sympathy for outsiders dominates his early paintings. Their bright colours and deliberate physical gawkiness cannot disguise his identification with a succession of the socially and politically excluded: Jacobite rebels, exiled Huguenots, heretics, vagrants - and, of course, those famous pre-Raphaelite women. But what strikes you about Millais' women is not so much the long hair and dreamy looks, but the unease, solitude and longing: they are caught between a miserable reality and a utopian dream. This can be glimpsed in The Bridesmaid, a painting that transports you into its subject's psychological state. She is obviously full of hope - but what for? Millais' most famous portrait of a victim is Ophelia, destroyed by the courtly intrigues of Elsinore, dragged down by her billowing dress into water whose mossy texture invites the mind to brood on green morbidities. The painting made Millais a hero, but it is also the key to his modernity: it looks forward to the dark introspection of Arnold Böcklin and Edvard Munch at the end of the 19th century. The pre-Raphaelites were out of date in their own time. Millais' patient, photographic landscapes totally lack the freedom of the impressionists, but his appetite for ideas and symbols, for poetry and introspection, perversely inspired fin-de-siècle symbolism. Millais is a thoroughbred Victorian. His youthful, radical style soon made him rich, a pillar of the establishment, a friend of Prime Minister Gladstone. He portrayed Gladstone and his rival Disraeli; these are his best formal portraits, and enduring icons of parliament. He even showed artists a new way of making money with his soppy painting Bubbles, used as a soap advert. That doesn't make him a precocious predecessor of Andy Warhol, nor do his late landscapes hold even the tiniest candle to Monet. It's this kind of ridiculous claim that makes critics suspect the pre-Raphaelites were rubbish. \\"One of the highest and noblest expressions of art will always be that of the English, for instance Millais,\\" wrote Van Gogh. This exhibition - for all the torpor that piles up in later rooms, like the furnishings of a Victorian vicarage - makes you see what so moved Van Gogh about Millais. Visually, he is at worst leaden, at best brazen - but he's got something. He's got an idea. Indeed, the Victorians excelled far more at ideas about art than they did at art. Millais had a special relationship with the greatest of all Victorian thinkers about art: his portrait of the critic John Ruskin is here. He is standing on rocks, about whose geology the critic lectured the artist - who was at that moment forming a passionate relationship with Ruskin's soon-to-be-ex-wife Effie. The divorce was on the grounds of Ruskin's impotence. There I go, doing what people do, laughing at eminent Victorians. But the man standing on these rocks is a genius. Ruskin will always be read by those who care about art and the English language. Millais was admired by Ruskin as well as by Van Gogh. Those two fans should give us pause. Both are heroes of intensity and craggy passion, of art and belief. At its best, the art of Millais and his pre-Raphaelite brethren speaks - with force and courage - of deep emotional truths. However much we want to forget it, like a Victorian ghost in the attic, it courses secretly through the modern imagination, a dark undertow sagged with silk and herbs. Millais is at Tate Britain, London, from Wednesday to January 13. Details: 020-7887 8888.

Editor's note: Randall Balmer, an Episcopal priest, is professor of American religious history at Barnard College, Columbia University, and a visiting professor at Emory University. His most recent book is \\"God in the White House: How Faith Shaped the Presidency from John F. Kennedy to George W. Bush.\\" Randall Balmer supports Obama's unusual broadening of a president's words to include nonbelievers. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama's mention of \\"nonbelievers\\" in his inaugural address represents an important broadening of the circle of acceptability in American life, an acknowledgement of our growing diversity and a fuller embrace of the principles articulated in our nation's charter documents. The story of religion in","output":"America is a fascinating and complex narrative, one that has alternately nurtured and tested the boundaries of unity and diversity throughout the nation's history. As the American religious landscape has evolved, with countless denominations and faith traditions coexisting and intermingling, so too has the public discourse surrounding belief and nonbelief. In recent times, nonbelievers – whether self-identified as atheists, agnostics, or simply as those without religious affiliation – have grown increasingly prominent and vocal, challenging traditional assumptions about the role of religion in public life. Obama's acknowledgement of nonbelievers in his inaugural address signifies a crucial moment of inclusion for this segment of the American population, as well as a testament to the nation's stated commitment to tolerance and religious freedom. This recognition is both timely and necessary, as the number of nonbelievers in America has been on the rise over the past several decades. According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Americans identifying as religiously unaffiliated has increased from around 16% in 2007 to nearly 23% in 2014. Furthermore, this group is projected to continue growing in the years to come. Obama's inclusion of nonbelievers also resonates with the core beliefs enshrined in the United States Constitution, particularly the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of religion – or the freedom to not adhere to one. This principle emphasizes the separation of church and state and ensures that the government remains secular, meaning that it neither promotes nor discriminates against any particular religious or non-religious group. Inclusion of nonbelievers in the presidential discourse sends a powerful message that America is a nation united not only by shared values and aspirations but also by our ability to appreciate and respect the differences among us. This gesture embodies the true spirit of democracy, which thrives on dialogue, diversity, and the understanding that every citizen has a unique contribution to make to the larger story of the United States.  In conclusion, President Obama's mention of \\"nonbelievers\\" in his inaugural address marks a significant and timely shift in the conversation about the role of religion in the United States. By acknowledging the growing population of nonbelievers and reaffirming the nation's commitment to religious freedom, Obama highlights the importance of embracing our growing diversity and further fosters an environment of tolerance and respect for all Americans, regardless of their religious convictions or lack thereof."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I will break it down and provide an explanation for each component. 1. Structure: The sentence follows the correct rules of English grammar in terms of sentence structure. It follows a simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order with \\"there\\" as the subject, \\"raged\\" as the verb, and \\"a fire\\" as the object. The prepositional phrase \\"in the mountains\\" serves as an adverbial modifier telling where the fire raged. 2. Vocabulary: The words used in the sentence are appropriate, though slightly informal. \\"Raged\\" is an informal verb that describes a strong, uncontrollable event or action (in this case, a fire). Its usage is not incorrect, but it conveys a particular tone or style that may be atypical in formal writing.  3. Conjunctions and prepositions: There is no conjunction in the sentence, but there is a preposition, \\"in,\\" which is used correctly to show the location where the fire raged (the mountains). 4. Punctuation: The sentence does not contain any punctuation marks that would affect its grammaticality. It has a period indicating the end of the sentence, which is the correct punctuation for a statement. 5. Capitalization: The first word of the sentence, \\"In,\\" is capitalized, which follows the standard rule for capitalizing the first word in a sentence. In conclusion, while the sentence may have an informal tone because of the choice of words like \\"raged\\" and \\"there\\", and may sound a bit unusual, it is a grammatically correct English sentence.

Markets Mixed as Focus Shifts to Earnings Wall Street edged higher on Thursday as investors weighed the impact of an agreement by lawmakers in Washington to reopen the federal government and raise the United States debt ceiling, but disappointing earnings from I.B.M. weighed on the Dow. In afternoon trading the Standard & Poorâs 500-share index was up 0.3 percent and Nasdaq composite gained 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average was 0.4 percent lower. âToday we are in a sigh of relief that we have averted the crisis, but longer term we havenât solved the problem,â said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Scottsdale, Ariz. âEarnings are going to reflect the damage that was done, and if not the earnings, definitely the forward guidance.â The Dow was dragged lower by I.B.M.'s shares hitting a two-year low a day after reporting a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenue, weaker than expected. I.B.M., a tech bellwether, was also the worst performing stock on the S. & P., trading down 6.8 percent. Earlier Thursday, President Obama signed into law a last-minute agreement in Congress to end a partial government shutdown and pull the country back from the brink of a debt default that would have had damaging ripple effects across the world. The deal provides merely a temporary fix, however, as it finances the federal government until only Jan. 15 and raises the debt ceiling until Feb. 7, with the prospect of another bitter budget fight and shutdown early next year. âMarkets are back to business, the U.S. shutdown was just noise at the end,â said Vincent Ganne, analyst at FXCM. âThe spotlight is now on company news as well as on the Fedâs next policy meeting and the outlook for its quantitative easing program.â Around Europe, the Britainâs FTSE 100 index ended the session up 0.1 percent, Germanyâs DAX index lost 0.4 percent, and Franceâs CAC 40 down 0.1 percent. Asian indexes closed mixed earlier. On the earnings front, Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.7 percent after it said its quarterly profit dropped amid weak bond-trading volumes. But Verizon Communications shares rose 3.6 percent after the company posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. EBay dropped 3.9 percent after the company gave a disappointing holiday forecast on Wednesday, saying the United States economic environment had deteriorated partly because of the government shutdown. Also, shares in food giant NestlÃ© rose 3.1 percent after the company said an improvement in emerging market demand helped increase sales growth in the third quarter, reassuring investors worried by recent negative news from European rivals Danone and Unilever. Carrefour, the worldâs No. 2 retailer, rose 3.1 percent after the group said sales at its French hypermarkets returned to growth in the third quarter while China sales also improved. Interest rates on ultra-short-term United States government debt, which had ballooned in recent days as fears of a default grew, fell sharply Thursday in wake of the deal in Washington. The rates on the October and November issues fell as much as 20 basis points to their lowest since the end of September.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

If \\"Small white dog with spot on back leaping in air with football in mouth with small boy and man watching.\\", does this mean that \\"The dog is happy.\\"?","output":"Based on the given description, \\"Small white dog with spot on back leaping in air with football in mouth with small boy and man watching\\", it can be inferred that the dog might be happy. Here's a more detailed analysis: 1. Leaping in the air: Dogs often express their excitement and happiness through physical actions. Jumping or leaping in the air is one such action that can indicate a dog's joyful state. The small white dog leaping in the air, in this case, suggests the possibility of happiness and enthusiasm. 2. Football in mouth: Dogs are known to have an instinctual drive to fetch or carry objects in their mouths. Engaging in play activities, like carrying a football in their mouth, can be an indicator of a dog's happiness and contentment. As the dog in question is holding the football in its mouth, this can be another sign of the dog's happiness. 3. Attention from small boy and man: Dogs are social animals who find happiness and contentment in the presence of their human companions. Having the attention of a small boy and a man watching the dog can be seen as a source of happiness and joy for the dog. Social interaction and positive experiences, such as this one, often contribute to a dog's emotional well-being. 4. Inherent qualities of small white dogs: While dog personalities can vary widely based on factors such as breed, size, and individual temperament, many small white dogs are known for their playful and energetic nature. Assuming the provided description refers to a typical small white dog, one may further infer that the dog is likely to feel happy and joyful during playtime. However, it is important to note that while these elements suggest the potential for the dog's happiness, we cannot be entirely certain of the dog's emotional state without further context or direct observation of the dog's behavior and body language. Dogs display a wide range of emotions, and their expressions can be easily misinterpreted. It would be prudent to look for additional indicators of happiness, such as tail wagging or a relaxed demeanor, to confidently conclude that the dog is indeed happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A butterfly lays an egg - A larvae matures inside of the egg - The caterpillar hatches from the egg - The caterpillar eats and grows - The caterpillar spins a coccoon around itself and forms into a pupa - The butterfly forms inside of the coccoon - The mature butterfly emerges from the coccoon - The butterfly mates - The female butterfly lays eggs.  Question: suppose less larvae matures happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less A decrease in the number of larvae maturing inside the eggs will lead to fewer butterflies. Let us break down the process to better understand this relationship.  The life cycle of a butterfly involves four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult (butterfly). This process is as follows: 1. A butterfly lays an egg: The life cycle starts with an adult butterfly laying eggs on a host plant, providing a source of food for the caterpillar.   2. A larva matures inside of the egg: The larva, or caterpillar, develops inside the egg. This process is critical, as the larva must mature properly to progress to the next stage of the butterfly's life cycle. 3. The caterpillar hatches from the egg: Once the larva is fully developed, it hatches from the egg and emerges as a caterpillar. 4. The caterpillar eats and grows: The caterpillar feeds on the host plant and continues to grow, eventually outgrowing its exoskeleton during a process called molting. 5. The caterpillar spins a cocoon around itself and forms into a pupa: When the caterpillar is fully grown, it attaches itself to a stable surface and forms a protective cocoon ─ known as a chrysalis ─ around its body. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a metamorphosis, transforming into a pupa. 6. The butterfly forms inside of the cocoon: The pupa continues to develop within the chrysalis, eventually transitioning into the adult butterfly stage. 7. The mature butterfly emerges from the cocoon: Once the transformation is complete, the adult butterfly breaks free from the chrysalis and emerges. 8. The butterfly mates: Adult butterflies locate a mate and reproduce, restarting the cycle when the female butterfly lays eggs. Considering these steps, if fewer larvae mature inside the eggs, fewer caterpillars will hatch and become available to progress through the life cycle. This will directly result in a decreased number of caterpillars transitioning to the pupa stage and, subsequently, fewer adult butterflies emerging from the chrysalis. In conclusion, if less larvae maturity occurs, option B is correct, as there will be fewer butterflies successfully completing their life cycle and reproducing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: The European-built Cupola was added to the International Space Station in 2010 and continues to provide the best room with a view anywhere.      In addition to serving as an observation and work area when the crew operates the Station’s robotic arms, it also provides excellent views of Earth, celestial objects and visiting vehicles.      Its fused-silica and borosilicate-glass windows, however, sometime suffer from impacts by tiny artificial objects: space debris.      ESA astronaut Tim Peake took this photo from inside Cupola last month, showing a 7 mm-diameter circular chip gouged out by the impact from a tiny piece of space debris, possibly a paint flake or small metal fragment no bigger than a few thousandths of a millimetre across. The background just shows the inky blackness of space.      “I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris. Yes – this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!” says Tim.      To cater for such possibilities, the Station is provided with extensive shielding around all vital crew and technical areas, so that minor strikes, like this one, pose no threat.      While a chip like the one shown here may be minor, larger debris would pose a serious threat. An object up to 1 cm in size could disable an instrument or a critical flight system on a satellite. Anything above 1 cm could penetrate the shields of the Station’s crew modules, and anything larger than 10 cm could shatter a satellite or spacecraft into pieces.      “ESA is at the forefront of developing and implementing debris-mitigation guidelines, because the best way to avoid problems from orbital debris is not to cause them in the first place,” says Holger Krag, Head of ESA’s Space Debris Office.      “These guidelines are applied to all new missions flown by ESA, and include dumping fuel tanks and discharging batteries at the end of a mission, to avoid explosions, and ensuring that satellites reenter the atmosphere and safely burn up within 25 years of the end of their working lives.”      More information      Space Debris      Clean Space      SSA - Space Situational Awareness      Challenge of Space Debris - April 2016 (Brochure, PDF) ||||| On Friday a number of movers and shakers in the space sector met at London’s Royal Astronomical Society to support the launch of ‘Adrift,’ an interactive art project that aims to raise awareness about the dangers of space debris.      In the 60 years since the launch of Sputnik I—the first artificial object placed into orbit—space agencies have managed to create hundreds of millions of pieces of orbital debris. The vast majority of this debris (nearly 200 million pieces) are smaller than one centimeter, about 670,000 pieces are between 1 and 10 centimeters, and approximately 29,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimeters in orbit.      While millions of specks of space trash might not sound so bad, when they’re moving at thousands of miles per hour in orbit they can do serious damage. ESA astronaut Tim Peake reminded the world of this threat earlier this year when he took a picture of a 7mm crack in the International Space Station’s cupola window that was likely caused by a rogue chip of paint only a few thousandths of a millimeter across.      Chip in the ISS cupola made by a speck of paint. Image: ESA      While it is impossible to track the millions of pieces of micro-debris in orbit, NASA and other space agencies are keeping tabs on most of the 29,000 larger pieces of debris, which pose a serious threat to the safety of crewed missions. These pieces of debris are the subject of ‘Adrift,’ a collaborative art project led by Cath Le Couteur and Nick Ryan who have created a machine that tracks 27,000 pieces of space junk in real time and turns them into music as they pass overhead.      The art project also allows anybody to ‘adopt’ one of three different pieces of space junk, which will tweet at you every time the object passes overhead. The first piece of space debris up for adoption is the Vanguard I, the first solar powered satellite. Vanguard I was launched by the United States in 1958 making it the oldest object still in orbit.      Then there’s the SuitSat, a Russian spacesuit that is full of trash was pushed out of the ISS in 2006 with a radio unit attached to it. The suit was nicknamed Ivan Ivanovich—the Russian equivalent of John Doe—which was also the name given to the mannequin used to test the Vostok spacecraft in the lead up to the Soviet Union’s first crewed missions. The SuitSat-1 fell out of orbit within a few weeks of its deployment, so it is unclear which piece of debris the SuitSat’s Twitter account is tracking.                        The final piece of space junk up for adoption is a piece from Fengyun-1C, a Chinese weather satellite that was intentionally destroyed by China with an anti-satellite missile in 2007. This particular event nearly doubled the amount of space debris in orbit in one fell swoop and raised concerns about the calamitous results of kinetic warfare in space.      The music machine and debris adoption program are all in service of ‘Adrift,’ a mini-documentary focusing on the threat of space junk and the ongoing attempts to get it under control. Barring space warfare, some scientists are wringing their hands at the idea of Kessler Syndrome, an uncontrollable chain of collisions that would exponentially increase the amount of space debris in orbit once the amount of space junk in orbit reaches a certain threshold. Which is to say that if you want a vision of the future, imagine space junk ramming into space junk…forever.      Although the International Telecommunications Union now requires that anyone who deploys a satellite must be able to deorbit the satellite within 25 years, space scientists are still grappling with how to remove the space junk that is already in orbit to stave off catastrophe. This has led to some pretty wild ideas for capturing and disposing of space junk, including blasting it with lasers and huge nets.      Check out the mini-documentary here: ||||| A display shows approaching space debris as part of a digital art project around space debris created by British composer and sound artist Nick Ryan entitled 'Adrift' at the Royal Astronomical Society in London on November 18, 2016 The mass of \\"space junk\\" orbiting the Earth poses a serious threat to future exploration, a British scientist said on Friday at the launch of a project to raise awareness of the issue.      \\"Tackling the problem of space debris is one of humankind's greatest environmental challenges, but is also perhaps the one that is the least known,\\" said Hugh Lewis, head of astronautics research at the University of Southampton.      He was supporting the launch of a creative project at London's Royal Astronomical Society by artists and scientists aiming to shed light on the 27,000 pieces of debris being tracked as they orbit the Earth.      There are believed to be around 100 million pieces in total, but some are too small to chart.      So-called \\"space junk\\" has been left in space during the many missions that have taken place since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, in 1957.      The debris now poses a serious threat to future space exploration, scientists warn.      \\"Every day, we use and rely on services provided by satellites without ever realising how vulnerable they are,\\" said Lewis.      Space debris puts these satellites at risk of being destroyed or damaged and \\"may affect the dreams and ambitions of future generations to work and live in space\\", he said.      The project, titled \\"Adrift\\", uses film, sound and social media to explore the dangers of space junk.      A documentary by filmmaker Cath Le Couteur features British-American meteorologist and astronaut Piers Sellers, who dropped his spatula during a space walk on NASA's \\"Discovery\\" mission in 2006.      The tool was left travelling at a speed of 27,000 kilometres per hour before burning up in the atmosphere.      \\"Space debris as an operating astronaut, it was just the enemy... It's a sleet of very fast-moving stuff,\\" Sellers said in the film.      Speaking at the launch, Le Couteur said the documentary highlighted a \\"critical contemporary crisis\\".      \\"It is now a very serious threat to future space exploration, to us here on Earth, and to the damage and destruction of satellites that we rely on,\\" she said.      Audiences can \\"adopt\\" a piece of space junk on Twitter, such as Vanguard, the second US satellite into space and the oldest existing piece of space debris.      The project also includes an attempt to follow audibly the path of space debris, using an electromechanical sound instrument to transform its movement into sound.      BAFTA-winning composer and sound artist Nick Ryan recorded 1,000 sounds using objects chosen to represent space debris—which itself is silent—and used it to represent live data from space.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post.  On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May.  The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.  In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange.

Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. Rockefeller traveled widely and met with both foreign rulers and U.S. presidents, beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower. At times he served as an unofficial emissary on high-level business.

Rockefeller supported his \\"opening of China\\" initiative in 1971 as it afforded banking opportunities for the Chase Bank.  Though a lifelong Republican and party contributor, he was a member of the moderate \\"Rockefeller Republicans\\" that arose out of the political ambitions and public policy stance of his brother Nelson. In 2006 he teamed up with former Goldman Sachs executives and others to form a fund-raising group based in Washington, Republicans Who Care, that supported moderate Republican candidates over more ideological contenders.","output":"This text is about David Rockefeller.

Step 2: Analyzing wording Both sentences share the following phrases: \\"reports state,\\" \\"the Syrian government,\\" \\"concealing a nuclear facility,\\" and \\"at the attacked site.\\" This shared wording suggests a high degree of similarity. Step 3: Analyzing context The context of the two sentences is the same - both discuss reports about the Syrian government concealing a nuclear facility. However, the second sentence adds more information, mentioning the role of u.n. experts. This additional detail slightly affects the similarity.

In Sentence 1, we learn about a road along the dunes and pine groves lining the Gulf of Asinara, making an enjoyable excursion.

Golf is a game where you have to hit a small ball into a hole using a special stick called a club. In this big tournament, Adam Scott started very well. He played one round of golf, which means he went through the whole course hitting his ball. Remember, in golf, the less you hit the ball, the better you are! And our hero Adam hit the ball only 62 times in his first round, tying the course record! A course record is the best score ever at that place. Isn't it amazing? Adam managed to make seven birdies, two eagles, and one bogey. Birdies are when you finish the hole using one less shot than what is expected. Eagles are even better - you need two less shots! A bogey is when you need one more shot than expected.  But do you know what is really surprising? He did all that while feeling sick!

Yes The answer is:","output":"(I). No A \\"full job time\\" typically refers to a full-time job, which means that an employee works a minimum number of hours per week as defined by their employer and/or relevant labor laws. In many countries, including the United States, a full-time job typically consists of a 35 to 40 hour work week, distributed over five days. The statement \\"Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime\\" does not accurately describe a full-time job, as it only gives an example of a specific work schedule that may or may not be considered full-time depending on the total number of hours worked and the company's policies or labor laws in the respective country. Some jobs do have alternative full-time schedules, such as working longer shifts over fewer days. These are often referred to as \\"compressed workweeks\\" or \\"alternative work schedules.\\" Though a 12-hour shift, three days per week, does not necessarily meet the traditional definition of full-time, it could be considered full-time if the total of 36 hours per week's work met the minimum hour requirements established by the employer or labor laws. Moreover, overtime payment regulations depend on various factors, such as the number of hours worked, the type of employment, and the jurisdiction. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act governs overtime rules, and usually, an employee who works beyond the established 40-hour workweek is entitled to overtime pay, which is generally one-and-a-half times their regular rate. However, some salaried employees in specific positions or pay ranges may be exempt from such rules. In conclusion, although the statement you provided could relate to a specific type of full-time job, it does not offer a comprehensive explanation of what a full time job is since it focuses on an alternative work schedule example rather than describing the general concept of full-time employment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To make an informed decision on which solution would be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, let us analyze both solutions first. Solution 1: Iron-on patches In this solution, grip-enhancing iron-on patches can be attached to the soles of toddler socks. These patches can be made from materials such as rubber or silicone, which are designed to have a high coefficient of friction, making them grippy when applied to the bottom of socks. Consider the following advantages and disadvantages: Advantages: 1. Easy application: Iron-on patches are relatively easy to apply, requiring only an iron to heat the adhesive and attach it securely to the sock material. 2. Customizability: This solution allows for the application of patches in different shapes, designs, and sizes, depending on the sock and the child's needs. 3. Effectiveness: The patches can significantly improve sock grip, making it harder for the child to slip. Disadvantages: 1. Durability: Over time, iron-on patches may wear out or fall off due to repeated washing or general wear and tear. 2. Compatibility: Some sock materials may not bond well with the adhesive on the patches, leading to an inefficient grip or uneven distribution of the added friction. Solution 2: Puffy paint In this solution, puffy paint or 3D fabric paint is applied to the bottom of the socks to create a pattern of raised, textured dots or lines that will enhance grip. Advantages: 1. Creativity: You can create custom patterns and designs, making the process fun for both the caregiver and child. 2. Affordability: Puffy paint is generally inexpensive and can be found at most craft stores or online. 3. Versatility: The paint can be used on numerous sock materials, allowing it to be a more versatile solution. Disadvantages: 1. Time-consuming: Applying and perfecting intricate patterns may be time-consuming, and the paint must be allowed to dry completely before the socks are wearable. 2. Reapplication: Since the puffy paint can wear off over time, especially after repeated washing and wear, reapplication may be necessary. 3. Safety concerns: Ensure that the paint is non-toxic and safe for children, as they may come into contact with their mouths. Taking the advantages and disadvantages of both solutions into account, it appears that Solution 2 (puffy paint) is the more sound choice in terms of naive physics reasoning. It offers greater versatility, customizability, and compatibility with various sock materials. Using both creative designs and purposeful application, the puffy paint offers improved grip where it is needed most. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as practicality, cost, and convenience, when determining which solution is more suitable for the specific situation. Both solutions can improve grip on toddler socks, but the best choice depends on the individual's preferences and resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the prospective new owner of The Washington Post, assured newsroom employees on Wednesday that he was committed to preserving quality journalism, investing in news and making sure The Post adhered to his underlying philosophy about content: “Don’t be boring.”                              Over the course of the day, he gave some indication of the kind of journalism that interested him, answered questions about the Post’s coverage of Amazon and did not disguise his interest at the intersection of his businesses, telling an afternoon meeting that “it should be as easy to get a subscription to The Post as it is to buy diapers on Amazon,” according to one employee who attended the meeting.      The two-day visit was Mr. Bezos’s first trip to The Post since he agreed to buy the paper in early August for 250 million. Before the deal closes in October, Mr. Bezos made the visit to chat with employees from both the business and editorial sides about his plans for the company. By the end of his visit late Wednesday, Mr. Bezos seemed to have won over employees who posted photographs of him, speculated on how many electronic devices he had in his pockets, liberally quoted his thoughts on the news business on social media and gave him the hashtag #bezospalooza.      Photo      “He charmed the room of 20 hard-bitten journalists,” said Jeffrey Leen, The Post’s investigations editor, who attended a lunch meeting with Mr. Bezos. “He was a big supporter of investigative reporting, which warmed my heart. He already has a very good grasp of our business. It was, all in all, a very impressive performance.”      Mr. Bezos started the day Wednesday with an hourlong breakfast with Bob Woodward in the ninth-floor publisher’s private dining room, where the two men dined on a fruit plate, poached eggs, spinach, coffee and orange juice. Mr. Woodward said in an e-mail after the meeting that through the breakfast, “Jeff Bezos explained the thinking behind his reasoned and careful step-by-step process in deciding to buy The Post.”      Mr. Woodward added, “I was struck by how wide-ranging and methodical he is. He voiced strong, even intense, optimism about the future of The Post, and I suspect he will be calling on everyone here to pitch in with extra amounts of energy, focus and creativity.”      Mr. Bezos then met for a little more than an hour for coffee with about 20 reporters in a neighboring ninth-floor conference room and talked about how he defined success.      “What’s been happening over the last several years can’t continue to happen,” he said.      Mr. Bezos told reporters that the paper should focus on delivering important, compelling stories to its readers. If it does that, advertisers will come, he said. Several reporters said that message left them upbeat after the meeting, convinced that Mr. Bezos was committed to high-quality journalism.      “You got the feeling that he is not here to just take The Washington Post brand name and turn it into something else,” said one reporter who attended and spoke anonymously. “This is not somebody who is in a panic trying to make a profit for next year. He wants to solve it in a way that will endure for decades.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      For lunch, Mr. Bezos met with senior editors for a buffet of chicken, salmon, salad and cookies. Mr. Bezos mentioned that some of The Post’s recent coverage that he had found especially intriguing included the articles “9 Questions about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask“, and the obituary of a bouncer at The 9:30 Club, a well-known Washington club.      In the late afternoon, Mr. Bezos met with the entire newsroom in the first-floor community room for a question-and-answer session that lasted an hour and 20 minutes. That was the most widely chronicled event, with employees posting Twitter messages and comments — or what they called “Bezosisms” — every few minutes. Mr. Bezos answered questions about why he decided to buy The Post and why he would be interested in buying a newspaper when Amazon had a reputation for being slow to answer reporters’ questions.      Erik Wemple, the Post’s media reporter, quoted him on Twitter as saying, “I’ve always felt that the most powerful minds in the world can hold powerful inconsistencies.”      Toward the end of the session, Mr. Bezos addressed more difficult questions like the possible conflict of interest between The Post and Amazon’s contract for computer work with the Central Intelligence Agency. One employee, who attended the session but did not feel comfortable speaking on the record about his future owner, said that while Mr. Bezos “danced around” his answer, he added that he expected The Post to aggressively cover this relationship.      Mr. Bezos may have offered his most assuring comments when asked about his thoughts on journalism’s future. In a post, Cara Ann Kelly, The Washington Post’s Style Web producer, quoted him as saying, “If it’s hopeless — I would feel sorry for you guys — but I wouldn’t want to join you.” ||||| Jeffrey P. Bezos, the incoming owner of The Washington Post and founder and chief executive of Amazon, is pictured during his first visit to the newspaper’s office after agreeing to buy The Post for 250 million.      Sept. 4, 2013 Jeffrey P. Bezos, the incoming owner of The Washington Post and founder and chief executive of Amazon, is pictured during his first visit to the newspaper’s office after agreeing to buy The Post for 250 million. Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post      Jeffrey P. Bezos had a simple bit of advice for the staff of the newspaper he’ll soon own: Put readers, not advertisers, first. Don’t write to impress each other. And above all, “Don’t be boring.”      In a whirlwind series of meetings over two days, the Amazon.com billionaire charmed and disarmed rooms full of skeptical journalists with a relentlessly upbeat vision that evoked The Washington Post’s best traditions while promising to update them for a technologically advanced new era.      The Bezos plan for the news organization he has agreed to buy for 250 million centers on recreating the “daily ritual” of reading The Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories. He was bullish about creating that experience on tablet computers, lukewarm about the prospects of doing so on the Web, and reassuring about the future of the old-fashioned newspaper itself — at least for the foreseeable future.      “People will buy a package,” Bezos said at one meeting of reporters and editors. “They will not pay for a story.”      Bezos seemed relaxed throughout two days of meetings, including a town-hall-style session in The Post’s community room before hundreds of journalists. He spoke without notes and joked often, punctuating some of his witticisms and self-deprecating comments with explosive laughter. He remained poised and good-humored from his perch on stage at the town-hall meeting despite fighting a balky sound system.      Jeff Bezos, the Internet mogul and Amazon.com founder, recently purchased The Washington Post in a historic shift for the newspaper. (Nicki DeMarco and Emi Kolawole/The Washington Post)      Bezos also repeatedly emphasized the importance of investigative journalism and said he was prepared to stand up to pressure in reporting stories that government officials might seek to suppress. He also said his political views were already in line with those of The Post’s editorial page and would defer to its editor, Fred Hiatt, on many matters.      “I don’t feel the need to have an opinion on every issue,” Bezos said. “I’m sure I don’t know much about things like Syria and foreign entanglements. I’m happy to let the experts opine on that.”      Among those in attendance at the newsroom-wide meeting were former executive editors Ben Bradlee and Leonard Downie Jr., former managing editor Robert Kaiser and star investigative reporter Bob Woodward, lending the event an intergenerational bridge to the newspaper’s storied past. (Donald E. Graham, whose family controlled the newspaper for 80 years, was not there, but his niece, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth, was in attendance).      After 90 minutes of hearing Bezos lay out his thoughts, Bradlee, 92, counted himself among those who came away with a positive first impression. “I thought he was original,” he said. “That’s what impressed me the most.”      Throughout the day, Bezos returned to his idea of using tablets as a key vehicle for reaching a new generation of readers. While saying The Post’s print editions will remain for many years, he said tablet computers could offer readers a look and feel similar to a traditional printed paper.      “You have to figure out: How can we make the new thing? Because you have to acknowledge that the physical print business is in structural decline,” he said. “You can’t pretend that that’s not the case. You have to accept it and move forward. . . . The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past, no matter how good it was, especially for an institution like The Washington Post, which has such a hallowed past.”      In comments that cheered the newsroom, Bezos said The Post needed to grow in both revenue and readers, though he declined to say whether The Post newsroom would grow. “What has been happening over the last several years can’t continue to happen,” he said. “If every year we cut the newsroom a little more and a little more and a little more, we know where that ends.”      Or as he put it repeatedly in meetings: “All businesses need to be forever young. . . . If your customer base ages with you as a company, you’re Woolworth’s.”      Asked about the irony of his interest in buying a newspaper and Amazon’s practice of not commenting for many news stories, Bezos laughed and responded, “The most powerful minds can hold powerful inconsistencies.” He said one reason he often declines to comment is because he does not want his competition to know about his plans. “We’re not as silent or secretive as we’re sometimes portrayed,” he said of Amazon, conceding that “we are on the quiet side.”      Bezos, who will remain in Seattle after his purchase of The Post closes in October, sidestepped a question about his future involvement in the Washington area. “I would never out-Don Don. Impossible,” he said, referring to Graham. “I will have to do this as Jeff. And it’s going to be different for so many reasons, and one of them is that I’m going to be in Seattle.”      When asked to discuss Amazon’s motives in cutting off Web services for WikiLeaks in 2010, a time of intense government scrutiny of the anti-secrecy site’s disclosure of confidential military and diplomatic documents, Bezos said that the decision was made by unit managers and was not the result of government pressure. The company has previously said that WikiLeaks violated Amazon’s terms of service.      Yet Bezos made clear that though he believes in “American exceptionalism,” he sees The Post’s traditional watchdog roles as essential.      “We’re not perfect and our elected officials are not perfect and our regulators are not perfect,” he said in the newsroom question-and-answer session. “The credibility that an organization like The Washington Post brings is incredibly important.”      The reaction to the new boss from around The Post’s newsroom was widely favorable.      “What was most impressive was the combination of humility — that he doesn’t have all the answers yet — and the confidence that he will somehow figure it out,” said Marc Fisher, a veteran reporter and former Metro columnist.      Added Valerie Strauss, another Post veteran, who writes an education blog: “There was a lot he didn’t say, but what he did was well received. It’s going to be a very different place.”      Post reporters have already begun to refer to Bezos as “El Jeffe,” a play on the Spanish word for “chief” or “boss.”      He ended what amounted to a two-day charm offensive by recalling for the newsroom his own encounter, as a young boy in the 1970s, with the impact of Post journalism.      After apologizing for potentially embarrassing Woodward, Bezos said: “I watched the Watergate hearings on my elbow on the living-room floor next to my grandfather, who didn’t turn them off. And so these things make an impression.”      Steven Mufson contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"In 2013, Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, purchased The Washington Post for 250 million.

On the train he meets Werner (Tadeusz Åomnicki), an old Communist. Witek decides to join the Communist Party. On a walk with Werner, Witek meets up with Czuszka (BogusÅawa Pawelec), his first love. The two meet up and have sex, after which a disappointed Czuszka discovers that Witek is applying to join the party. Witek unsuccessfully tries to solve a problem with an airline mechanic. Witek breaks up a sit-in at a hospital. As a reward, a party leader plans to send Witek on a special mission to France. On a walk with Czuszka, a policeman asks them for their papers. Since Witek is a Communist, he is allowed to go on his way, while Czuszka is detained. He attempts to make up with Czuszka, who is speaking at an opposition meeting, but she rejects him.

Plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

The animated Disney musical “Moana” was again the No. 1 draw at North American multiplexes, collecting an estimated 28.4 million, for a two-week total of 119.9 million. “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” (Warner Bros.) was second, taking in 18.5 million, for a three-week domestic total of 183.5 million — officially blockbuster territory, especially when adding the 424.4 million in international ticket sales. Several art films hoping for Oscar attention played to mixed results in limited release. “Jackie” (Fox Searchlight), starring Natalie Portman as a calculating Jacqueline Kennedy, arrived in five theaters and collected a stout 275,000, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. “Miss Sloane” (EuropaCorp), starring Jessica Chastain as a political powerbroker, sold 123,036 in tickets in four theaters. “Lion” (the Weinstein Company), an adoption drama starring Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, managed 120,234 in seven theaters, for a two-week total of 279,382. In its third weekend, the acclaimed drama “Manchester by the Sea” (Roadside Attractions), starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, had ticket sales of 2.4 million at 156 theaters, for a new total of 4.4 million. The first weekend in December can be a rare dead zone on Hollywood’s release calendar. Studios hold back new films because people tend to be too worn out from Thanksgiving or too busy with Christmas-related chores to squeeze in a trip to the movies. Starting on Friday, however, studios will roll out 15 major films during 17 days in a race to capitalize on holiday vacations. (When in doubt, take Aunt Edna to the movies.)

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, lobbying and education. IUCN's mission is to \\"influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\\"  - Pirkanmaa (also known as Tampere Region in government documents), is a region of Finland. It borders on the regions of Satakunta, Tavastia Proper, Päijät-Häme, Southern Ostrobothnia, Central Finland and Southwest Finland.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - A swamp is a wetland that is forested. Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations. Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes. Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation. The two main types of swamp are \\"true\\" or swamp forests and \\"transitional\\" or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog or muskeg. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water or seawater. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an \\"asar\\", \\"osar\\", or \\"serpent kame\\", is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their peculiar uniform shape, are somewhat like railway embankments.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - A drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting, or (in Canada) height of land, is the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins.

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - The Finnish forest reindeer \\"(Rangifer tarandus fennicus)\\" (Finnish:\\" metsäpeura\\", Russian: \\"  \\") is a rare and threatened subspecies of reindeer native to Finland and northwestern Russia. They are found primarily in Russian Karelia, and the provinces of North Karelia, Savonia and Kainuu in Finland, though some range into central south Finland. They are distinct from the semi-domesticated Northern reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus tarandus\\") in their larger size and preference for dense boreal forest habitat, where they are rarely seen by humans, over the open tundra. They migrate seasonally back and forth across the long Russo-Finnish border.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Seitseminen National Park ( Finnish : Seitsemisen kansallispuisto ) is located in the municipalities of Ikaalinen and Ylöjärvi in Finland . The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989 . It now covers 45.5 square kilometres ( 17.6 sq mi ) . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region . Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted ( Scots pine ) and shrublike ( Norway spruce ) . These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities . Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland . The Kovero Farm ( Finnish : Koveron kruununmetsätorppa ) , a tenant farm established in 1859 , is part of the cultural heritage area of the park . Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on June 19 , 1996 . It was valid until June 2011 .  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Ikaalinen is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Pirkanmaa region. The town has a population of  () and covers an area of of which  is water. The population density is  - The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) is one of six commissions of the IUCN (World Conservation Union). WCPA is the world's premier network of protected area expertise. It is administered by IUCN's Global Protected Areas Programme and has over 2,400 members, spanning 140 countries.  - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term.  - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.  - Tampere (Swedish: \\"Tammerfors\\" ) is a city in Pirkanmaa, southern Finland. It is the most populous inland city in any of the Nordic countries.  - Suomenselkä is a drainage divide in western Finland. Roughly long and wide, it is marked by an ensemble of northeast-southwest oriented moraines parallel to the Bothnian coastline. Rivers flowing west from Suomenselkä drain to the Gulf of Bothnia and the lakes in the east drain to the Gulf of Finland. Historically, this very sparsely populated region separated Ostrobothnia from the southern and eastern lake regions of Finland. The landscape is marked by moraines, eskers, swamps and forests and is difficult to cultivate or settle in. Because it contains some of the few remaining patches of old-growth forest in southern Finland, it is one of the few remaining habitats for Finnish Forest Reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus fennica\\").  - A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - An old-growth forest  also termed primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or (in Britain) ancient woodland  is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitat that increases the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem. The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps, greatly varying tree heights and diameters, and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris.  - Ylöjärvi is a town and a municipality in Western Finland, west of Tampere and north of Finlands capital city Helsinki.

After a rooftop chase, where his fear of heights and vertigo result in the death of a policeman, San Francisco detective John \\"Scottie\\" Ferguson retires. Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his friend and ex-fiancÃ©e Midge Wood says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers, to the Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s and the grave of Carlotta Valdes, and to an art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but on investigation she does not seem to be there. A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide. Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this, and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and, when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her. The next day Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet and spend the day together.

This is accompanied by a blunt bass line and frenetic drumming. The song's dirty sound was produced using an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion pedal, which is augmented by a second guitar providing more distortion. Music writer Brian J. Barr referred to this noisy sound as \\"the sonic equivalent of an amplified comb scraping against paper\\".Critics have noted a Stooges influence in \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: \\"In retrospect, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by way of The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. At the time I was trying for the stuttering R&B guitar of The Nights and Days.\\" The song is also reminiscent of the hardcore punk of Black Flag.

The Post notes that all three election models agree that the GOP is likely to pick up seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, while Democrats will probably hang on to North Carolina and New Hampshire—leaving Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas as the races to watch. Harry Reid says the Iowa race will be crucial for Senate control, although there is a chance control may not be decided today, or even this month. More: Mitt Romney believes the polls this time around and he's confident about the GOP's chances, the Hill reports. This election is the \\"last chance\\" for voters to \\"pass judgment,\\" says Romney, who has campaigned for Republicans across the country but hasn't indicated he's planning a third bid for the presidency. Despite an economy that's slowly finding its stride, polls indicate voter interest is \\"substantially lower\\" than it was four years ago, with a populace worn down by ISIS and Ebola, the Times reports. Lackluster candidates comparing each other to Taylor Swift and clown cars haven't helped. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell—heavily favored to win his race in Kentucky—may soon be the body's majority leader, and he told a crowd last night that the rollback of President Obama's policies will begin today, Politico reports. \\"These people need to be stopped and it starts tomorrow night,\\" he said. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to limit their losses in an election that also stands to give the GOP its biggest share of the House since it held 246 seats in 1946, the AP reports. Democratic incumbents are struggling in many of today's 36 gubernatorial contests as well, but the party holds out hope that a huge get-out-the-vote operation will save its Senate majority. And if the Republicans do usurp Senate power? They'll have pulled off a \\"spectacular feat,\\" as NPR puts it, with a victory despite their \\"non-transformation\\"—in other words, without changing a platform that was supposedly destined to doom them, like opposition to ObamaCare, gay marriage, and abortion rights.

The consensus among these models suggests that the GOP (Republican Party) is poised to gain seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, while Democrats are likely to hold on to North Carolina and New Hampshire. Key races in Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas will be crucial in determining the final outcome. Many eyes are on the Iowa race, which Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid believes will be pivotal for Senate control. However, the possibility remains that control may not be decided on Election Day, or even within this month. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has weighed in, expressing confidence in the GOP's chances and stressing that this election is the \\"last chance\\" for voters to \\"pass judgment\\" on the current administration. Despite a gradually improving economy, voter interest has been \\"substantially lower\\" than in previous elections, as ongoing concerns about ISIS and Ebola have consumed the American public's attention. Additionally, lackluster candidates with forgettable campaign strategies have done little to engage voters and inspire them to participate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is expected to win his race in Kentucky, may be in line to become the body's majority leader. At a recent rally, he pledged that if the GOP wins control of the Senate, they will begin to roll back President Obama's policies. \\"These people need to be stopped, and it starts tomorrow night,\\" McConnell said.

We are assuming that the greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull between them. Now, let's analyze the given assumption: - The greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull between them. Given this assumption, we can determine the following: - Since the very small mass planets have lower masses than the small mass planets, they will have a weaker gravitational pull between them, as per the assumption provided.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Good read Review: I had to get this book for a class, and honestly I like it. I have always hated and been bad at history, so when I looked at it, I would get sick. However, after opening and reading through the majority of it, I must say that I would recommend this book to everyone. It is very educational and understandable. Ironically, I have never been able to keep up with a timeline of events and memorization of history, and I understood everything that was being explained. Definitely get this book! Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"There is a positive tone to this product review. The reviewer initially expresses their dislike for history, but they go on to share their positive experience with the book, stating that it is educational, understandable, and worth recommending to others. They also mention being able to easily comprehend the content, which they had previously struggled with in the past. Overall, the review speaks highly of the book and encourages others to read it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's important to know that these questions may not be suitable for a five-year-old. However, I will try my best to explain in an appropriate and simple way. 1. When two grown-ups love each other, sometimes they share special hugs or cuddles called sex. This is one way adults show love and affection for one another, and it's something that happens privately. 2. The second question is about how often grown-ups share those special hugs. Just like people have different tastes in food or clothes, couples also have their own preferences for how often they share special hugs. These two questions are not asking the same thing. The first one is about how it happens, while the second one is about how often it happens."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, let me help you understand these questions: Question 1 is asking if Israel will be cold in February. They want to know about the weather in that specific month. Question 2 is asking about the weather in Nagpur in February, and if it will be as cold as North India during that time. They want to compare the temperature of Nagpur to North India in February.

CONTEXT: Las reservas de oro y divisas de Rusia subieron 800 millones de dólares y el 26 de mayo equivalían a 19.100 millones de dólares, informó hoy un comunicado del Banco Central. Según el informe, el 19 de mayo las reservas de oro y divisas del Banco Central eran de 18.300 millones de dólares. Los activos en divisas en poder del Banco Central y el Ministerio de Finanzas se calculan en dólares estadounidenses y su valor depende del cambio oficial rublo-dólar que establece el Banco Central. Las reservas en oro se valoran en base a 300 dólares estadounidenses por cada onza troy de oro. El presidente de la Generalitat, Jordi Pujol, cree necesario que el Gobierno agilice los permisos de residencia a los inmigrantes para poder responder a la falta de mano de obra en Cataluña que, según cálculos del Departamento de Trabajo, impide cubrir unos 23.000 empleos en diversos sectores. Pujol urgió la necesidad de esta medida legal durante una cena organizada anoche por la patronal de la pequeña y mediana empresa, Pimec-Sefes, en la que también advirtió a los empresarios, sindicatos y administraciones a que cumplan con la normativa laboral en materia de prevención de la siniestralidad. Según Pujol, \\"no puede ser que se tarde ocho meses para dar un permiso de residencia de trabajo a un ciudadano polaco\\", en un momento de falta de mano de obra que actúa, en su opinión, como freno al crecimiento económico. QUESTION: ¿Cuánto oro posee Rusia en reserva?","output":"Para determinar cuánto oro posee Rusia en reservas, necesitamos información adicional en la que se especifique el peso del oro en onzas troy o alguna otra medida. La información proporcionada solo incluye el valor total de las reservas y el precio por onza troy de oro, pero no la cantidad exacta de oro."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. the commission addresses the heads of government in a declaration on the state of the community. Make this proper case","output":"The Commission Addresses the Heads of Government in a Declaration on the State of the Community Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed heads of government, distinguished delegates, and valued citizens of the global community, It is with great responsibility and a sense of urgency that the Commission has convened to address the current state of our shared community. As we navigate through challenging times and confront complex issues, effective communication and cooperation between our governments remain of paramount importance. Therefore, the Commission hereby presents this declaration to provide insights into the state of our community, express our concerns, and propose recommendations for a collaborative path forward. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that our community has made tremendous progress over recent decades in various areas, such as global health, economic growth, and technological advancement. Notable achievements, such as the eradication of diseases, the rapid progression of the digital revolution, and increased global connectivity, have significantly improved the lives of millions across the globe. However, it is also essential to recognize the challenges we face collectively. These challenges demand our attention and timely, coherent action to preserve the well-being of our global community. Among these pressing issues are: 1. Climate Change: The increasing threat of climate change is one of the most urgent global crises. The consequences of rising temperatures, severe weather events, and increased greenhouse gas emissions disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We must work diligently to adopt sustainable energy sources, promote environmentally-friendly practices, and reduce our collective carbon footprint to safeguard the planet for future generations. 2. Economic Inequality: Despite economic growth, income and wealth inequality remains a tremendous concern. The widening gap between the rich and the poor, both within and across countries, can lead to social unrest and political instability. It is our responsibility to develop and implement inclusive and equitable economic policies that facilitate wealth redistribution, ensuring that all citizens can benefit from growth and prosperity. 3. Migration and Displacement: Currently, millions of people are in forced migration and displacement situations due to climate change, conflict, and socio-economic hardships. This crisis not only places immense strain on the countries hosting these individuals but also threatens the social fabric of these displaced communities. To address this challenge, we must implement comprehensive policies to address displacement root causes, support refugees and migrants, and facilitate successful integration into host countries. 4. Global Health: Global health remains a significant concern as new diseases and pandemics emerge. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the impact of global health crises on economies, societies, and individuals. We must invest in robust health systems, promote international collaboration on medical research, and work towards providing universal healthcare coverage to achieve optimal health outcomes for all citizens. 5. Technological Advancement and Access: As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through technology, digital access has become essential for economic, educational, and social opportunities. However, a digital divide exists, particularly in underdeveloped and rural communities, where millions lack access to high-speed internet and advanced technologies. Closing this gap will require investment in digital infrastructure, promotion of digital literacy, and policies that ensure equal access to the benefits of technology. In conclusion, the Commission urges the heads of governments to engage in open dialogue, share best practices, and establish global partnerships to address the challenges that our community faces. We believe that by joining forces and fostering collaborative and inclusive approaches, we can create a more just, sustainable, healthy, and prosperous world for all. Let this declaration serve as the starting point for our collective actions, guided by our shared commitment to the well-being and advancement of the global community."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function q(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",E,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
